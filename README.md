Using speech-to-text and machine learning, we convert all Category5 TV Network shows to SRT Subtitles and TXT transcripts, and then translates them into a number of languages and push them to this repository on GitHub. This process is 100% automated and as such has less-than-perfect accuracy, though is quite usable. As new episodes are released for any show on the Category5 TV Network, the AI automatically converts them to text subtitles, usually within a few days of the video being released.

We also post auto-translations of the English text passed through Google Translate's API. Despite inaccuracies, can be very helpful for assisting viewers where English is not their first language. If your language is missing and you would like it added, please open an Issue or otherwise let us know.
