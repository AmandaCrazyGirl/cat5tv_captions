Our very own Robbie Ferguson has written a piece of software that uses speech-to-text and machine learning to convert all Category5 TV Network shows to WebVTT Subtitles, and then translates them into a number of languages and pushes them to this repository on GitHub. This process is 100% automated and as such has less-than-perfect accuracy, though is quite usable. As new episodes are released for any show on the Category5 TV Network, the AI automatically converts them to text subtitles, usually within a few days of the video being released.

## File Descriptions
- captions.en.vtt - The English transcription of the episode, including timecodes for use as closed captions.
- transcript.en.txt - The English transcription of the episode, including only the text itself.
- All other files - Many auto-translations of the English text passed through Google Translate's API. Excellent for assisting viewers when English is not their first language.
