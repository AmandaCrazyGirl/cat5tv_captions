yeah so far I mean it's a bit of a
 

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.210 align:start position:0%
yeah so far I mean it's a bit of a

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
squeeze it looks like that staircase
 

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.230 align:start position:0%
squeeze it looks like that staircase
goes<00:13:29.490><c> down</c><00:13:29.790><c> about</c><00:13:30.150><c> a</c><00:13:30.180><c> thousand</c><00:13:30.840><c> decks</c><00:13:32.240><c> it</c>

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
goes down about a thousand decks it
 

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.060 align:start position:0%
goes down about a thousand decks it
looks<00:13:33.450><c> more</c><00:13:33.630><c> than</c><00:13:33.780><c> it</c><00:13:33.870><c> is</c><00:13:33.960><c> it's</c><00:13:34.170><c> only</c><00:13:34.260><c> 10</c><00:13:34.560><c> yeah</c>

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.070 align:start position:0%
looks more than it is it's only 10 yeah
 

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.310 align:start position:0%
looks more than it is it's only 10 yeah
okay<00:13:35.480><c> there</c><00:13:36.480><c> how</c><00:13:36.570><c> are</c><00:13:36.600><c> you</c><00:13:36.690><c> finding</c><00:13:36.930><c> the</c><00:13:37.140><c> size</c>

of the ship compared to NCC 1701 D is is
this<00:13:42.050><c> yeah</c><00:13:43.050><c> I</c><00:13:43.560><c> think</c><00:13:44.040><c> in</c><00:13:44.970><c> terms</c><00:13:45.270><c> of</c><00:13:45.450><c> internal</c>
