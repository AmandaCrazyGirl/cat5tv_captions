00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 align:start position:0%
from the old traditional medium I guess
 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.230 align:start position:0%
from the old traditional medium I guess
because<00:05:13.290><c> Fox</c><00:05:13.530><c> being</c><00:05:13.800><c> a</c><00:05:13.950><c> terrestrial</c><00:05:14.580><c> station</c>

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
because Fox being a terrestrial station
 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.690 align:start position:0%
because Fox being a terrestrial station
as<00:05:15.360><c> well</c><00:05:15.570><c> as</c><00:05:15.840><c> digital</c><00:05:16.080><c> yeah</c><00:05:16.680><c> and</c><00:05:17.190><c> puts</c><00:05:17.400><c> it</c><00:05:17.520><c> on</c>

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 align:start position:0%

exclusively<00:05:18.510><c> digital</c><00:05:19.190><c> format</c><00:05:20.190><c> so</c><00:05:20.490><c> it</c><00:05:21.240><c> makes</c>

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
exclusively digital format so it makes
 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
exclusively digital format so it makes
me<00:05:21.630><c> wonder</c><00:05:21.810><c> if</c><00:05:21.990><c> Fox</c><00:05:22.320><c> will</c><00:05:22.590><c> still</c><00:05:22.920><c> air</c><00:05:23.220><c> it</c><00:05:23.490><c> but</c>

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 align:start position:0%
me wonder if Fox will still air it but
 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.270 align:start position:0%
me wonder if Fox will still air it but
only<00:05:24.090><c> after</c><00:05:24.660><c> the</c><00:05:25.290><c> rest</c><00:05:25.500><c> of</c><00:05:25.620><c> the</c><00:05:25.710><c> season</c><00:05:25.920><c> has</c>

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
only after the rest of the season has
