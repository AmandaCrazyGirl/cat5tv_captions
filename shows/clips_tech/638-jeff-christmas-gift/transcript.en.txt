you were away the week that that I was
here all by myself yes and so you missed
out on your Christmas gift Jeff because
I I got a sense of what you've always
wanted
I mean I kind of got a sense what I feel
like I'm being set up here I don't know
it's not set up it's a gift because we
love you or yeah it's a little late I
know it's a belated Christmas gift for
Jeff but I thought this is what he he
just really seemed to have this on his
mind
[Laughter]
oh yeah myth balls don't throw it out a
Tesla cyber truck you just seem to have
that on your mind Jeff and
