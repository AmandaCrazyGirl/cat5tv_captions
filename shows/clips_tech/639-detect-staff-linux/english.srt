we do that well every device has a MAC

124
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:49,980
we do that well every device has a MAC
 

125
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,940
we do that well every device has a MAC
address the MAC address is a private

126
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:52,950
address the MAC address is a private
 

127
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,009
address the MAC address is a private
address that's not available on the web

but it's available on the device and
 

131
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,199
but it's available on the device and
it's available to the DHB dhcp server so

132
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,209
it's available to the DHB dhcp server so
 

133
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,570
it's available to the DHB dhcp server so
your DHCP server that dishes out the IP

134
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:02,580
your DHCP server that dishes out the IP
 

135
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,970
your DHCP server that dishes out the IP
address to every connected device says

137
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,920
address to every connected device says
all right we're gonna give this the next

141
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,310
address in the DHCP pool 10.0.0.0 seven
could be your phone so get into your

147
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,410
Windows DHCP server or maybe you've got
a Linux DHCP server and look at the MAC

148
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,420
a Linux DHCP server and look at the MAC
 

149
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,069
a Linux DHCP server and look at the MAC
address of that device and set up a DHCP

150
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:31,079
address of that device and set up a DHCP
 

151
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,390
address of that device and set up a DHCP
reservation so now every single time I

okay so let's pretend so I've added that
 

255
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,850
okay so let's pretend so I've added that
to the dot CFG file so now if I run that

256
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:23,860
to the dot CFG file so now if I run that
 

257
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,550
to the dot CFG file so now if I run that
file Wi-Fi - check what do you see

10.0.0.0 equals 110 dot 0 dot 0 dot 5 1

261
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,709
10.0.0.0 equals 110 dot 0 dot 0 dot 5 1
equals 0 well what does that tell us

262
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:34,719
equals 0 well what does that tell us
 

263
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:38,010
equals 0 well what does that tell us
ok so we've established Robbie's dot 5 0

264
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,020
ok so we've established Robbie's dot 5 0
 

265
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,600
ok so we've established Robbie's dot 5 0
Sascha's dot 5 1 do you see Sasha Sasha

266
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,610
Sascha's dot 5 1 do you see Sasha Sasha
 

267
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,779
Sascha's dot 5 1 do you see Sasha Sasha
was not here Robbie is so Robbie equals

268
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:45,789
was not here Robbie is so Robbie equals
 

269
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:50,100
was not here Robbie is so Robbie equals
1 Sasha equals 0 1 point 4 Robbie

270
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,110
1 Sasha equals 0 1 point 4 Robbie
 

271
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,520
1 Sasha equals 0 1 point 4 Robbie
so now programmatically we can say ok

272
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:53,530
so now programmatically we can say ok
 

273
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,860
so now programmatically we can say ok
well we can we can program that we can

274
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:55,870
well we can we can program that we can
 

275
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,600
well we can we can program that we can
change that we can manipulate that to

276
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:57,610
change that we can manipulate that to
 

277
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,959
change that we can manipulate that to
say ok is Robbie on line and we can run

278
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:00,969
say ok is Robbie on line and we can run
 

279
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:04,080
say ok is Robbie on line and we can run
that as a cron job right okay so

280
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,090
that as a cron job right okay so
 

281
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,629
that as a cron job right okay so
similarily let's take my smart phone and

282
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
similarily let's take my smart phone and
 

283
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,490
similarily let's take my smart phone and
i'm gonna turn off my Wi-Fi so now my

284
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:08,500
i'm gonna turn off my Wi-Fi so now my
 

285
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,769
i'm gonna turn off my Wi-Fi so now my
Wi-Fi is off I'm gonna run that command

286
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:10,779
Wi-Fi is off I'm gonna run that command
 

287
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,709
Wi-Fi is off I'm gonna run that command
again and watch what happens you can

288
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:13,719
again and watch what happens you can
 

289
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,129
again and watch what happens you can
assume what happens but 10.0.0.0 which

290
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:17,139
assume what happens but 10.0.0.0 which
 

291
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,640
assume what happens but 10.0.0.0 which
we've already established as Robbie he's

292
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:20,650
we've already established as Robbie he's
 

293
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,950
we've already established as Robbie he's
going to timeout and it's gonna say zero

294
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
going to timeout and it's gonna say zero
 

295
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,459
going to timeout and it's gonna say zero
so now we know that both Robbie and

296
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:26,469
so now we know that both Robbie and
 

297
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:29,640
so now we know that both Robbie and
Sasha are gone from the building I've

298
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:29,650
Sasha are gone from the building I've
 

299
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,649
Sasha are gone from the building I've
turned on my Wi-Fi and I'm gonna run

300
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:31,659
turned on my Wi-Fi and I'm gonna run
 

301
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,570
turned on my Wi-Fi and I'm gonna run
that command again and now we can see

302
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:33,580
that command again and now we can see
 

303
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,070
that command again and now we can see
Robbie's back Sasha's still not here so

304
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080

gonna be able to do this so let's look
 

337
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,600
gonna be able to do this so let's look
at that source code and see what it's

338
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:15,610
at that source code and see what it's
 

339
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,719
at that source code and see what it's
actually doing so I'm gonna edit Wi-Fi -

use case so then it pings it well that's

378
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,110
use case so then it pings it well that's
 

379
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,170
use case so then it pings it well that's
all it does it just pings it there it is

380
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,180
all it does it just pings it there it is
 

381
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,770
all it does it just pings it there it is
ping and it pings the host and if it is

382
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:17,780
ping and it pings the host and if it is
 

383
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,710
ping and it pings the host and if it is
up it responds with one and if it's down

384
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
up it responds with one and if it's down
 

385
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,380
up it responds with one and if it's down
it responds with zero okay well what

386
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,390
it responds with zero okay well what
 

387
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,300
it responds with zero okay well what
good is that if it responds with 1 or 0

388
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,310
good is that if it responds with 1 or 0
 

389
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,520
good is that if it responds with 1 or 0
you know what what do I do with that

390
