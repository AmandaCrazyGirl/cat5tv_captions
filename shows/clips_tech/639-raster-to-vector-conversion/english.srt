00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,780

when I'm working on websites or when I'm

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:05,790
when I'm working on websites or when I'm
 

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,930
when I'm working on websites or when I'm
working on any kind of graphic projects

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:08,940
working on any kind of graphic projects
 

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,080
working on any kind of graphic projects
quite often I request a vector image

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,090
quite often I request a vector image
 

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,720
quite often I request a vector image
from my client and the client may say oh

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:14,730
from my client and the client may say oh
 

9
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,849
from my client and the client may say oh
well we don't have such a thing or even

10
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:16,859
well we don't have such a thing or even
 

11
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,120
well we don't have such a thing or even
better yet what the heck is a vector

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,130
better yet what the heck is a vector
 

13
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,910
better yet what the heck is a vector
image right so so maybe that's the

14
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:22,920
image right so so maybe that's the
 

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,349
image right so so maybe that's the
question I have to answer first so a

16
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:24,359
question I have to answer first so a
 

17
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,519
question I have to answer first so a
raster image or a flattened image like a

18
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:28,529
raster image or a flattened image like a
 

19
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,870
raster image or a flattened image like a
JPEG or a painting or bitmap is it's

20
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
JPEG or a painting or bitmap is it's
 

21
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
JPEG or a painting or bitmap is it's
what's called a rasterized image so that

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:34,890
what's called a rasterized image so that
 

23
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,770
what's called a rasterized image so that
image is set to the dimensions that the

24
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:39,780
image is set to the dimensions that the
 

25
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,819
image is set to the dimensions that the
creator had saved it as so let's say a

26
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:43,829
creator had saved it as so let's say a
 

27
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,670
creator had saved it as so let's say a
video is 1920 by 1080 so if you have a

28
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:46,680
video is 1920 by 1080 so if you have a
 

29
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,979
video is 1920 by 1080 so if you have a
screenshot from that video that screen

30
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:48,989
screenshot from that video that screen
 

31
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,860
screenshot from that video that screen
shot is going to be 1920 by 1080 now you

32
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:51,870
shot is going to be 1920 by 1080 now you
 

33
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,369
shot is going to be 1920 by 1080 now you
can scale that down and it's gonna look

34
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:55,379
can scale that down and it's gonna look
 

35
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,200
can scale that down and it's gonna look
great you can shrink it and it's gonna

36
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,210
great you can shrink it and it's gonna
 

37
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,380
great you can shrink it and it's gonna
look fantastic however if you ever tried

38
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,390
look fantastic however if you ever tried
 

39
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,939
look fantastic however if you ever tried
to make it bigger so let's say you

40
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:01,949
to make it bigger so let's say you
 

41
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,359
to make it bigger so let's say you
wanted to fit it on a 4k screen well now

42
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,369
wanted to fit it on a 4k screen well now
 

43
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,649
wanted to fit it on a 4k screen well now
what you're doing is you're taking that

44
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:06,659
what you're doing is you're taking that
 

45
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,440
what you're doing is you're taking that
1080 piece screenshot and you're

46
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,450
1080 piece screenshot and you're
 

47
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,530
1080 piece screenshot and you're
stretching it and well how does a

48
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:12,540
stretching it and well how does a
 

49
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,450
stretching it and well how does a
computer stretch an image well it

50
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,460
computer stretch an image well it
 

51
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,210
computer stretch an image well it
recreates all the pixels it stretches

52
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,220
recreates all the pixels it stretches
 

53
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,300
recreates all the pixels it stretches
them and each pixel is stretched so

54
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,310
them and each pixel is stretched so
 

55
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,789
them and each pixel is stretched so
eventually when you get big enough

56
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
eventually when you get big enough
 

57
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,770
eventually when you get big enough
you're gonna get distortion you're gonna

58
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:24,780
you're gonna get distortion you're gonna
 

59
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,469
you're gonna get distortion you're gonna
get blurriness and this happens when you

60
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:27,479
get blurriness and this happens when you
 

61
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,649
get blurriness and this happens when you
take a logo it's a perfect example when

62
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:30,659
take a logo it's a perfect example when
 

63
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,929
take a logo it's a perfect example when
you take a little logo from a website

64
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939
you take a little logo from a website
 

65
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,080
you take a little logo from a website
and you try to print it on a billboard

66
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,090
and you try to print it on a billboard
 

67
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,609
and you try to print it on a billboard
well that's not gonna look good and

68
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:37,619
well that's not gonna look good and
 

69
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,410
well that's not gonna look good and
somebody with some quality control is

70
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,420
somebody with some quality control is
 

71
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,020
somebody with some quality control is
gonna tell you don't do that we need a

72
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,030
gonna tell you don't do that we need a
 

73
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,210
gonna tell you don't do that we need a
vector image well what is the vector

74
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,220
vector image well what is the vector
 

75
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,950
vector image well what is the vector
image how can I get a vector image I

76
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
image how can I get a vector image I
 

77
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,649
image how can I get a vector image I
don't have one okay so then myself as a

78
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:51,659
don't have one okay so then myself as a
 

79
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,520
don't have one okay so then myself as a
graphic eye I'm not a graphic designer

80
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,530
graphic eye I'm not a graphic designer
 

81
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,469
graphic eye I'm not a graphic designer
but I'll use that term loosely in that

82
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:57,479
but I'll use that term loosely in that
 

83
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,420
but I'll use that term loosely in that
I'll take your graphics and I'll be

84
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,430
I'll take your graphics and I'll be
 

85
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,950
I'll take your graphics and I'll be
quality control and I'll make sure that

86
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
quality control and I'll make sure that
 

87
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,609
quality control and I'll make sure that
it's ready for you for your billboard

88
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:03,619
it's ready for you for your billboard
 

89
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,029
it's ready for you for your billboard
what can I do to help a lot of times you

90
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:07,039
what can I do to help a lot of times you
 

91
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,449
what can I do to help a lot of times you
have access to those graphics as raster

92
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:10,459
have access to those graphics as raster
 

93
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,750
have access to those graphics as raster
images but they're not vector so again

94
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
images but they're not vector so again
 

95
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,140
images but they're not vector so again
it's a logo if I scale it up if I make

96
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,150
it's a logo if I scale it up if I make
 

97
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,729
it's a logo if I scale it up if I make
that little logo that's meant for a

98
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:18,739
that little logo that's meant for a
 

99
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,559
that little logo that's meant for a
website and scale it up to a billboard

100
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:20,569
website and scale it up to a billboard
 

101
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,780
website and scale it up to a billboard
it's gonna get all grainy it's gonna get

102
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:22,790
it's gonna get all grainy it's gonna get
 

103
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,119
it's gonna get all grainy it's gonna get
blurry it's gonna get those like blocky

104
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,129
blurry it's gonna get those like blocky
 

105
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,460
blurry it's gonna get those like blocky
pixels it's gonna look terrible in the

106
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,470
pixels it's gonna look terrible in the
 

107
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,619
pixels it's gonna look terrible in the
end so you want to avoid that at all

108
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:29,629
end so you want to avoid that at all
 

109
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,080
end so you want to avoid that at all
costs vector is where it's at vector

110
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,090
costs vector is where it's at vector
 

111
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,920
costs vector is where it's at vector
images are basically the difference is

112
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:35,930
images are basically the difference is
 

113
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,259
images are basically the difference is
instead of a rendered image that has the

114
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:38,269
instead of a rendered image that has the
 

115
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,289
instead of a rendered image that has the
pixels all kind of saved on that canvas

116
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:41,299
pixels all kind of saved on that canvas
 

117
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,370
pixels all kind of saved on that canvas
it's a text file that directs well

118
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:45,380
it's a text file that directs well
 

119
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,039
it's a text file that directs well
here's a curve okay so if this is a

120
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,049
here's a curve okay so if this is a
 

121
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:50,770
here's a curve okay so if this is a
curve that curve is gonna be the same

122
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:50,780
curve that curve is gonna be the same
 

123
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,850
curve that curve is gonna be the same
either this big at that or this big at

124
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:54,860
either this big at that or this big at
 

125
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,420
either this big at that or this big at
that

126
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,430
that
 

127
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,000
that
that's what vector is it's gonna allow

128
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,010
that's what vector is it's gonna allow
 

129
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,920
that's what vector is it's gonna allow
you to scale it up and the curve is

130
00:02:59,920 --> 00:02:59,930
you to scale it up and the curve is
 

131
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,869
you to scale it up and the curve is
gonna stay the same that the image is

132
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:01,879
gonna stay the same that the image is
 

133
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,420
gonna stay the same that the image is
gonna look just as good if you print it

134
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,430
gonna look just as good if you print it
 

135
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,479
gonna look just as good if you print it
on a 500 foot billboard versus and I

136
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:07,489
on a 500 foot billboard versus and I
 

137
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,979
on a 500 foot billboard versus and I
don't know if such a thing exists but if

138
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:08,989
don't know if such a thing exists but if
 

139
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,170
don't know if such a thing exists but if
it does you could print it with a vector

140
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,180
it does you could print it with a vector
 

141
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,150
it does you could print it with a vector
if you took a raster image and did that

142
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,160
if you took a raster image and did that
 

143
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,449
if you took a raster image and did that
it would be horrible but it often comes

144
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:16,459
it would be horrible but it often comes
 

145
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,150
it would be horrible but it often comes
up in my industry and and perhaps you've

146
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,160
up in my industry and and perhaps you've
 

147
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,440
up in my industry and and perhaps you've
encountered this where it's like I don't

148
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,450
encountered this where it's like I don't
 

149
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,900
encountered this where it's like I don't
have a vector so what am I gonna do so

150
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:22,910
have a vector so what am I gonna do so
 

151
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,059
have a vector so what am I gonna do so
today we're looking at how to use Linux

152
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:25,069
today we're looking at how to use Linux
 

153
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,069
today we're looking at how to use Linux

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,099
and free software in order to convert a
raster image into a vector now there are

156
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:33,109
raster image into a vector now there are
 

157
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:34,809
raster image into a vector now there are
online tools that allow you to do this

158
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:34,819
online tools that allow you to do this
 

159
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,449
online tools that allow you to do this
that's cool but if you ever look at the

160
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:37,459
that's cool but if you ever look at the
 

161
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,190
that's cool but if you ever look at the
source code you're gonna realize that

162
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
source code you're gonna realize that
 

163
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,229
source code you're gonna realize that
those online tools that do this for free

164
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:41,239
those online tools that do this for free
 

165
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,559
those online tools that do this for free
all they're doing is quite often not

166
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:44,569
all they're doing is quite often not
 

167
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,900
all they're doing is quite often not
necessarily all they always and it's not

168
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:46,910
necessarily all they always and it's not
 

169
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,750
necessarily all they always and it's not
always the case but quite often those

170
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
always the case but quite often those
 

171
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,620
always the case but quite often those
free tools are taking that raster image

172
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:53,630
free tools are taking that raster image
 

173
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,539
free tools are taking that raster image
and they're putting it in a vector and

174
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:55,549
and they're putting it in a vector and
 

175
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,360
and they're putting it in a vector and
then they're embedding the raster image

176
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,370
then they're embedding the raster image
 

177
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,080
then they're embedding the raster image
into a vector file so it's still raster

178
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,090
into a vector file so it's still raster
 

179
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,280
into a vector file so it's still raster
instead what we want to do is we want to

180
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,290
instead what we want to do is we want to
 

181
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,990
instead what we want to do is we want to
take that image and we want to trace

182
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
take that image and we want to trace
 

183
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,170
take that image and we want to trace
around all of the curves so if there's a

184
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,180
around all of the curves so if there's a
 

185
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,360
around all of the curves so if there's a
letter S

186
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,370
letter S
 

187
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,000
letter S
I want to trace around that letter s so

188
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,010
I want to trace around that letter s so
 

189
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,710
I want to trace around that letter s so
that when I scale it up it's going to

190
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
that when I scale it up it's going to
 

191
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,550
that when I scale it up it's going to
look absolutely perfect well how do I do

192
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
look absolutely perfect well how do I do
 

193
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,110
look absolutely perfect well how do I do
that that sounds like a lot of work

194
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,120
that that sounds like a lot of work
 

195
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,150
that that sounds like a lot of work
because we're thinking in raster terms

196
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
because we're thinking in raster terms
 

197
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,520
because we're thinking in raster terms
right we're thinking in the GNU image

198
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,530
right we're thinking in the GNU image
 

199
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,040
right we're thinking in the GNU image
manipulation program or Photoshop and

200
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,050
manipulation program or Photoshop and
 

201
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,650
manipulation program or Photoshop and
how we'd have to trace around everything

202
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:31,660
how we'd have to trace around everything
 

203
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,120
how we'd have to trace around everything
and it would just be absolutely brutal

204
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,130
and it would just be absolutely brutal
 

205
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,730
and it would just be absolutely brutal
but Linux makes it a lot easier so let's

206
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:35,740
but Linux makes it a lot easier so let's
 

207
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,040
but Linux makes it a lot easier so let's
jump into my terminal I'm going to bring

208
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,050
jump into my terminal I'm going to bring
 

209
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,950
jump into my terminal I'm going to bring
up my computer here and all we need is a

210
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
up my computer here and all we need is a
 

211
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,010
up my computer here and all we need is a
simple program which I'm going to

212
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,020
simple program which I'm going to
 

213
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,950
simple program which I'm going to
install first but then we're gonna grab

214
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
install first but then we're gonna grab
 

215
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,930
install first but then we're gonna grab
a logo off of the web so I'm gonna

216
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:48,940
a logo off of the web so I'm gonna
 

217
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,430
a logo off of the web so I'm gonna
become root so on Linux Mint it's sudo

218
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
become root so on Linux Mint it's sudo
 

219
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,950
become root so on Linux Mint it's sudo
su or su do su for those purists and

su or su do su for those purists and
 

221
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,890
su or su do su for those purists and
enter your password now that I'm the

222
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:01,900
enter your password now that I'm the
 

223
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,800
enter your password now that I'm the
super user so I'm the root user now I

224
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:04,810
super user so I'm the root user now I
 

225
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,230
super user so I'm the root user now I
can type apt update and that's gonna

226
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:07,240
can type apt update and that's gonna
 

227
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,690
can type apt update and that's gonna
grab my latest repository information

228
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:09,700
grab my latest repository information
 

229
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,150
grab my latest repository information
from the web so these are the online

230
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
from the web so these are the online
 

231
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,070
from the web so these are the online
available Linux applications and I'm

232
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
available Linux applications and I'm
 

233
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,409
available Linux applications and I'm
gonna go apt install and there's a

234
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:16,419
gonna go apt install and there's a
 

235
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:21,080
gonna go apt install and there's a
really simple command here p.o trace

236
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,090
really simple command here p.o trace
 

237
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,940
really simple command here p.o trace
that's gonna grab a program called I

238
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:23,950
that's gonna grab a program called I
 

239
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,580
that's gonna grab a program called I
don't know if it's called Poe trace or

240
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:26,590
don't know if it's called Poe trace or
 

241
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,400
don't know if it's called Poe trace or
Pio trace we'll call it Poe trace and

242
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,410
Pio trace we'll call it Poe trace and
 

243
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,159
Pio trace we'll call it Poe trace and
I've said yes now that is installed so

244
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,169
I've said yes now that is installed so
 

245
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,060
I've said yes now that is installed so
if I type Poe trace - - help I should

246
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,070
if I type Poe trace - - help I should
 

247
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,969
if I type Poe trace - - help I should
get a help dialog there that's fantastic

248
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:38,979
get a help dialog there that's fantastic
 

249
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:41,219
get a help dialog there that's fantastic
alright so we've got it installed now

250
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:41,229
alright so we've got it installed now
 

251
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,050
alright so we've got it installed now
let's jump on the web so I'm gonna get

252
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,060
let's jump on the web so I'm gonna get
 

253
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,810
let's jump on the web so I'm gonna get
on here and let's actually you know

254
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:45,820
on here and let's actually you know
 

255
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,440
on here and let's actually you know
let's let's grab the category 5 dot TV

256
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,450
let's let's grab the category 5 dot TV
 

257
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,320
let's let's grab the category 5 dot TV
logo let's see how that's gonna work so

258
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,330
logo let's see how that's gonna work so
 

259
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,270
logo let's see how that's gonna work so
there it is it's on the web and if I

260
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,280
there it is it's on the web and if I
 

261
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,850
there it is it's on the web and if I
right-click on it and go open image and

262
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:56,860
right-click on it and go open image and
 

263
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,790
right-click on it and go open image and
new tab let's click on that and there's

264
00:05:59,790 --> 00:05:59,800
new tab let's click on that and there's
 

265
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,610
new tab let's click on that and there's
my image wow that's really really tiny I

266
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:02,620
my image wow that's really really tiny I
 

267
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,500
my image wow that's really really tiny I
don't know how well that's gonna scale

268
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,510
don't know how well that's gonna scale
 

269
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,379
don't know how well that's gonna scale
you probably you know that makes me

270
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:07,389
you probably you know that makes me
 

271
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,830
you probably you know that makes me
think about the initial quality control

272
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:10,840
think about the initial quality control
 

273
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,839
think about the initial quality control
as we're doing this we want to try to

274
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:12,849
as we're doing this we want to try to
 

275
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:15,960
as we're doing this we want to try to
get the biggest image we can we want to

276
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:15,970
get the biggest image we can we want to
 

277
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,210
get the biggest image we can we want to
try to get it as something that has an

278
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:18,220
try to get it as something that has an
 

279
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,760
try to get it as something that has an
alpha layer like a pin for example that

280
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:20,770
alpha layer like a pin for example that
 

281
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,100
alpha layer like a pin for example that
would be perfect and we want to make

282
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,110
would be perfect and we want to make
 

283
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,380
would be perfect and we want to make
sure that it's as clear as possible if

284
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:25,390
sure that it's as clear as possible if
 

285
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,250
sure that it's as clear as possible if
it's got did there

286
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:26,260
it's got did there
 

287
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,400
it's got did there
or a drop shadow behind it it's not

288
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,410
or a drop shadow behind it it's not
 

289
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,910
or a drop shadow behind it it's not
going to render well as a vector because

290
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:32,920
going to render well as a vector because
 

291
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,580
going to render well as a vector because
vectors are completely different than a

292
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,590
vectors are completely different than a
 

293
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,370
vectors are completely different than a
raster image they're not colorized but

294
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:38,380
raster image they're not colorized but
 

295
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,670
raster image they're not colorized but
they can be colorized on the like when

296
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
they can be colorized on the like when
 

297
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,830
they can be colorized on the like when
you display them so you can say okay

298
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
you display them so you can say okay
 

299
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,420
you display them so you can say okay
well that part is going to be this

300
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,430
well that part is going to be this
 

301
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,920
well that part is going to be this
Pantone and that part is going to be

302
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:46,930
Pantone and that part is going to be
 

303
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,260
Pantone and that part is going to be
this Pantone but it's a lot different

304
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,270
this Pantone but it's a lot different
 

305
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,030
this Pantone but it's a lot different
because it's not saving it as the same

306
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,040
because it's not saving it as the same
 

307
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,840
because it's not saving it as the same
raster

308
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:51,850
raster
 

309
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,540
raster
image so what I might want to do with my

310
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:54,550
image so what I might want to do with my

there on my screen is I might want to do

314
00:06:59,970 --> 00:06:59,980
there on my screen is I might want to do
 

315

shadowing going and I could probably go

320
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:06,520
shadowing going and I could probably go
 

321
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,830
shadowing going and I could probably go
to wiki dot category-five dot TV and on

322
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:10,840
to wiki dot category-five dot TV and on
 

323
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,210
to wiki dot category-five dot TV and on
my wiki I could find branding and go to

324
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,220
my wiki I could find branding and go to
 

325
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,360
my wiki I could find branding and go to
the category 5 branding and I can grab

326
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,370
the category 5 branding and I can grab
 

327
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,080
the category 5 branding and I can grab
one of these full-scale images so maybe

328
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,090
one of these full-scale images so maybe
 

329
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,880
one of these full-scale images so maybe
something a little more like this would

330
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:23,890
something a little more like this would
 

331
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,220
something a little more like this would
be to my liking so at the bottom here

332

I've got a word mark file and you can do

334
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:29,380
I've got a word mark file and you can do
 

335
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,560
I've got a word mark file and you can do
that by you know even just getting on to

336
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:31,570
that by you know even just getting on to
 

337
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,110
that by you know even just getting on to
Google Images or something and finding a

338
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,120
Google Images or something and finding a
 

339
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,390
Google Images or something and finding a
larger image for the images that you're

340
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
larger image for the images that you're
 

341
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,670
larger image for the images that you're

looking for so something like that will
 

343
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,930
looking for so something like that will
look pretty good but notice that this is

344
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:39,940
look pretty good but notice that this is
 

345
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,540
look pretty good but notice that this is
actually a ping file yeah it scales well

346
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,550
actually a ping file yeah it scales well
 

347
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,930
actually a ping file yeah it scales well
but it's a ping so let's save it I'm

348
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:45,940
but it's a ping so let's save it I'm
 

349
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,640
but it's a ping so let's save it I'm
going to throw that on my desktop and

350
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:47,650
going to throw that on my desktop and
 

351
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,310
going to throw that on my desktop and
it's called word mark underscore light

352
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:50,320
it's called word mark underscore light
 

353
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,160
it's called word mark underscore light
dot ping so you can see it right there

354
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,170
dot ping so you can see it right there
 

355
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,490
dot ping so you can see it right there
so there it is so it's a raster image

356
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:56,500
so there it is so it's a raster image

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,410
Advanced Options we can see 16-bit
24-bit and 32-bit the default is 32-bit

462
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:18,420
24-bit and 32-bit the default is 32-bit
 

463
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,130
24-bit and 32-bit the default is 32-bit
a RGB that stands for alpha red green

464
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,140
a RGB that stands for alpha red green
 

465
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,890
a RGB that stands for alpha red green
blue now we do want RGB but we

466
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:25,900
blue now we do want RGB but we
 

467
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,520
blue now we do want RGB but we
do not want 32-bit because PO Trace is

468
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,530
do not want 32-bit because PO Trace is
 

469
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,900
do not want 32-bit because PO Trace is
probably gonna have problems with that

470
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:30,910
probably gonna have problems with that
 

471
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,360
probably gonna have problems with that
instead we're gonna go with 24-bit RGB

472
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,370
instead we're gonna go with 24-bit RGB
 

473
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,700
instead we're gonna go with 24-bit RGB
so I'm going to click on that and now

474
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:35,710
so I'm going to click on that and now
 

475
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,910
so I'm going to click on that and now
RGB 24-bit is selected and i'm gonna

476
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:38,920
RGB 24-bit is selected and i'm gonna
 

477
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,690
RGB 24-bit is selected and i'm gonna
click export so now on my desktop i

478
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:42,700
click export so now on my desktop i
 

479
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,060
click export so now on my desktop i
should have another file here called

480
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,070
should have another file here called
 

481
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,390
should have another file here called
word mark light BMP and when i

482
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:48,400
word mark light BMP and when i
 

483
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,240
word mark light BMP and when i
double-click on that it is my logo look

484
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,250
double-click on that it is my logo look
 

485
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,720
double-click on that it is my logo look
at that

486
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:51,730
at that
 

487
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,110
at that
it's still a raster image if i if i

488
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
it's still a raster image if i if i
 

489
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,780
it's still a raster image if i if i
scale that too much i'm gonna start

490
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:57,790
scale that too much i'm gonna start
 

491
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,730
scale that too much i'm gonna start
losing quality i wonder if i can

492
00:10:59,730 --> 00:10:59,740
losing quality i wonder if i can
 

493
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,130
losing quality i wonder if i can
actually show you that you can see that

494
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,140
actually show you that you can see that
 

495
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,880
actually show you that you can see that
if i zoom way in do you see those

496
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:05,890
if i zoom way in do you see those
 

497
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,060
if i zoom way in do you see those
pixelated edges see how grainy that is

498
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,070
pixelated edges see how grainy that is
 

499
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,910
pixelated edges see how grainy that is
and how blocky that is that's a raster

500
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
and how blocky that is that's a raster
 

501
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,800
and how blocky that is that's a raster
image because it saved each and every

502
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:13,810
image because it saved each and every
 

503
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,340
image because it saved each and every
pixel so instead we're going to create a

504
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,350
pixel so instead we're going to create a
 

505
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,740
pixel so instead we're going to create a
vector based on that file remember the

506
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:19,750
vector based on that file remember the
 

507
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,600
vector based on that file remember the
first step is that I do need that bitmap

508
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:21,610
first step is that I do need that bitmap
 

509
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,450
first step is that I do need that bitmap
file so whether it's a ping source or a

510
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:24,460
file so whether it's a ping source or a
 

511
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,940
file so whether it's a ping source or a
JPEG or whatever it happens to be you

512
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:26,950
JPEG or whatever it happens to be you
 

513
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,890
JPEG or whatever it happens to be you
need to convert it first to a bitmap and

514
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:28,900
need to convert it first to a bitmap and
 

515
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,810
need to convert it first to a bitmap and
then Poe trace will be able to work with

516
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:30,820
then Poe trace will be able to work with
 

517
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,840
then Poe trace will be able to work with
it so now I'm going to type Poe trace

518
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:32,850
it so now I'm going to type Poe trace
 

519
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,400
it so now I'm going to type Poe trace
and there's a couple of things now you

520
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,410
and there's a couple of things now you
 

521
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,400
and there's a couple of things now you
can do - - help to learn more see how

522
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,410
can do - - help to learn more see how
 

523
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,560
can do - - help to learn more see how
this works and what you want to do you

524
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,570
this works and what you want to do you
 

525
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,390
this works and what you want to do you
can kind of scroll up here and see what

526
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:42,400
can kind of scroll up here and see what
 

527
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,610
can kind of scroll up here and see what
kind of options are available to you but

528
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:44,620
kind of options are available to you but
 

529
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,470
kind of options are available to you but
I'm gonna tell you what I think is gonna

530
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm gonna tell you what I think is gonna
 

531
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,450
I'm gonna tell you what I think is gonna
work just fine for us and we'll see here

532
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:48,460
work just fine for us and we'll see here
 

533
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,520
work just fine for us and we'll see here
live on the air if this is gonna work

534
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,530
live on the air if this is gonna work
 

535
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,300
live on the air if this is gonna work
I'm gonna do - s which means I'm gonna

536
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,310
I'm gonna do - s which means I'm gonna
 

537
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,320
I'm gonna do - s which means I'm gonna
save this as an SVG vector image then

538
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,330
save this as an SVG vector image then
 

539
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,190
save this as an SVG vector image then
I'm gonna say - group and - group is of

540
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm gonna say - group and - group is of
 

541
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,310
I'm gonna say - group and - group is of
is an SVG option and what that does is

542
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:05,320
is an SVG option and what that does is
 

543
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,640
is an SVG option and what that does is
it groups related paths together so it's

544
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:08,650
it groups related paths together so it's
 

545
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,380
it groups related paths together so it's
gonna merge all those into a single

546
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,390
gonna merge all those into a single
 

547
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,460
gonna merge all those into a single
basically a vector like traversal point

548
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:17,470
basically a vector like traversal point
 

549
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,410
basically a vector like traversal point
I don't know the technical terms but

550
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:19,420
I don't know the technical terms but
 

551
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,750
I don't know the technical terms but
rather than having a whole bunch of

552
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
rather than having a whole bunch of
 

553
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,730
rather than having a whole bunch of
separate things in your SVG file it's

554
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:23,740
separate things in your SVG file it's
 

555
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,590
separate things in your SVG file it's
gonna merge those together so let's

556
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
gonna merge those together so let's
 

557
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,000
gonna merge those together so let's
group those together keep things nice

558
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,010
group those together keep things nice
 

559
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,590
group those together keep things nice
and clean now I want to tell it my

560
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:28,600
and clean now I want to tell it my
 

561
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,710
and clean now I want to tell it my
output I'm gonna call this logo dot SVG

562
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:31,720
output I'm gonna call this logo dot SVG
 

563
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,060
output I'm gonna call this logo dot SVG
SVG being a scalable vector format and

564
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,070
SVG being a scalable vector format and
 

565
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,340
SVG being a scalable vector format and
then the next thing that

566
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,350
then the next thing that
 

567
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,320
then the next thing that
can do this is optional but I'm gonna do

568
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,330
can do this is optional but I'm gonna do
 

569
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,150
can do this is optional but I'm gonna do
- - tight and what - - tight does is it

570
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,160
- - tight and what - - tight does is it
 

571
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,400
- - tight and what - - tight does is it
if there's a lot of white space around

572
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,410
if there's a lot of white space around
 

573
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,320
if there's a lot of white space around
your logo that you're working with it's

574
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,330
your logo that you're working with it's
 

575
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,610
your logo that you're working with it's
gonna bring that in it's gonna basically

576
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:50,620
gonna bring that in it's gonna basically
 

577
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,430
gonna bring that in it's gonna basically
auto crop that vector for you so that

578
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
auto crop that vector for you so that
 

579
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,630
auto crop that vector for you so that
you don't have a bunch of white space

580
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:54,640
you don't have a bunch of white space
 

581
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,820
you don't have a bunch of white space
from a vector perspective I think that's

582
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:56,830
from a vector perspective I think that's
 

583
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,540
from a vector perspective I think that's
a good idea and then the next thing is

584
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:00,550
a good idea and then the next thing is
 

585
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,360
a good idea and then the next thing is
my input file so that file was called

586
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,370
my input file so that file was called
 

587
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,640
my input file so that file was called
word mark light dot BMP now I'm just

588
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:08,650
word mark light dot BMP now I'm just
 

589
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,830
word mark light dot BMP now I'm just
gonna hit enter and as soon as I hit

590
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:10,840
gonna hit enter and as soon as I hit
 

591
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,560
gonna hit enter and as soon as I hit
enter if everything Oh what did I do

592
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,570
enter if everything Oh what did I do
 

593
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,130
enter if everything Oh what did I do
it says PO trace invalid option - - zero

594
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,140
it says PO trace invalid option - - zero
 

595
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,000
it says PO trace invalid option - - zero
oh why did I push zero that was supposed

596
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,010
oh why did I push zero that was supposed
 

597
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,110
oh why did I push zero that was supposed
to be an O for output there you go so

598
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
to be an O for output there you go so
 

599
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,780
to be an O for output there you go so
remember - oh not - the arrow enter and

600
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:27,790
remember - oh not - the arrow enter and
 

601
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,970
remember - oh not - the arrow enter and
did you see how quickly that popped up a

602
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:29,980
did you see how quickly that popped up a
 

603
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,060
did you see how quickly that popped up a
logo dot SVG file on my desktop so if I

604
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,070
logo dot SVG file on my desktop so if I
 

605
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,280
logo dot SVG file on my desktop so if I
double click on that file now you can

606
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,290
double click on that file now you can
 

607
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,740
double click on that file now you can
see category five and it's stripped away

608
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:37,750
see category five and it's stripped away
 

609
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,980
see category five and it's stripped away
the green so that's a problem for me but

610
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:40,990
the green so that's a problem for me but
 

611
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,340
the green so that's a problem for me but
this is in fact a vector so why did it

612
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,350
this is in fact a vector so why did it
 

613
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,890
this is in fact a vector so why did it
strip away the green well it's grayscale

614
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:46,900
strip away the green well it's grayscale
 

615
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,310
strip away the green well it's grayscale
right so maybe I can work with that I

616
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
right so maybe I can work with that I
 

617
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,870
right so maybe I can work with that I
can look at the options that are

618
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:51,880
can look at the options that are
 

619
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,850
can look at the options that are
available to me let's see if gray

620
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:53,860
available to me let's see if gray
 

621
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,800
available to me let's see if gray
scaling it would do some kind of

622
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:55,810
scaling it would do some kind of
 

623
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,140
scaling it would do some kind of
difference so looking at our output

624
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,150
difference so looking at our output
 

625
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,220
difference so looking at our output
options here let's get a closer look and

626
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,230
options here let's get a closer look and
 

627
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,930
options here let's get a closer look and
see what kind of options we have as far

628
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:03,940
see what kind of options we have as far
 

629
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,900
see what kind of options we have as far
as the colorization goes we've got

630
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:08,910
as the colorization goes we've got
 

631
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,090
as the colorization goes we've got
resolution scale stretch rotate margin

632
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,100
resolution scale stretch rotate margin
 

633
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,460
resolution scale stretch rotate margin
left margin bottom margin page size all

634
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,470
left margin bottom margin page size all
 

635
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,070
left margin bottom margin page size all
these things Oh - color set foreground

636
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,080
these things Oh - color set foreground
 

637
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,110
these things Oh - color set foreground
color fill color opaque but if you're if

638
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,120
color fill color opaque but if you're if
 

639
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,830
color fill color opaque but if you're if
you're not sure there are ways to do it

640
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:25,840
you're not sure there are ways to do it
 

641
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,250
you're not sure there are ways to do it
there are ways to have it dither for you

642
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,260
there are ways to have it dither for you
 

643
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,240
there are ways to have it dither for you
but there's something that we can do

644
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,250
but there's something that we can do
 

645
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,250
but there's something that we can do
here so remember we created that bitmap

646
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,260
here so remember we created that bitmap
 

647
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,780
here so remember we created that bitmap
ourselves right and remember that what a

648
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:35,790
ourselves right and remember that what a
 

649
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,560
ourselves right and remember that what a
victor is is basically the outlines of

650
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:40,570
victor is is basically the outlines of
 

651
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,680
victor is is basically the outlines of
this file so let's export that again

652
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:43,690
this file so let's export that again
 

653
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,160
this file so let's export that again
let's create a new export before we do

654
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,170
let's create a new export before we do
 

655
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,960
let's create a new export before we do
that I'm gonna go image mode grayscale

656
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:51,970
that I'm gonna go image mode grayscale
 

657
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,090
that I'm gonna go image mode grayscale
and then image mode RGB again so I've

658
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,100
and then image mode RGB again so I've
 

659
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,740
and then image mode RGB again so I've
just gray scaled it let's see if that's

660
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:58,750
just gray scaled it let's see if that's
 

661
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,790
just gray scaled it let's see if that's
gonna do it for us

662
00:14:59,790 --> 00:14:59,800
gonna do it for us
 

663
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,410
gonna do it for us
there's still a lot of white there I'm

664
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:04,420
there's still a lot of white there I'm
 

665
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,600
there's still a lot of white there I'm
gonna overwrite that file set the same

666
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,610
gonna overwrite that file set the same
 

667
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,189
gonna overwrite that file set the same
settings I want to be 24-bit and export

668
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
settings I want to be 24-bit and export
 

669
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,319
settings I want to be 24-bit and export
that all right I'm just gonna minimize

670
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:13,329
that all right I'm just gonna minimize
 

671
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,379
that all right I'm just gonna minimize
that and see what happens here so let's

672
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:15,389
that and see what happens here so let's
 

673
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,660
that and see what happens here so let's
poet race that again and see if that's

674
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:18,670
poet race that again and see if that's
 

675
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,290
poet race that again and see if that's
made any difference and it hasn't so our

676
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:21,300
made any difference and it hasn't so our
 

677
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,210
made any difference and it hasn't so our
color is causing a problem with this

678
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:24,220
color is causing a problem with this
 

679
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,710
color is causing a problem with this
particular vector because it's trying to

680
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:25,720
particular vector because it's trying to
 

681
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,840
particular vector because it's trying to
get those edges and it's seen the black

682
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:27,850
get those edges and it's seen the black
 

683
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,490
get those edges and it's seen the black
but it's not seeing the green so how can

684
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:29,500
but it's not seeing the green so how can
 

685
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,800
but it's not seeing the green so how can
I fix that and it's not seeing the white

686
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:31,810
I fix that and it's not seeing the white
 

687
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,540
I fix that and it's not seeing the white
either it's seen that as like a

688
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:33,550
either it's seen that as like a
 

689
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,749
either it's seen that as like a
background color so back in the GNU

690
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:36,759
background color so back in the GNU
 

691
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,800
background color so back in the GNU
image manipulation program I can turn on

692
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:39,810
image manipulation program I can turn on
 

693
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,960
image manipulation program I can turn on
alpha hold so this is locked the Alpha

694
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:42,970
alpha hold so this is locked the Alpha
 

695
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,309
alpha hold so this is locked the Alpha
Channel and then choose black and right

696
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:47,319
Channel and then choose black and right
 

697
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,980
Channel and then choose black and right
click and go edit fill with foreground

698
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:49,990
click and go edit fill with foreground
 

699
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,559
click and go edit fill with foreground
color and so I've created that as a

700
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:51,569
color and so I've created that as a
 

701
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:54,569
color and so I've created that as a
completely black image now I can go file

702
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:54,579
completely black image now I can go file
 

703
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,530
completely black image now I can go file
export as word mark light dot BMP export

704
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:58,540
export as word mark light dot BMP export
 

705
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,900
export as word mark light dot BMP export
and replace set my settings and export

706
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:03,910
and replace set my settings and export
 

707
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,869
and replace set my settings and export
so now I've got an image that's a bitmap

708
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:06,879
so now I've got an image that's a bitmap
 

709
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,129
so now I've got an image that's a bitmap
that is all black so now if I run that

710
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:11,139
that is all black so now if I run that
 

711
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,670
that is all black so now if I run that
command again you don't have to be

712
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:14,680
command again you don't have to be
 

713
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,790
command again you don't have to be
afraid to experiment and try things out

714
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
afraid to experiment and try things out
 

715
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,769
afraid to experiment and try things out
that is the actual vector so this is the

716
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:19,779
that is the actual vector so this is the
 

717
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,249
that is the actual vector so this is the
logo SVG this is the logo dot BMP so

718
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:23,259
logo SVG this is the logo dot BMP so
 

719
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:24,569
logo SVG this is the logo dot BMP so
with the logo dot BMP

720
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:24,579
with the logo dot BMP
 

721
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,850
with the logo dot BMP
I'm gonna hit 1 and then I'm gonna hit +

722
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:26,860
I'm gonna hit 1 and then I'm gonna hit +
 

723
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:34,710
I'm gonna hit 1 and then I'm gonna hit +
1 - can i zoom in one - ctrl + 1 2 3 4 5

724
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
1 - can i zoom in one - ctrl + 1 2 3 4 5
 

725
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,569
1 - can i zoom in one - ctrl + 1 2 3 4 5
and then I'm going to hit I'm going to

726
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:36,579
and then I'm going to hit I'm going to
 

727
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,879
and then I'm going to hit I'm going to
come over here so this is the bitmap you

728
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:38,889
come over here so this is the bitmap you
 

729
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,249
come over here so this is the bitmap you
see those edges how can i awful those

730
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:41,259
see those edges how can i awful those
 

731
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,590
see those edges how can i awful those
are 1 2 3 4 5 see that jagged edges

732
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:46,600
are 1 2 3 4 5 see that jagged edges
 

733
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,230
are 1 2 3 4 5 see that jagged edges
right so let's do the same thing let's

734
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,240
right so let's do the same thing let's
 

735
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,230
right so let's do the same thing let's
go back to our SVG file that we've

736
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
go back to our SVG file that we've
 

737
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,100
go back to our SVG file that we've
output

738
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,110
output
 

739
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,650
output
and let's zoom into that and let's go

740
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:56,660
and let's zoom into that and let's go
 

741
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,800
and let's zoom into that and let's go
zoom in a whole bunch of times and move

742
00:16:59,800 --> 00:16:59,810
zoom in a whole bunch of times and move
 

743
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,110
zoom in a whole bunch of times and move
over here notice the background has gone

744
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,120
over here notice the background has gone
 

745
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,930
over here notice the background has gone
to see how clean that edges because now

746
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:04,940
to see how clean that edges because now
 

747
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,820
to see how clean that edges because now
we're working with a vector file I've

748
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:06,830
we're working with a vector file I've
 

749
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,670
we're working with a vector file I've
zoomed in a hundred fifteen hundred

750
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:09,680
zoomed in a hundred fifteen hundred
 

751
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,920
zoomed in a hundred fifteen hundred
times and you can and it's really really

752
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:11,930
times and you can and it's really really
 

753
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,040
times and you can and it's really really
hard to scroll because I'm scaled in so

754
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,050
hard to scroll because I'm scaled in so
 

755
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,490
hard to scroll because I'm scaled in so
close but now okay I'm zoomed in two

756
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:18,500
close but now okay I'm zoomed in two
 

757
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,350
close but now okay I'm zoomed in two
thousand times which is the absolute

758
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:20,360
thousand times which is the absolute
 

759
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,960
thousand times which is the absolute
maximum and you can see that that edge

760
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:22,970
maximum and you can see that that edge
 

761
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,600
maximum and you can see that that edge
has absolutely no jagged edges

762
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:25,610
has absolutely no jagged edges
 

763
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,120
has absolutely no jagged edges
whatsoever so I can scale that up too no

764
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,130
whatsoever so I can scale that up too no
 

765
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,450
whatsoever so I can scale that up too no
matter what I want it to be and it's not

766
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:31,460
matter what I want it to be and it's not
 

767
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,340
matter what I want it to be and it's not
going to be jagged edge if I open that

768
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,350
going to be jagged edge if I open that
 

769
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,140
going to be jagged edge if I open that
with the GNU image manipulation program

770
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,150
with the GNU image manipulation program
 

771
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,900
with the GNU image manipulation program
now it's an SVG file so what is it

772
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:37,910
now it's an SVG file so what is it
 

773
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,690
now it's an SVG file so what is it
saying hey this is a render scalable

774
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:40,700
saying hey this is a render scalable
 

775
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,810
saying hey this is a render scalable
vector graphic this is the width and

776
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:43,820
vector graphic this is the width and
 

777
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,660
vector graphic this is the width and
height and what do you want to do well

778
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:46,670
height and what do you want to do well
 

779
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,670
height and what do you want to do well
let's make it a ridiculous amount let's

780
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:48,680
let's make it a ridiculous amount let's
 

781
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,810
let's make it a ridiculous amount let's
make it thirty thousand pixels wide you

782
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:52,820
make it thirty thousand pixels wide you
 

783
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,310
make it thirty thousand pixels wide you
think this is gonna crash my computer

784
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
think this is gonna crash my computer
 

785
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,620
think this is gonna crash my computer
let's hit OK it might crash my computer

786
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:58,630
let's hit OK it might crash my computer
 

787
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,950
let's hit OK it might crash my computer
that's ridiculously high res there we go

788
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
that's ridiculously high res there we go
 

789
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,910
that's ridiculously high res there we go
I'm gonna view it at one times and look

790
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm gonna view it at one times and look
 

791
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,090
I'm gonna view it at one times and look
at that see those edges that is actually

792
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,100
at that see those edges that is actually
 

793
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,910
at that see those edges that is actually
one of the letters in our logo they're

794
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:12,920
one of the letters in our logo they're
 

795
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,300
one of the letters in our logo they're
absolutely perfect no jagged edge

796
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:16,310
absolutely perfect no jagged edge
 

797
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,970
absolutely perfect no jagged edge
because this is legitimately a vector

798
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:18,980
because this is legitimately a vector
 

799
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,340
because this is legitimately a vector
and I mentioned there that some of these

800
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,350
and I mentioned there that some of these
 

801
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,430
and I mentioned there that some of these
online tools that do this for free are

802
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
online tools that do this for free are
 

803
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,960
online tools that do this for free are
gonna cause you to have like a

804
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:25,970
gonna cause you to have like a
 

805
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,780
gonna cause you to have like a
rasterized image within a vector that's

806
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:28,790
rasterized image within a vector that's
 

807
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,310
rasterized image within a vector that's
not gonna scale up like that

808
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
not gonna scale up like that
 

809
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,200
not gonna scale up like that
so let's actually see how we can

810
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,210
so let's actually see how we can
 

811
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,510
so let's actually see how we can
determine that so if i open with and

812
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:34,520
determine that so if i open with and
 

813
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,850
determine that so if i open with and
let's actually open our SVG file with a

814
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:36,860
let's actually open our SVG file with a
 

815
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,530
let's actually open our SVG file with a
text editor and i can see that those SVG

816
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:41,540
text editor and i can see that those SVG
 

817
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,240
text editor and i can see that those SVG
paths have been traced by PO trace so

818
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,250
paths have been traced by PO trace so
 

819
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,970
paths have been traced by PO trace so
these are actually the paths of the

820
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:48,980
these are actually the paths of the
 

821
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,420
these are actually the paths of the
vector now what you'll see if it's not

822
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:52,430
vector now what you'll see if it's not
 

823
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,390
vector now what you'll see if it's not
vector if it's just like a fake vector

824
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:55,400
vector if it's just like a fake vector
 

825
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,980
vector if it's just like a fake vector
is that you'll see that it has like an

826
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:56,990
is that you'll see that it has like an
 

827
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,180
is that you'll see that it has like an
embed with like some pain data well this

828
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,190
embed with like some pain data well this
 

829
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,270
embed with like some pain data well this
is a true vector so there you have it

830
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:04,280
is a true vector so there you have it
 

831
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,880
is a true vector so there you have it
and I mentioned about this IKEA logo so

832
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:06,890
and I mentioned about this IKEA logo so
 

833
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,260
and I mentioned about this IKEA logo so
let's actually see what happens here

834
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,270
let's actually see what happens here
 

835
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,120
let's actually see what happens here
with the IKEA logo because I want to see

836
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,130
with the IKEA logo because I want to see

I was working on the category 5 logo I
 

865
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,260
I was working on the category 5 logo I
had to switch back to RGB well if I

875
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,840
that it's RGB I can export as a bitmap
so export as change it to BMP and now

876
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:07,850
so export as change it to BMP and now
 

877

now back in my terminal let's try that

894
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,010
now back in my terminal let's try that
 

895
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,410
now back in my terminal let's try that
one so I'm just gonna press the up arrow

896
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:32,420
one so I'm just gonna press the up arrow
 

897
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,800
one so I'm just gonna press the up arrow
on my Linux keyboard and remove the

instead change that to IKEA underscore

902
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:40,940

instantly I see a new IKEA oh no it

906
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,170
instantly I see a new IKEA oh no it
 

907
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,290
instantly I see a new IKEA oh no it
saved as logo SVG because of the - Oh

command let's see what that looks like

910
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:51,890
command let's see what that looks like
 

911
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,890
command let's see what that looks like
tada

912
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:52,900
tada
 

913
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,820
tada
so that's a vector of the IKEA logo well

914
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:56,830
so that's a vector of the IKEA logo well
 

915
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,920
so that's a vector of the IKEA logo well
that's not exactly what I would want

916
00:20:59,920 --> 00:20:59,930
that's not exactly what I would want
 

917
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,350
that's not exactly what I would want
remember vector is not saving the color

918
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:02,360
remember vector is not saving the color
 

919
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,870
remember vector is not saving the color

information it's saving the paths right
 

921
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,010
information it's saving the paths right
the color information is going to be

922
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,020
the color information is going to be
 

923
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,240
the color information is going to be
separate that's something that you're

924
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,250
separate that's something that you're
 

925
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,770
separate that's something that you're
gonna provide to your graphic designer

926
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:08,780
gonna provide to your graphic designer
 

927
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,260
gonna provide to your graphic designer
or maybe your logo doesn't have a whole

928
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,270
or maybe your logo doesn't have a whole
 

929
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,080
or maybe your logo doesn't have a whole
lot but watch this so if I do that

930
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,090
lot but watch this so if I do that
 

931
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,730
lot but watch this so if I do that
command again now I'm going to add to

932
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:15,740
command again now I'm going to add to
 

933
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,990
command again now I'm going to add to
that command I don't know if I can do it

934
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,000
that command I don't know if I can do it
 

935
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,340
that command I don't know if I can do it
at the

936
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,350
at the
 

937
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,430
at the
but I'm gonna type - - invert and now

938
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,440
but I'm gonna type - - invert and now
 

939
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,730
but I'm gonna type - - invert and now
that I've typed - - invert and I open

940
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:23,740
that I've typed - - invert and I open
 

941
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,810
that I've typed - - invert and I open
that image again look at the difference

942
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:24,820
that image again look at the difference
 

943
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,990
that image again look at the difference
its inverted that logo for me and now I

944
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
its inverted that logo for me and now I
 

945
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,390
its inverted that logo for me and now I
have a perfect vector that looks like

946
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
have a perfect vector that looks like
 

947
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,870
have a perfect vector that looks like
that

948
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
that
 

949
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,049
that
so again if I open that in the GNU image

950
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:34,059
so again if I open that in the GNU image
 

951
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,880
so again if I open that in the GNU image
manipulation program and I'm only doing

952
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:35,890
manipulation program and I'm only doing
 

953
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,830
manipulation program and I'm only doing
that because this is a raster program

954
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
that because this is a raster program
 

955
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,880
that because this is a raster program
but I want you to see that this is

956
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:38,890
but I want you to see that this is
 

957
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,090
but I want you to see that this is
indeed a vector image now if I take that

958
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,100
indeed a vector image now if I take that
 

959
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,299
indeed a vector image now if I take that
and I make it fifty thousand pixels wide

960
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:44,309
and I make it fifty thousand pixels wide
 

961
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,440
and I make it fifty thousand pixels wide
eighteen thousand seven hundred eight

962
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,450
eighteen thousand seven hundred eight
 

963
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,549
eighteen thousand seven hundred eight
pixels high it says I don't have enough

964
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
pixels high it says I don't have enough
 

965
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,560
pixels high it says I don't have enough
memory for that let's try a little bit

966
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,570
memory for that let's try a little bit
 

967
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,080
memory for that let's try a little bit
smaller open with GNU image manipulation

968
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,090
smaller open with GNU image manipulation
 

969
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,299
smaller open with GNU image manipulation
program you see it is vector

970
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:57,309
program you see it is vector
 

971
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:01,350
program you see it is vector
let's try ten thousand pixels wide 3742

972
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
let's try ten thousand pixels wide 3742
 

973
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,740
let's try ten thousand pixels wide 3742
pixels high there we go alright hit 1

974
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:04,750
pixels high there we go alright hit 1
 

975
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,090
pixels high there we go alright hit 1
and you can see those edges are flawless

976
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,100
and you can see those edges are flawless
 

977
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,159
and you can see those edges are flawless
well how's the round edge look let's

978
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:11,169
well how's the round edge look let's
 

979
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:15,260
well how's the round edge look let's
jump up look at that my friends

980
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,270
jump up look at that my friends
 

981
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,440
jump up look at that my friends
absolutely beautiful there you have it

982
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,450
absolutely beautiful there you have it
 

983
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,289
absolutely beautiful there you have it
so that is one way that we can actually

984
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:22,299
so that is one way that we can actually
 

985
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,090
so that is one way that we can actually
very very quickly convert a ping to a

986
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,100
very very quickly convert a ping to a
 

987
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,149
very very quickly convert a ping to a
bitmap make sure that it's grayscale or

988
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
bitmap make sure that it's grayscale or
 

989
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,500
bitmap make sure that it's grayscale or
that the colors are going to convert

990
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,510
that the colors are going to convert
 

991
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,840
that the colors are going to convert
properly into a vector and then actually

992
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:33,850
properly into a vector and then actually
 

993
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,180
properly into a vector and then actually
