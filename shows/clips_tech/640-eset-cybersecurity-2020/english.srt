00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,350
latest technology trends and threats are
a really big part of tech because I need

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,700
to you my viewers and and help you to be
ready and prepared for the threats that

00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,710
ready and prepared for the threats that
 

15
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,509
ready and prepared for the threats that
are coming over the horizon here as you

are coming over the horizon here as you
 

17
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,730
are coming over the horizon here as you
know here the first month of January

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:28,740
know here the first month of January
 

19
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,550
know here the first month of January
starts to wrap up the first month of

starts to wrap up the first month of
 

21
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,459
starts to wrap up the first month of
2020 I should say January being that my

January does feel very long though but
 

29
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,670
January does feel very long though but
we're really it does and when we're

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
we're really it does and when we're
 

31
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,799
we're really it does and when we're
seeing an evolution in malware we're

32
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:45,809
seeing an evolution in malware we're
 

33
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,250
seeing an evolution in malware we're
seeing things transition from viruses to

34
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,260
seeing things transition from viruses to
 

35
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,420
seeing things transition from viruses to
malware to ransomware and now even file

36
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,430
malware to ransomware and now even file
 

37
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,970
malware to ransomware and now even file
this attacks we're seeing Hardware

38
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:55,980
this attacks we're seeing Hardware
 

39
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,209
this attacks we're seeing Hardware
attacks and firmware infiltrations and

40
00:00:59,209 --> 00:00:59,219
attacks and firmware infiltrations and
 

41
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,400
attacks and firmware infiltrations and
things that we've never ever even

42
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,410
things that we've never ever even
 

43
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,349
things that we've never ever even
encountered before but those are very

44
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
encountered before but those are very
 

45
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,890
encountered before but those are very
real threats here as we enter 2020 so

46
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:06,900
real threats here as we enter 2020 so
 

47
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,320
real threats here as we enter 2020 so
the opportunity arose and I spent some

48
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,330
the opportunity arose and I spent some
 

49
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,149
the opportunity arose and I spent some
time there I want to jump into an

the for the attack team in Canada and I
 

71
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,190
the for the attack team in Canada and I

sales in general between the Canadian

74
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,049
sales in general between the Canadian
 

75
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,780
sales in general between the Canadian
territory so a very technical mind

76
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:41,790
territory so a very technical mind
 

77
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,760
territory so a very technical mind
you're very familiar with the inner

78
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:43,770
you're very familiar with the inner
 

79
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,770
you're very familiar with the inner
workings of the products yep I'm doing

80
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:45,780
workings of the products yep I'm doing
 

81
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,990
workings of the products yep I'm doing
that has all the geeky talk with the

82
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
that has all the geeky talk with the
 

83
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,539
that has all the geeky talk with the
other text and other customers yeah and

84
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:50,549
other text and other customers yeah and
 

85
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,060
other text and other customers yeah and
the main driver for that is to be able

86
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,070
the main driver for that is to be able
 

87
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,249
the main driver for that is to be able
to technically position the products and

88
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:55,259
to technically position the products and
 

89
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,959
to technically position the products and
see if we can address all the customer

90
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:56,969
see if we can address all the customer
 

91
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:57,469
see if we can address all the customer
requirements

92
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:57,479
requirements
 

93
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,100
requirements
sure so part of that comes from

94
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,110
sure so part of that comes from
 

95
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,950
sure so part of that comes from
educating end-users to understand what

96
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:03,960
educating end-users to understand what
 

97
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,300
educating end-users to understand what
the cyber security threat landscape

98
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,310
the cyber security threat landscape
 

99
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,280
the cyber security threat landscape
looks like absolutely yeah and we've

100
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,290
looks like absolutely yeah and we've
 

101
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,960
looks like absolutely yeah and we've
really really seen that change over the

102
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:08,970
really really seen that change over the
 

103
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,089
really really seen that change over the
past couple of years I think especially

104
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:10,099
past couple of years I think especially
 

105
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,280
past couple of years I think especially
was it

106
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,290
was it
 

107
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,470
was it
2017 when wanna cry dropped yes this is

108
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:15,480
2017 when wanna cry dropped yes this is
 

109
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,500
2017 when wanna cry dropped yes this is
like the first ransomware that really

110
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,510
like the first ransomware that really
 

111
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,180
like the first ransomware that really
made its way around the world and was

112
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,190
made its way around the world and was
 

113
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,630
made its way around the world and was
really really huge how did that impact

114
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:23,640
really really huge how did that impact
 

115
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,610
really really huge how did that impact
the direction of a kind like you said we

116
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,620
the direction of a kind like you said we
 

117
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,370
the direction of a kind like you said we
should not see any any numbers going

118
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,380
should not see any any numbers going
 

119
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,140
should not see any any numbers going
down whenever it comes to the ransomware

120
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,150
down whenever it comes to the ransomware
 

121
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,320
down whenever it comes to the ransomware
it's still the the really prevalent and

122
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,330
it's still the the really prevalent and
 

123
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,690
it's still the the really prevalent and
and everybody in a way is kind of

124
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:35,700
and everybody in a way is kind of
 

125
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,990
and everybody in a way is kind of
experiencing it we do have a pretty good

126
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
experiencing it we do have a pretty good
 

127
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,720
experiencing it we do have a pretty good
protection against it so I I don't

128
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:41,730
protection against it so I I don't
 

129
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,180
protection against it so I I don't
expect my existing customers that are

130
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,190
expect my existing customers that are
 

131
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,800
expect my existing customers that are
running updated products and everything

132
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:45,810
running updated products and everything
 

133
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,610
running updated products and everything
from being acted to those threats but

134
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,620
from being acted to those threats but
 

135
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,729
from being acted to those threats but
it's something that's already very very

136
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:51,739
it's something that's already very very
 

137
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,830
it's something that's already very very
live very very present in our day-to-day

138
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,840
live very very present in our day-to-day
 

139
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,890
live very very present in our day-to-day
operations something else that right

140
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:57,900
operations something else that right
 

141
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,229
operations something else that right
that I usually highlight on the on the

142
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
that I usually highlight on the on the
 

143
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,479
that I usually highlight on the on the
threat landscape that we have recently

144
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:02,489
threat landscape that we have recently
 

145
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,770
threat landscape that we have recently
is the upcoming releases of the file as

146
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:06,780
is the upcoming releases of the file as
 

147
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,310
is the upcoming releases of the file as
malware so if you have for example an

148
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,320
malware so if you have for example an
 

149
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,979
malware so if you have for example an
endpoint security product that's running

150
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:12,989
endpoint security product that's running
 

151
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,420
endpoint security product that's running
on your computer either an AV

152
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:14,430
on your computer either an AV
 

153
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,850
on your computer either an AV
anti-malware or whichever name you

154
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:16,860
anti-malware or whichever name you
 

155
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,770
anti-malware or whichever name you
prefer to call it yeah I still have the

156
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:21,780
prefer to call it yeah I still have the
 

157
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,830
prefer to call it yeah I still have the
need to scan files so however the idea

158
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:24,840
need to scan files so however the idea
 

159
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,410
need to scan files so however the idea
of a file as malware is there's no files

160
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,420
of a file as malware is there's no files
 

161
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,320
of a file as malware is there's no files
okay so how do you scan something if

162
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,330
okay so how do you scan something if
 

163
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,020
okay so how do you scan something if
it's it's not available in a computer so

164
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,030
it's it's not available in a computer so
 

165
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,390
it's it's not available in a computer so
those those malware's are in general

166
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,400
those those malware's are in general
 

167
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,449
those those malware's are in general
being running by scripts on draw

168
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:38,459
being running by scripts on draw
 

169
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,319
being running by scripts on draw
webpages malicious web pages right and

170
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,329
webpages malicious web pages right and
 

171
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,699
webpages malicious web pages right and
the most common one today is probably

172
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:43,709
the most common one today is probably
 

173
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,250
the most common one today is probably
the quaint miners so it's a script that

174
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,260
the quaint miners so it's a script that
 

175
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,710
the quaint miners so it's a script that
we run on a given computer and that

176
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
we run on a given computer and that
 

177
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,560
we run on a given computer and that
computer will start mining bitcoins for

178
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,570
computer will start mining bitcoins for
 

179
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,100
computer will start mining bitcoins for
the for the motors so you call these

180
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,110
the for the motors so you call these
 

181
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,710
the for the motors so you call these
file lists malware so does that mean

182
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,720
file lists malware so does that mean
 

183
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,110
file lists malware so does that mean
that it just loads right into RAM from a

184
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,120
that it just loads right into RAM from a
 

185
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,509
that it just loads right into RAM from a
website yes it will actually be it it

186
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:02,519
website yes it will actually be it it
 

187
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,310
website yes it will actually be it it
will be a script that will be running in

188
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,320
will be a script that will be running in
 

189
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,500
will be a script that will be running in
memory whenever you go to those websites

190
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:06,510
memory whenever you go to those websites
 

191
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,770
memory whenever you go to those websites
and if your existing endpoint security

192
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:09,780
and if your existing endpoint security
 

193
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,410
and if your existing endpoint security
product cannot scan or cannot protect

194
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:12,420
product cannot scan or cannot protect
 

195
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,259
product cannot scan or cannot protect
your memory in real time you will be

196
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:15,269
your memory in real time you will be
 

197
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,390
your memory in real time you will be
subset susceptible to that kind of

00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,400
subset susceptible to that kind of
 

199
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,050
subset susceptible to that kind of
threat

200
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,060
threat
 

201
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,580
threat
in general so sounds to me like another

202
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:19,590
in general so sounds to me like another
 

203
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,310
in general so sounds to me like another
like

204
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
like
 

205
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,140
like
wanna cry as the first kind of example

206
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,150
wanna cry as the first kind of example
 

207
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,020
wanna cry as the first kind of example
of ransomware another threat where basic

208
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,030
of ransomware another threat where basic
 

209
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,750
of ransomware another threat where basic
like antivirus and use the absolutely

210
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:27,760
like antivirus and use the absolutely
 

211
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,420
like antivirus and use the absolutely
virus because here anti-malware is a

212
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,430
virus because here anti-malware is a
 

213
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,460
virus because here anti-malware is a
term that we in the industry use these

214
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,470
term that we in the industry use these
 

215
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,740
term that we in the industry use these
days because really it's not just

216
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:34,750
days because really it's not just
 

217
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,450
days because really it's not just
viruses that we are dealing with those

218
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:36,460
viruses that we are dealing with those
 

219
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,290
viruses that we are dealing with those
threats anymore so so is antivirus is it

220
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:40,300
threats anymore so so is antivirus is it
 

221
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,560
threats anymore so so is antivirus is it
sufficient anymore I don't I don't

222
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:43,570
sufficient anymore I don't I don't
 

223
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,540
sufficient anymore I don't I don't
believe in C virus has been sufficient

224
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,550
believe in C virus has been sufficient
 

225
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,060
believe in C virus has been sufficient
for a long time so not only we have the

226
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,070
for a long time so not only we have the
 

227
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,180
for a long time so not only we have the
viruses out there we have those files as

228
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,190
viruses out there we have those files as
 

229
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,380
viruses out there we have those files as
malware's we have the crypto actors in

230
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,390
malware's we have the crypto actors in
 

231
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,060
malware's we have the crypto actors in
general the ransom layers we have

232
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,070
general the ransom layers we have
 

233
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,820
general the ransom layers we have
Trojans we have back doors we have

234
00:04:59,820 --> 00:04:59,830
Trojans we have back doors we have
 

235
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,850
Trojans we have back doors we have
exploits so in general is antivirus

236
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:02,860
exploits so in general is antivirus
 

237
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,090
exploits so in general is antivirus
enough you know is it better than not

238
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,100
enough you know is it better than not
 

239
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,430
enough you know is it better than not
having anything yes sir but if you have

240
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:08,440
having anything yes sir but if you have
 

241
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,500
having anything yes sir but if you have
the option and yes you do have the

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:10,510
the option and yes you do have the
 

243
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,940
the option and yes you do have the
options sometimes we're talking about

244
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:11,950
options sometimes we're talking about
 

245
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,220
options sometimes we're talking about
one dollar more expensive or something

246
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,230
one dollar more expensive or something
 

247
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,860
one dollar more expensive or something
like that you can go to a full suite of

248
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:16,870
like that you can go to a full suite of
 

249
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,190
like that you can go to a full suite of
an endpoint security product which will

250
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,200
an endpoint security product which will
 

251
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,610
an endpoint security product which will
provide you a much better protection

252
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:23,620
provide you a much better protection
 

253
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,500
provide you a much better protection
overall protection on your computer okay

254
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,510
overall protection on your computer okay
 

255
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,270
overall protection on your computer okay
so I don't want to I don't want to give

256
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
so I don't want to I don't want to give
 

257
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,830
so I don't want to I don't want to give
the impression that this is a sales

261
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,450
pitch that we're trying to say you know
choose ESET endpoint protection advanced

262
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:33,460
choose ESET endpoint protection advanced
 

263
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,700
choose ESET endpoint protection advanced
because it's a sales pitch I want to

264
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:35,710
because it's a sales pitch I want to
 

265
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,810
because it's a sales pitch I want to
instead kind of what what features of a

266
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:39,820
instead kind of what what features of a
 

267
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,830
instead kind of what what features of a
product like endpoint protection

268
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:40,840
product like endpoint protection
 

269
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,160
product like endpoint protection
advanced isn't it that are taking

270
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,170
advanced isn't it that are taking
 

271
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,990
advanced isn't it that are taking
protection to the next level for those

272
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
protection to the next level for those
 

273
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,480
protection to the next level for those
users so file this attacks yep

274
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,490
users so file this attacks yep
 

275
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,220
users so file this attacks yep
ransomware attacks like these are

276
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,230
ransomware attacks like these are
 

277
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,800
ransomware attacks like these are
threats that can take businesses and put

278
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:52,810
threats that can take businesses and put
 

279
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,630
threats that can take businesses and put
them out of this gifts yep then and

280
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:54,640
them out of this gifts yep then and
 

281
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,490
them out of this gifts yep then and
bankrupt their owners yeah absolutely

282
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:56,500
bankrupt their owners yeah absolutely
 

283
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,100
bankrupt their owners yeah absolutely
that's the reason saying yeah so what

284
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,110
that's the reason saying yeah so what
 

285
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,560
that's the reason saying yeah so what
what features so are those more advanced

286
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,570
what features so are those more advanced
 

287
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,270
what features so are those more advanced
why do I need to pay more and yeah

288
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
why do I need to pay more and yeah
 

289
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,050
why do I need to pay more and yeah
absolutely

it specifically tree set the modules
 

293
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,280
it specifically tree set the modules
that we add those more advanced features

294
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,290
that we add those more advanced features
 

295
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,960
that we add those more advanced features
is called hips which stands for host

296

intrusion prevention system and that's

298
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,070
intrusion prevention system and that's
 

299
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,920
intrusion prevention system and that's
where we have the advanced memory

300
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:13,930
where we have the advanced memory
 

301
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,780
where we have the advanced memory
scanner which is basically protecting

302
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:15,790
scanner which is basically protecting
 

303
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,030
scanner which is basically protecting
your memory in real time the final and

304
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,040
your memory in real time the final and
 

305
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,100
your memory in real time the final and
that mostly associated to the file as

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,110
that mostly associated to the file as
 

307
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,670
that mostly associated to the file as
malware we have the exploit blocker so

308
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
malware we have the exploit blocker so
 

309
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,980
malware we have the exploit blocker so
let's say whenever a new company

310
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:25,990
let's say whenever a new company
 

311
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,500
let's say whenever a new company
releases a publicly available exploit

312
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:28,510
releases a publicly available exploit
 

313
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,930
releases a publicly available exploit
for a vulnerability let's say this week

314
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:30,940
for a vulnerability let's say this week
 

315
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,710
for a vulnerability let's say this week
we actually had a pretty severe

316
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
we actually had a pretty severe
 

317
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,810
we actually had a pretty severe
vulnerability with Microsoft and they

318
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:34,820
vulnerability with Microsoft and they
 

319
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
vulnerability with Microsoft and they
actually release the patch the next day

320
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:36,830
actually release the patch the next day
 

321
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,140
actually release the patch the next day
or something like that

322
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,150
or something like that
 

323
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,100
or something like that
we will prevent that vulnerability from

324
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,110
we will prevent that vulnerability from
 

325
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,280
we will prevent that vulnerability from
being exploited this is exactly what he

326
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,290
being exploited this is exactly what he
 

327
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,110
being exploited this is exactly what he
said accomplished with wanna cry

328
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
said accomplished with wanna cry
 

329
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,170
said accomplished with wanna cry
absolutely yes it was eternal it was yep

330
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:50,180
absolutely yes it was eternal it was yep
 

331
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,750
absolutely yes it was eternal it was yep
it was the summer vulnerability and yes

332
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:52,760
it was the summer vulnerability and yes
 

333
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,580
it was the summer vulnerability and yes
we were able to actually prevent that

334
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:54,590
we were able to actually prevent that
 

335
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,410
we were able to actually prevent that
vulnerability from being exploited in

336
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:56,420
vulnerability from being exploited in
 

337
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,360
vulnerability from being exploited in
the first place so even though wanna cry

338
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,370
the first place so even though wanna cry
 

339
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,430
the first place so even though wanna cry
had never been discovered or ESET was

340
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,440
had never been discovered or ESET was
 

341
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,900
had never been discovered or ESET was
already proactively protected absolutely

342
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:01,910
already proactively protected absolutely
 

343
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,810
already proactively protected absolutely
and we were actually providing that kind

344
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:04,820
and we were actually providing that kind
 

345
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,480
and we were actually providing that kind
of fix two weeks before when a crime

346
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,490
of fix two weeks before when a crime
 

347
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,790
of fix two weeks before when a crime
actually existed fantastic we had that

348
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:09,800
actually existed fantastic we had that
 

349
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,250
actually existed fantastic we had that
kind of preventive maintenance let's say

350
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:12,260
kind of preventive maintenance let's say
 

351
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,380
kind of preventive maintenance let's say
and you want an anti-malware product

352
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,390
and you want an anti-malware product
 

353
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,240
and you want an anti-malware product
that is going to be proactive instead of

354
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,250
that is going to be proactive instead of
 

355
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,550
that is going to be proactive instead of
reactive absolutely yes because in the

356
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
reactive absolutely yes because in the
 

357
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,870
reactive absolutely yes because in the
case of something like ransomware you

358
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:19,880
case of something like ransomware you
 

359
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,010
case of something like ransomware you
can lose everything

360
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,020
can lose everything
 

361
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,860
can lose everything
yep and so there is no reactive response

362
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:23,870
yep and so there is no reactive response
 

363
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,200
yep and so there is no reactive response
to that then I hope your backups are

364
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,210
to that then I hope your backups are
 

365
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,600
to that then I hope your backups are
good yes actually

366
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:28,610
good yes actually
 

367
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,580
good yes actually
going back to that initial question

368
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:30,590
going back to that initial question
 

369
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,560
going back to that initial question
about the current threat landscape you

370
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,570
about the current threat landscape you
 

371
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,120
about the current threat landscape you
are seeing the still you're seeing a

372
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,130
are seeing the still you're seeing a
 

373
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,700
are seeing the still you're seeing a
really prevalent presence of the res

374
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:36,710
really prevalent presence of the res
 

375
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,820
really prevalent presence of the res
more however now the the crypto actors

376
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:39,830
more however now the the crypto actors
 

377
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,470
more however now the the crypto actors
in just in this general they are not

378
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:41,480
in just in this general they are not
 

379
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,390
in just in this general they are not
only encrypting your data and holding

380
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,400
only encrypting your data and holding
 

381
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,550
only encrypting your data and holding
you for ransom but if you're not paying

382
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:45,560
you for ransom but if you're not paying
 

383
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,290
you for ransom but if you're not paying
they are actually releasing the data and

384
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,300
they are actually releasing the data and
 

385
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,270
they are actually releasing the data and
selling that data so it's going to be

386
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
selling that data so it's going to be
 

387
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,700
selling that data so it's going to be
even more yes well that can be even

388
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:51,710
even more yes well that can be even
 

389
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,120
even more yes well that can be even
worse yeah so Wow yeah that's scary

390
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,130
worse yeah so Wow yeah that's scary
 

391
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,770
worse yeah so Wow yeah that's scary
stuff

392
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:55,780
stuff
 

393
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,570
stuff
what else does does your product so

394
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:58,580
what else does does your product so
 

395
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,590
what else does does your product so
again to just look at why I get the

396
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:02,600
again to just look at why I get the
 

397
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,270
again to just look at why I get the
question all the time Ralph yep why

398
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,280
question all the time Ralph yep why
 

399
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,360
question all the time Ralph yep why
should I buy the greater product when

400
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,370
should I buy the greater product when
 

401
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,130
should I buy the greater product when
the antivirus has been working so well

402
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,140
the antivirus has been working so well
 

403
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,150
the antivirus has been working so well
for me for so long

404
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
for me for so long
 

405
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,070
for me for so long
so as you said it might be a couple

406
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
so as you said it might be a couple
 

407
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,430
so as you said it might be a couple
bucks more don't learn so more per seat

408
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
bucks more don't learn so more per seat
 

409
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,830
bucks more don't learn so more per seat
which can be a lot if you've got ten

410
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
which can be a lot if you've got ten
 

411
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,659
which can be a lot if you've got ten
thousand computers but in a in a small

412
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:19,669
thousand computers but in a in a small
 

413
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:22,480
thousand computers but in a in a small
medium business it's not that much why

414
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,490
medium business it's not that much why
 

415
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,020
medium business it's not that much why
would I pay more the additional features

416
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,030
would I pay more the additional features
 

417
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,510
would I pay more the additional features
that we have in the full endpoint

418
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:28,520
that we have in the full endpoint
 

419
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,570
that we have in the full endpoint
security solution from a technical

420
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:31,580
security solution from a technical
 

421
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,100
security solution from a technical
perspective and again I'm talking about

422
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,110
perspective and again I'm talking about
 

423
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,430
perspective and again I'm talking about
$1 more is well worth it the value is

424
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:36,440
$1 more is well worth it the value is
 

425
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,159
$1 more is well worth it the value is
actually there so I'm thinking of not

426
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,169
actually there so I'm thinking of not
 

427
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,290
actually there so I'm thinking of not
only adding additional layers of

428
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:41,300
only adding additional layers of
 

429
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
only adding additional layers of
protection to your computer either at

430
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,310
protection to your computer either at
 

431
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,420
protection to your computer either at
home or or

432
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,430
home or or
 

433
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,880
home or or
at your business but I'm also getting

434
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:46,890
at your business but I'm also getting
 

435
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,769
at your business but I'm also getting
additional visibility on what's

436
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:48,779
additional visibility on what's
 

437
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,750
additional visibility on what's
happening on your environment as well so

438
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,760
happening on your environment as well so
 

439
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,240
happening on your environment as well so
let's say one of the features on that

440
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,250
let's say one of the features on that
 

441
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,300
let's say one of the features on that
new on that bigger product let's say the

442
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,310
new on that bigger product let's say the
 

443
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,850
new on that bigger product let's say the
endpoint security is a personal firewall

444
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:58,860
endpoint security is a personal firewall
 

445
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,949
endpoint security is a personal firewall
which will potentially hit place your

446
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
which will potentially hit place your
 

447
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,350
which will potentially hit place your
Windows Firewall in my computer and not

448
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
Windows Firewall in my computer and not
 

449
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,590
Windows Firewall in my computer and not
only it will allow you to actually have

450
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
only it will allow you to actually have
 

451
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,030
only it will allow you to actually have
visibility on the network layer so

452
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,040
visibility on the network layer so
 

453
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,550
visibility on the network layer so
instead of only looking for viruses or

454
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
instead of only looking for viruses or
 

455
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,260
instead of only looking for viruses or
Trojans or ransomware

456
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,270
Trojans or ransomware
 

457
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,150
Trojans or ransomware
I'm also looking for duplicate IP

458
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm also looking for duplicate IP
 

459
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,889
I'm also looking for duplicate IP
address and looking for DNS poisoning

460
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:15,899
address and looking for DNS poisoning
 

461
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,190
address and looking for DNS poisoning
that's interesting yeah yeah so now

462
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
that's interesting yeah yeah so now
 

463
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,610
that's interesting yeah yeah so now
possibly network traffic problems or

464
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:22,620
possibly network traffic problems or
 

465
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,620
possibly network traffic problems or
even social yes which are not

466
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:24,630
even social yes which are not
 

467
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,510
even social yes which are not
necessarily security incidents but it

468
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:29,520
necessarily security incidents but it
 

469
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,030
necessarily security incidents but it
can be a natural threat so for example

470
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,040
can be a natural threat so for example
 

471
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,889
can be a natural threat so for example
one of the detection that we have is a

472
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:33,899
one of the detection that we have is a
 

473
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,100
one of the detection that we have is a
port scanning so maybe your users is a

474
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,110
port scanning so maybe your users is a
 

475
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,710
port scanning so maybe your users is a
given actor inside your network is

476
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:39,720
given actor inside your network is
 

477
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,410
given actor inside your network is
scanning your servers for whatever

478
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:42,420
scanning your servers for whatever
 

479
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,079
scanning your servers for whatever
reason where's they're not supposed to

480
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:45,089
reason where's they're not supposed to
 

481
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,420
reason where's they're not supposed to
be doing that so yeah it gives you that

482
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:47,430
be doing that so yeah it gives you that
 

483
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,220
be doing that so yeah it gives you that
visibility so you can actually go to the

484
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,230
visibility so you can actually go to the
 

485
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,540
visibility so you can actually go to the
user and have a conversation to see

486
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:50,550
user and have a conversation to see
 

487
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,190
user and have a conversation to see
what's what's going on yeah I've never

488
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,200
what's what's going on yeah I've never
 

489
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,810
what's what's going on yeah I've never
really thought about that as a threat

490
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:53,820
really thought about that as a threat
 

491
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,810
really thought about that as a threat
yeah because like a duplicate IP address

492
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:56,820
yeah because like a duplicate IP address
 

493
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,190
yeah because like a duplicate IP address
you just think oh well I accidentally

494
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,200
you just think oh well I accidentally
 

495
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,110
you just think oh well I accidentally
assign same IP to a printer or something

496
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,120
assign same IP to a printer or something
 

497
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,940
assign same IP to a printer or something
but what if it's a thread actor exactly

498
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:01,950
but what if it's a thread actor exactly
 

499
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,460
but what if it's a thread actor exactly
yeah maybe someone is doing that IP

500
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:04,470
yeah maybe someone is doing that IP
 

501
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,460
yeah maybe someone is doing that IP
address yeah mm-hmm interesting and you

502
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,470
address yeah mm-hmm interesting and you
 

503
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,710
address yeah mm-hmm interesting and you
mentioned about the firewall how and I

504
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:09,720
mentioned about the firewall how and I
 

505
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,090
mentioned about the firewall how and I
don't want to put you too much on the

Microsoft Windows 10 comes with a

510
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,100
Microsoft Windows 10 comes with a
 

511
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,269
Microsoft Windows 10 comes with a
firewall yep so do I really need to

512
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:16,279
firewall yep so do I really need to
 

513
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,070
firewall yep so do I really need to
supplement my anti-malware with a

514
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,080
supplement my anti-malware with a
 

515
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,769
supplement my anti-malware with a
firewall for Mesa we do see a two main

516
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:21,779
firewall for Mesa we do see a two main
 

517
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,620
firewall for Mesa we do see a two main
approaches for that hit placement let's

518
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:24,630
approaches for that hit placement let's
 

519
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,900
approaches for that hit placement let's
say so the first one is ease of use so

520
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:26,910
say so the first one is ease of use so
 

521
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,910
say so the first one is ease of use so
we do provide a management console that

522
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:28,920
we do provide a management console that
 

523
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,150
we do provide a management console that
will allow you to have much more

524
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
will allow you to have much more
 

525
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,100
will allow you to have much more
user-friendly configuration and

526
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,110
user-friendly configuration and
 

527
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,720
user-friendly configuration and
deployment of that that's specific and

528
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:35,730
deployment of that that's specific and
 

529
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,010
deployment of that that's specific and
we're talking centralized management

530
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,020
we're talking centralized management
 

531
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,769
we're talking centralized management
slowly okay so all 10,000 of my

532
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:39,779
slowly okay so all 10,000 of my
 

533
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,690
slowly okay so all 10,000 of my
computer's yes absolutely four or five

534
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:41,700
computer's yes absolutely four or five
 

535
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,340
computer's yes absolutely four or five
of my computer's just create the

536
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:43,350
of my computer's just create the
 

537
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,110
of my computer's just create the
policies and you push it out to your

538
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
policies and you push it out to your
 

539
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,970
policies and you push it out to your
computers yes again it's fully automated

540
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:46,980
computers yes again it's fully automated
 

541
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,180
computers yes again it's fully automated
so it's it's pretty convenient to use

542
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,190
so it's it's pretty convenient to use
 

543
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,650
so it's it's pretty convenient to use
and the second main reason is the

544
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:51,660
and the second main reason is the
 

545
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,870
and the second main reason is the
visibility so you do have access to a

546
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
visibility so you do have access to a
 

547
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,020
visibility so you do have access to a
lot of reporting that's actually coming

548
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,030
lot of reporting that's actually coming
 

549
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,350
lot of reporting that's actually coming
on the natural fire rope component let's

550
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
on the natural fire rope component let's
 

551
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,020
on the natural fire rope component let's
say you can get a list of all the users

552
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,030
say you can get a list of all the users
 

553
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,810
say you can get a list of all the users
on your network that's had a port

554
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:04,820
on your network that's had a port
 

555
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,760
on your network that's had a port
scanner on your environment on a given

556
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,770
scanner on your environment on a given
 

557
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,980
scanner on your environment on a given
time frame so that's the kind of

558
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:08,990
time frame so that's the kind of
 

559
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,740
time frame so that's the kind of
awareness that kind of visibility that

560
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:10,750
awareness that kind of visibility that
 

561
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,810
awareness that kind of visibility that
some other vendors will not allow you to

anti-malware product from three years
 

613
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,610
anti-malware product from three years
ago you might be losing some advant

614
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:21,620
ago you might be losing some advant
 

615
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,850
ago you might be losing some advant
advantage in there so you might be

616
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:23,860
advantage in there so you might be
 

617
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,500
advantage in there so you might be
actually lagging behind and sometime

618
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:26,510
actually lagging behind and sometime

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,190
are well protected we are seeing coming
 

643
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,830
are well protected we are seeing coming
back to your question we are seeing a

644
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:56,840
back to your question we are seeing a
 

645
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,710
back to your question we are seeing a
lot of the

646
00:12:59,710 --> 00:12:59,720
lot of the
 

647
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,650
lot of the
the movements in general whenever we are

648
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:02,660
the movements in general whenever we are
 

649
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,410
the movements in general whenever we are
looking at the data so we are seeing a

650
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:05,420
looking at the data so we are seeing a
 

651
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,840
looking at the data so we are seeing a
lot of the new threats coming from two

652
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:07,850
lot of the new threats coming from two
 

653
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,680
lot of the new threats coming from two
main avenues let's say so the first one

654
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:11,690
main avenues let's say so the first one
 

655
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,670
main avenues let's say so the first one
is hardware

656
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:12,680
is hardware
 

657
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,610
is hardware
so whenever thinking of FEMA for example

658
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:15,620
so whenever thinking of FEMA for example
 

659
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,740
so whenever thinking of FEMA for example
you have a BIOS update you have a new

660
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:17,750
you have a BIOS update you have a new
 

661
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,170
you have a BIOS update you have a new
chipset on your computer yes it's

662
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,180
chipset on your computer yes it's
 

663
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,490
chipset on your computer yes it's
actually possible to in fact or true -

664
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:24,500
actually possible to in fact or true -
 

665
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,560
actually possible to in fact or true -
in fact that given a component on your

666
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,570
in fact that given a component on your
 

667
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,420
in fact that given a component on your
computer another point that we have and

668
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,430
computer another point that we have and
 

669
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,100
computer another point that we have and
we actually have a lot of research going

670
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,110
we actually have a lot of research going
 

671
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,280
we actually have a lot of research going
on on that specific one is the user

672
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,290
on on that specific one is the user
 

673
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,430
on on that specific one is the user
behavior so let's say that usually when

674
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
behavior so let's say that usually when
 

675
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,930
behavior so let's say that usually when
you think user behavior probably the

676
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:40,940
you think user behavior probably the
 

677
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,660
you think user behavior probably the
biggest example is credit card company

678
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:43,670
biggest example is credit card company
 

679
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,820
biggest example is credit card company
so you have your credit card in Canada

680
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:45,830
so you have your credit card in Canada
 

681
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,650
so you have your credit card in Canada
that credit card has been used in

682
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:47,660
that credit card has been used in
 

683
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,880
that credit card has been used in
somewhere in Asia and hey even though

684
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:51,890
somewhere in Asia and hey even though
 

685
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,610
somewhere in Asia and hey even though
online shopping is available everywhere

686
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:54,620
online shopping is available everywhere
 

687
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
online shopping is available everywhere
it might create a trigger hey it's

688
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:56,630
it might create a trigger hey it's
 

689
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,150
it might create a trigger hey it's
something that card is not supposed to

690
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
something that card is not supposed to
 

691
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,820
something that card is not supposed to
be used in Asia for example in Europe or

692
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:00,830
be used in Asia for example in Europe or
 

693
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,020
be used in Asia for example in Europe or
anywhere else and we are started to see

694
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,030
anywhere else and we are started to see
 

695
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,530
anywhere else and we are started to see
some some some efforts from different

696
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,540
some some some efforts from different
 

697
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,140
some some some efforts from different
vendors actually to try to correlate all

698
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,150
vendors actually to try to correlate all
 

699
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,830
vendors actually to try to correlate all
the incidents or all the the incidents

700
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:14,840
the incidents or all the the incidents
 

701
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,180
the incidents or all the the incidents
in general the security state that we

702
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,190
in general the security state that we
 

703
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,850
in general the security state that we
flag and we also try to map that to the

704
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:18,860
flag and we also try to map that to the
 

705
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,250
flag and we also try to map that to the
actual user behavior so hey that user

706
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:21,260
actual user behavior so hey that user
 

707
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,280
actual user behavior so hey that user
has just had his email access in Canada

708
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,290
has just had his email access in Canada
 

709
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,520
has just had his email access in Canada
being accessed in Europe name that's a

710
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,530
being accessed in Europe name that's a
 

711
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,930
being accessed in Europe name that's a
user that's always traveling so yeah

712
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:28,940
user that's always traveling so yeah
 

713
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,090
user that's always traveling so yeah
it's kind of expected maybe not that

714
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,100
it's kind of expected maybe not that
 

715
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,130
it's kind of expected maybe not that
user is an internal user he has no

716
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,140
user is an internal user he has no
 

717
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,500
user is an internal user he has no
reason to have that kind of exposure in

718
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,510
reason to have that kind of exposure in
 

719
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,360
reason to have that kind of exposure in
there so we can actually create a ticket

720
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,370
there so we can actually create a ticket
 

721
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,960
there so we can actually create a ticket
and we can flag that as a potential

722
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:39,970
and we can flag that as a potential
 

723
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,970
and we can flag that as a potential
incident so your admins can can take a

724
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:42,980
incident so your admins can can take a
 

725
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,310
incident so your admins can can take a
look at it interesting and we can do

726
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
look at it interesting and we can do
 

727
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,760
look at it interesting and we can do
that

728
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:45,770
that
 

729
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,010
that
so this is not as a third-party service

730
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,020
so this is not as a third-party service
 

731
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,430
so this is not as a third-party service
but as an internal absolutely our yeah

732
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
but as an internal absolutely our yeah
 

733
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,340
but as an internal absolutely our yeah
in mastering and again the amount of

734
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,350
in mastering and again the amount of
 

735
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,380
in mastering and again the amount of
data that's coming out of those surfaces

736
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,390
data that's coming out of those surfaces
 

737
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,500
data that's coming out of those surfaces
is so big that automation is it's

738
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,510
is so big that automation is it's
 

739
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,480
is so big that automation is it's
critical for that and so we do have a

740
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,490
critical for that and so we do have a
 

741
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,370
critical for that and so we do have a
lot of automation capabilities in our

742
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:03,380
lot of automation capabilities in our
 

743
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,220
lot of automation capabilities in our
products yeah

744
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,230
products yeah
 

745
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,260
products yeah
and again it's everything to make your

746
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,270
and again it's everything to make your
 

747
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,880
and again it's everything to make your
life easier and I've never really

748
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:08,890
life easier and I've never really
 

749
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,320
life easier and I've never really
thought of it outside the context of the

750
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,330
thought of it outside the context of the
 

751
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,660
thought of it outside the context of the
credit card like a perfect example if I

752
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,670
credit card like a perfect example if I
 

753
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,970
credit card like a perfect example if I
view it and you see it sometimes where

754
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:14,980
view it and you see it sometimes where
 

755
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,580
view it and you see it sometimes where
is it's an inconvenience but if your

756
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:17,590
is it's an inconvenience but if your
 

757
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,260
is it's an inconvenience but if your
credit card ever was stolen and used

758
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,270
credit card ever was stolen and used
 

759
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,090
credit card ever was stolen and used
maliciously then you want to know about

760
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,100
maliciously then you want to know about
 

761
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,650
maliciously then you want to know about
it and here's a service that you're

762
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:22,660
it and here's a service that you're
 

763
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,330
it and here's a service that you're
offering and evolving in 2020 that is

764
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:26,340
offering and evolving in 2020 that is
 

765
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,280
offering and evolving in 2020 that is
in-house so absolutely I have control

766
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,290
in-house so absolutely I have control
 

767
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,870
in-house so absolutely I have control
over that so you're thinking of your

768
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
over that so you're thinking of your
 

769
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,550
over that so you're thinking of your
credit card what if it's your email

770
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
credit card what if it's your email
 

771
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,880
credit card what if it's your email
access or maybe your scene number public

772
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,890
access or maybe your scene number public
 

773
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,310
access or maybe your scene number public
data basically it's private it should be

774
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
data basically it's private it should be
 

775
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,500
data basically it's private it should be
private and we are trying to make it

776
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,510
private and we are trying to make it
 

777
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,020
private and we are trying to make it
remain private so is that the evolution

778
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,030
remain private so is that the evolution
 

779
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,810
remain private so is that the evolution
of malware do you think is targeting

780
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:45,820
of malware do you think is targeting
 

781
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,490
of malware do you think is targeting
data yeah I would say so I don't see

782
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:50,500
data yeah I would say so I don't see
 

783
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,840
data yeah I would say so I don't see
specific data to confirm that that

784
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:54,850
specific data to confirm that that
 

785
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,700
specific data to confirm that that
application but I do believe that's

786
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:56,710
application but I do believe that's
 

787
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,170
application but I do believe that's
that's something that is going to happen

788
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:58,180
that's something that is going to happen
 

789
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,070
that's something that is going to happen
we are having we are three SS citizens

790
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,080
we are having we are three SS citizens

so yeah the question for years when it
 

847
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
so yeah the question for years when it
was just viruses on the landscape the

848
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:17,670
was just viruses on the landscape the
 

849
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,860
was just viruses on the landscape the
question was always what's the

850
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:18,870
question was always what's the
 

851
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,990
question was always what's the
motivation of a hacker yep to do this

852
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,000
motivation of a hacker yep to do this
 

853

911
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,320
being able to block a threat before it
was even known yeah it wasn't having a

912
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,330
was even known yeah it wasn't having a
 

913
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,900
was even known yeah it wasn't having a
thing they actually blocked the exploit

914
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:38,910
thing they actually blocked the exploit
 

915
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,660
thing they actually blocked the exploit
that allowed the thing to exist right so

916
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:41,670
that allowed the thing to exist right so
 

917
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,660
that allowed the thing to exist right so
that when the thing existed the exploit

918
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,670
that when the thing existed the exploit
 

919
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,910
that when the thing existed the exploit
was already blocked by ESET so so that

920
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:46,920
was already blocked by ESET so so that
 

921
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,400
was already blocked by ESET so so that
