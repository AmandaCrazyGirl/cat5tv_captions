screen so that you guys can see what I
see it's on dual screen so I'm gonna

52
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
see it's on dual screen so I'm gonna
 

53
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,710
see it's on dual screen so I'm gonna
instead set this to mirror so what I'm

54
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:09,720
instead set this to mirror so what I'm
 

55
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,289
instead set this to mirror so what I'm
seeing on my screen is I'm gonna drag

56
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:12,299
seeing on my screen is I'm gonna drag
 

57
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,820

this over for you so that you can see
 

59
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,039
this over for you so that you can see
because it's actually operating as two

60
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,049
because it's actually operating as two
 

61
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,690
because it's actually operating as two
monitors okay

62
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,700
monitors okay
 

63
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,120
monitors okay
so on my screen here I'm gonna check

64
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,130
so on my screen here I'm gonna check
 

65
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,730
so on my screen here I'm gonna check
that checkbox that's it and so this is

66
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:22,740
that checkbox that's it and so this is
 

67
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,490
that checkbox that's it and so this is
over USB see so it actually has a video

68
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,500
over USB see so it actually has a video
 

69
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,289
over USB see so it actually has a video
output and I've selected to show the

70
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:27,299
output and I've selected to show the
 

71
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,469
output and I've selected to show the
same thing on both screens so presumably

72
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
same thing on both screens so presumably
 

73
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,840
same thing on both screens so presumably
if I hit apply this is really awkward

74
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:32,850
if I hit apply this is really awkward
 

75
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,569
if I hit apply this is really awkward
because that screen is actually not a

76
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:35,579
because that screen is actually not a
 

77
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,550
because that screen is actually not a
real screen there we go okay so keep

78
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
real screen there we go okay so keep
 

79
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,219
real screen there we go okay so keep
this configuration and now we can both

80
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:40,229
this configuration and now we can both
 

81
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,789
this configuration and now we can both
see the exact same screen so you and I

82
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:43,799
see the exact same screen so you and I
 

83
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,190
see the exact same screen so you and I
are looking at the same screen here so

84
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,200
are looking at the same screen here so
 

85
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,490
are looking at the same screen here so
that's USB C output and that's important

86
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,500
that's USB C output and that's important

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:19,889
cheese because I wanted to point out
 

159
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,719
cheese because I wanted to point out
that we actually have a built-in webcam

160
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:23,729
that we actually have a built-in webcam
 

161
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,749
that we actually have a built-in webcam
on this system so this is a 1080p webcam

162
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:26,759
on this system so this is a 1080p webcam
 

163
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,719
on this system so this is a 1080p webcam
and even though with cheese booted here

164
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:29,729
and even though with cheese booted here
 

165
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,999
and even though with cheese booted here
so this is gonna presumably there we go

166
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,009
so this is gonna presumably there we go
 

167
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,129
so this is gonna presumably there we go
you can see that the the framerate is

168
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:34,139
you can see that the the framerate is
 

169
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,610
you can see that the the framerate is
really really poor right right there I

170
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:37,620
really really poor right right there I
 

171
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,809
really really poor right right there I
am but but it does work really quite

172
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:44,819
am but but it does work really quite
 

173
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,460
am but but it does work really quite
well and the picture looks pretty good

174
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:46,470
well and the picture looks pretty good
 

175
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,819
well and the picture looks pretty good
let's take a quick is not just a setting

176
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:49,829
let's take a quick is not just a setting
 

177
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,860
let's take a quick is not just a setting
as to why it's so low well I don't know

178
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:51,870
as to why it's so low well I don't know
 

179
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,719
as to why it's so low well I don't know
yeah I think what we're gonna find is

180
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:56,729
yeah I think what we're gonna find is
 

181
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,429
yeah I think what we're gonna find is
that with something like the pine Book

182
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:58,439
that with something like the pine Book
 

183
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,709
that with something like the pine Book
Pro and I think this is important to

184
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:00,719
Pro and I think this is important to
 

185
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,119
Pro and I think this is important to
note and maybe this is something I

186
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:02,129
note and maybe this is something I
 

187
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,199
note and maybe this is something I
should have mentioned right off the top

188
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,209
should have mentioned right off the top
 

189
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,749
should have mentioned right off the top
what it is this is let's consider it

190
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:05,759
what it is this is let's consider it
 

191
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,849
what it is this is let's consider it
experimental let's consider this

192
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:07,859
experimental let's consider this
 

193
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,379
experimental let's consider this
something that is bleeding edge and

194
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:09,389
something that is bleeding edge and
 

195
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,879
something that is bleeding edge and
mind-blowing yeah let's say if you are a

196
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:12,889
mind-blowing yeah let's say if you are a
 

197
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,689
mind-blowing yeah let's say if you are a
Linux lover if you love to tinker this

198
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:17,699
Linux lover if you love to tinker this
 

199
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,360
Linux lover if you love to tinker this
might be a notebook for you yeah because

200
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,370
might be a notebook for you yeah because
 

201
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,039
might be a notebook for you yeah because
you're probably gonna run into little

202
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:22,049
you're probably gonna run into little
 

203
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,209
you're probably gonna run into little
issues like that did you see the

204
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:23,219
issues like that did you see the
 

205
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,790
issues like that did you see the
countdown 1 2 3 2 1 and it was like all

206
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
countdown 1 2 3 2 1 and it was like all
 

207
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,700
countdown 1 2 3 2 1 and it was like all
gibberish

208
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:26,710
gibberish
 

209
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,840
gibberish
there's something wrong there and I'm

210
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:27,850
there's something wrong there and I'm
 

211
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,980
there's something wrong there and I'm
gonna probably have to figure that out

212
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:28,990
gonna probably have to figure that out
 

213
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,830
gonna probably have to figure that out
if I if I care I kind of thought it was

214
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
if I if I care I kind of thought it was
 

215
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,409
if I if I care I kind of thought it was
a cool feature it looks like a flash

216
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:33,419
a cool feature it looks like a flash
 

217
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,700
a cool feature it looks like a flash
it's like three two one to prepare this

218
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:35,710
it's like three two one to prepare this
 

219
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,290
it's like three two one to prepare this
like screen flash it's like okay but it

220
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,300
like screen flash it's like okay but it
 

221
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,520
like screen flash it's like okay but it
didn't really look like a three did it

222
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:38,530
didn't really look like a three did it
 

223
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,330
didn't really look like a three did it
it was like gibberish

224
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:39,340
it was like gibberish
 

225
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,210
it was like gibberish
but reminds me of like the first ever

226
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:42,220
but reminds me of like the first ever
 

227
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,540
but reminds me of like the first ever
episode thanks Asha that's exactly what

228
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,550
episode thanks Asha that's exactly what
 

229
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,360
episode thanks Asha that's exactly what
this looks like but I mean there is a

230
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,370
this looks like but I mean there is a
 

231
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,960
this looks like but I mean there is a
webcam yes big deal so there's there's a

232
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:51,970
webcam yes big deal so there's there's a
 

233
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,560
webcam yes big deal so there's there's a
community that is involved in all Pine

234
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:55,570
community that is involved in all Pine
 

235
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,749
community that is involved in all Pine
64 products and that's a big part of

64 products and that's a big part of
 

237
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,040
64 products and that's a big part of
this is that you can get into the

256
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:20,830
Linux system tools speaking of let's
 

257
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,620
Linux system tools speaking of let's
bring up like system monitor and let's

258
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:22,630
bring up like system monitor and let's
 

259
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,150
bring up like system monitor and let's
just kind of see what this looks like

260
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
just kind of see what this looks like
 

261
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,159
just kind of see what this looks like
hold on for a second so this is a two

262
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:26,169
hold on for a second so this is a two
 

263
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,230
hold on for a second so this is a two
hundred dollar Linux notebook computer

264
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
hundred dollar Linux notebook computer
 

265
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,189
hundred dollar Linux notebook computer
that's this thin that's a that has no

266
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:32,199
that's this thin that's a that has no
 

267
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,330
that's this thin that's a that has no
moving parts so if I can I don't know if

268
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:36,340
moving parts so if I can I don't know if
 

269
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,100
moving parts so if I can I don't know if
you can really get your head around that

270
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,110
you can really get your head around that
 

271
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,920
you can really get your head around that
at home but when this is sitting on my

272
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:40,930
at home but when this is sitting on my
 

273
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,649
at home but when this is sitting on my
lap there's no fan noise yep there's

274
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:43,659
lap there's no fan noise yep there's
 

275
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,529
lap there's no fan noise yep there's
very little heat and a little bit of

276
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:46,539
very little heat and a little bit of
 

277
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,420
very little heat and a little bit of
heat off of the one side where the SOC

278
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,430
heat off of the one side where the SOC
 

279
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,149
heat off of the one side where the SOC
is that's the system-on-chip to see what

280
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:51,159
is that's the system-on-chip to see what
 

281
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,219
is that's the system-on-chip to see what
we would call a CPU yeah there's a

282
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:53,229
we would call a CPU yeah there's a
 

283
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,149
we would call a CPU yeah there's a
little bit of heat there but it's

284
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:54,159
little bit of heat there but it's
 

285
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,909
little bit of heat there but it's
dissipated quite well but really like

286
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:56,919
dissipated quite well but really like
 

287
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,450
dissipated quite well but really like
there's no noise coming off so you don't

288
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:00,460
there's no noise coming off so you don't
 

289
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,100
there's no noise coming off so you don't
have any of those moving parts that you

290
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,110
have any of those moving parts that you
 

291
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,290
have any of those moving parts that you
do on a normal traditional laptop so

292
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:04,300
do on a normal traditional laptop so
 

293
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,969
do on a normal traditional laptop so
what have I been using this for well

294
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:05,979
what have I been using this for well
 

295
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,730
what have I been using this for well
it's not a super powerful laptop but

296
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:08,740
it's not a super powerful laptop but
 

297
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,950
it's not a super powerful laptop but
it's quite good as far as getting on the

307
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,089
keyboard now it's got a nice touchpad
you've got to update the touchpad

308
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:20,099
you've got to update the touchpad
 

309
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,890
you've got to update the touchpad
firmware make sure you do that right out

310
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:22,900

about that in the pine 64 forums very
 

317
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,510
about that in the pine 64 forums very
very important for for the sensitivity

this becomes a terminal so it's
 

375
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,120
this becomes a terminal so it's
brilliant for that it's proven itself to

brilliant for that it's proven itself to
 

377
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,920
brilliant for that it's proven itself to
be brilliant for that but at the same

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:50,930
be brilliant for that but at the same
 

379
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,080
be brilliant for that but at the same
time it's also great without that

380
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,090
time it's also great without that

let's get a quick boo at this system

392
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:08,660
let's get a quick boo at this system
 

393
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,480
let's get a quick boo at this system
itself because I mean though the real

394
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,490
itself because I mean though the real
 

395
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,310
itself because I mean though the real
question is okay if I'm not using it

396
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,320
question is okay if I'm not using it
 

397
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,890
question is okay if I'm not using it
connected to a big powerful system is it

398
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:14,900
connected to a big powerful system is it
 

399
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,740
connected to a big powerful system is it
still gonna work as a pretty decent

400
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:17,750
still gonna work as a pretty decent
 

401
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,910
still gonna work as a pretty decent
computer one of the things that you're

402
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:18,920
computer one of the things that you're
 

403
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,470
computer one of the things that you're
going to notice is down here at the

404
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:20,480
going to notice is down here at the
 

405
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,750
going to notice is down here at the
bottom right it's jumping around between

406
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:22,760
bottom right it's jumping around between
 

407
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,390
bottom right it's jumping around between
four hundred and eight megahertz to one

408
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,400
four hundred and eight megahertz to one
 

409
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,610
four hundred and eight megahertz to one
point four two gigahertz and so on it's

410
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:27,620
point four two gigahertz and so on it's
 

411
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,260
point four two gigahertz and so on it's
jumping all over the place because it's

412
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,270
jumping all over the place because it's
 

413
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,529
jumping all over the place because it's
selecting the processor frequency based

414
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:32,539
selecting the processor frequency based
 

415
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,810
selecting the processor frequency based
on my usage so it's getting faster and

416
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:34,820
on my usage so it's getting faster and
 

417
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,730
on my usage so it's getting faster and
is giving more power taking more juice

418
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:36,740
is giving more power taking more juice
 

419
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,320
is giving more power taking more juice
from the 10,000 milliamp hour battery

420
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,330
from the 10,000 milliamp hour battery
 

421
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,370
from the 10,000 milliamp hour battery
and based on my requirements right but

422
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:42,380
and based on my requirements right but
 

423
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,440
and based on my requirements right but
if I'm not really doing much if it's

424
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,450
if I'm not really doing much if it's
 

425
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,210
if I'm not really doing much if it's
idling it'll just clock itself down to

426
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,220
idling it'll just clock itself down to
 

427
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,760
idling it'll just clock itself down to
408 megahertz which is going to use very

428
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:48,770
408 megahertz which is going to use very
 

429
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,250
408 megahertz which is going to use very
very little power presume

430
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,260
very little power presume
 

431
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,220
very little power presume
all right so I'm just gonna cancel out

432
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,230
all right so I'm just gonna cancel out
 

433
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,770
all right so I'm just gonna cancel out
of that guy and let's jump onto YouTube

to learn Microsoft Office that is not
 

583
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,460
to learn Microsoft Office that is not
the skill sets that so so to translate

584
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,470
the skill sets that so so to translate
 

585
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,710
the skill sets that so so to translate
that from Microsoft office - LibreOffice

586
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
that from Microsoft office - LibreOffice
 

587
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,840
that from Microsoft office - LibreOffice
can be a challenge so I'll give you that

588
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:16,850
can be a challenge so I'll give you that
 

589
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,110
can be a challenge so I'll give you that
one little caveat and it's and that is a

590
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,120
one little caveat and it's and that is a
 

591
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
one little caveat and it's and that is a
problem but that's a problem in the

592
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,130
problem but that's a problem in the
 

593
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,890
problem but that's a problem in the
education sector that's not a problem

594
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:23,900
education sector that's not a problem
 

595
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,550
education sector that's not a problem
with this device and I think if we have

596
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,560
with this device and I think if we have
 

597
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,350
with this device and I think if we have
a good troubleshooting mind and and

598
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
a good troubleshooting mind and and
 

599
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,780
a good troubleshooting mind and and
maybe a father who is willing to take

different but see we have a dual boot
 

613
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,540
different but see we have a dual boot
system yeah both Linux and Windows yeah

on your on your Linux machine bring up

648
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:37,380
on your on your Linux machine bring up
 

649
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,590
on your on your Linux machine bring up
synaptic package manager that's where I

650
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
synaptic package manager that's where I
 

651
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,750
synaptic package manager that's where I
am on Debian anyways and do a search and

652
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
am on Debian anyways and do a search and
 

653
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,170
am on Debian anyways and do a search and
type in and guess what we're gonna

654
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,180
type in and guess what we're gonna
 

655
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,410
type in and guess what we're gonna
find no guesses there it is right

656

find no guesses there it is right
 

657
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,300
find no guesses there it is right
so I can just install it just because

658
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,310
so I can just install it just because
 

659
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,340
so I can just install it just because
it's Linux it's not a Chromebook right

736
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:38,740
Mike microSD for booting yeah could you
 

737
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,510
Mike microSD for booting yeah could you
put say like retropie on that Mike rusty

738

put say like retropie on that Mike rusty
 

739
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,120
put say like retropie on that Mike rusty
and boot up on a micro SD well you'd

740
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,130
and boot up on a micro SD well you'd
 

741
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,790
and boot up on a micro SD well you'd
have to have a rock 64 pine book 64

compatible version of retropie so yeah

744
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:52,660
compatible version of retropie so yeah
 

745
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,630
compatible version of retropie so yeah
what you would need to do I think would

746
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:54,640
what you would need to do I think would
 

747
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,760
what you would need to do I think would
be instead to take the approach of

748
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:56,770
be instead to take the approach of
 

749
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,890
be instead to take the approach of
installing Debian and then installing

750
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:58,900
installing Debian and then installing
 

751
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,860
installing Debian and then installing
retropie on top of that a little bit

752
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:01,870
retropie on top of that a little bit
 

753
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,360
retropie on top of that a little bit
different I don't think there's anyone

754
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,370
different I don't think there's anyone
 

755
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,210
different I don't think there's anyone

rock for the pine book pro yet took it
 

759
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,460
rock for the pine book pro yet took it
but I'm not entirely certain of that

760
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,470
but I'm not entirely certain of that
 

761
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,470
but I'm not entirely certain of that
it's just a distro it's a it's a Debian

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,480
it's just a distro it's a it's a Debian
 

763
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,990
it's just a distro it's a it's a Debian
based or a boon to based distro so it

764
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
based or a boon to based distro so it
 

765
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,610
based or a boon to based distro so it
could be done yeah it's just I don't

766
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:17,620
could be done yeah it's just I don't

789
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,760

reboots once in a while but I found if I
 

791
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,980
reboots once in a while but I found if I
if I hard set the frequency of the CPU

792
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:46,990
if I hard set the frequency of the CPU
 

793
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,270
if I hard set the frequency of the CPU
it doesn't do it anymore

794
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,280
it doesn't do it anymore
 

795
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,010
it doesn't do it anymore
ah and we've seen tonight that it didn't

ah and we've seen tonight that it didn't
 

797

798
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,120
do it as well and I didn't change that
 

799
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,520
