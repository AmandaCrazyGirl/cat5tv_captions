00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:04,519

these days were surrounded by things

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:04,529
these days were surrounded by things
 

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,509
these days were surrounded by things
like chromebooks pine book pros and and

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:07,519
like chromebooks pine book pros and and
 

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,860
like chromebooks pine book pros and and
devices I mean the Chromebook is the

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:09,870
devices I mean the Chromebook is the
 

7
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,499
devices I mean the Chromebook is the
perfect example of a device that

8
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:12,509
perfect example of a device that
 

9
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,570
perfect example of a device that
utilizes the Internet as an app

10
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:16,580
utilizes the Internet as an app
 

11
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,490
utilizes the Internet as an app
infrastructure right so I think about

12
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:19,500
infrastructure right so I think about
 

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,580
infrastructure right so I think about
things like like my Google Drive and

14
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:22,590
things like like my Google Drive and
 

15
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,000
things like like my Google Drive and
Google Docs and Google sheets and and

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,010
Google Docs and Google sheets and and
 

17
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,030
Google Docs and Google sheets and and
and how those are very fast becoming my

18
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,040
and how those are very fast becoming my
 

19
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,400
and how those are very fast becoming my
applications for doing things like

20
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,410
applications for doing things like
 

21
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,590
applications for doing things like
document editing mm-hmm I don't install

22
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,600
document editing mm-hmm I don't install
 

23
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,479
document editing mm-hmm I don't install
Microsoft Office anymore

24
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:38,489
Microsoft Office anymore
 

25
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,709
Microsoft Office anymore

you had Microsoft like Word and all that

30
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:47,879
you had Microsoft like Word and all that
 

31
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,479
you had Microsoft like Word and all that
you can they've got online based like

32
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:50,489
you can they've got online based like
 

33
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,670
you can they've got online based like
Outlook has gone into the cloud it's

34
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,680
Outlook has gone into the cloud it's
 

35
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,549
Outlook has gone into the cloud it's
like a browser-based thing but so these

36
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:55,559
like a browser-based thing but so these
 

37
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,040
like a browser-based thing but so these
are all things that they used to be

38
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,050
are all things that they used to be
 

39
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,779
are all things that they used to be
applications on our computer and now

40
00:00:59,779 --> 00:00:59,789
applications on our computer and now
 

41
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,639
applications on our computer and now
they're progressively becoming more and

42
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:01,649
they're progressively becoming more and
 

43
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,000
they're progressively becoming more and
more cloud driven and that means they

44
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,010
more cloud driven and that means they
 

45
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,359
more cloud driven and that means they
are accessible through your web browser

46
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:07,369
are accessible through your web browser
 

47
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,359
are accessible through your web browser

abilities to create a bit more of a
 

95
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,750
abilities to create a bit more of a
native feel to websites right so that

96
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
native feel to websites right so that
 

97
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,630
native feel to websites right so that
they feel more like native apps

98
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:13,640
they feel more like native apps
 

99
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,930
they feel more like native apps
but there's it's it's never really been

100
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:16,940
but there's it's it's never really been
 

101
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,010
but there's it's it's never really been
solidified as a standard so what rises

102
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,020
solidified as a standard so what rises
 

103
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,100

for your for your browser sessions but
 

111
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,080
for your for your browser sessions but
it got discontinued so then it just

112
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,090
it got discontinued so then it just
 

113
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,310
it got discontinued so then it just
fizzled out but peppermint OS has done

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,030
site-specific browser but the interface
 

123
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,050
site-specific browser but the interface
is really unique in that it it is

like a native application it repairs all
 

139
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,390
like a native application it repairs all
of that browser stuff around the edges

they've made it very very simple but I'm
 

145
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,039
they've made it very very simple but I'm
not using peppermint okay I'm actually

146
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,049
not using peppermint okay I'm actually
 

147
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,490
not using peppermint okay I'm actually
using Linux Mint and on Linux Mint which

148
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,500
using Linux Mint and on Linux Mint which
 

149
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,039
using Linux Mint and on Linux Mint which
is a debian derivative it's also it's

150
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,049
is a debian derivative it's also it's
 

151
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,440
is a debian derivative it's also it's
based on Ubuntu and this will go for

152
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,450
based on Ubuntu and this will go for
 

153
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,259
based on Ubuntu and this will go for
Ubuntu what what I want to show you is

154
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:38,269
Ubuntu what what I want to show you is
 

155
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,009
Ubuntu what what I want to show you is
for any Debian based distro so that's

156
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:42,019
for any Debian based distro so that's
 

157
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,400
for any Debian based distro so that's
Debian obviously we've wound to mint

158
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,410
Debian obviously we've wound to mint
 

159
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,220
Debian obviously we've wound to mint
Linux Mint so I'm on Linux Mint 19 and

160
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,230
Linux Mint so I'm on Linux Mint 19 and
