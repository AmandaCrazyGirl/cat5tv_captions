one side interestingly enough so the one
 

319
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,800
one side interestingly enough so the one
the unit I have at home the connectors

320
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,810
the unit I have at home the connectors
 

321

the unit I have at home the connectors
are on either side so I've got three and

322
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:58,910
are on either side so I've got three and
 

323
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,240

on one side so your device is gonna have
 

331
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,270
on one side so your device is gonna have
to sit because it's a short cable with

cause problems but just for plugging it
 

341
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,080
cause problems but just for plugging it
in oops

342
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,090
in oops
 

343
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,790
in oops
of course it's USB you got to do it

344
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
of course it's USB you got to do it
 

345
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,200
of course it's USB you got to do it
three different ways that's right yeah

346
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,210
three different ways that's right yeah
 

347

yeah so but it just sticks in quite
 

349
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,480
yeah so but it just sticks in quite
simply alright there's pretty simple

350
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,490
simply alright there's pretty simple
 

351
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,970
simply alright there's pretty simple
tech folks but yeah it really I did a

352
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:33,980
tech folks but yeah it really I did a
 

353
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,950
tech folks but yeah it really I did a
USBC for my phone perfect it's already

354
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:35,960
USBC for my phone perfect it's already
 

355
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,330
USBC for my phone perfect it's already
connected to my phone because I thought

356
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:37,340
connected to my phone because I thought
 

357
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,000
connected to my phone because I thought
hey we can actually try like see okay

358
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,010
hey we can actually try like see okay
 

359
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,270
hey we can actually try like see okay
then see if it explodes or if it charges

360
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,280
then see if it explodes or if it charges
 

361
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,880
then see if it explodes or if it charges
it's gonna do one of those two things

you're gonna learn one day the way to
 

367
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,320
you're gonna learn one day the way to
plug it in I know I haven't so okay so

parts yeah exactly
so that's a nice very nice feature and

468
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:55,459
so that's a nice very nice feature and
 

469
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,960
so that's a nice very nice feature and
it is 10 am 50 watt total power what I

470
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,970
it is 10 am 50 watt total power what I
 

471
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,290
it is 10 am 50 watt total power what I
don't see though is fast church I don't

472
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,300
don't see though is fast church I don't
 

473
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,390
don't see though is fast church I don't
see that either and it's a good comment

474
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:05,400
see that either and it's a good comment
 

475
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,290
see that either and it's a good comment
because that's one of the questions

476
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,300
because that's one of the questions
 

477
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
because that's one of the questions
we're gonna get so ya know it looks like

478
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,310
we're gonna get so ya know it looks like
 

479
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,730
we're gonna get so ya know it looks like
it's just straight like just regular

480
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:10,740
it's just straight like just regular
 

481
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,640
it's just straight like just regular
regular charge power yep now this

482
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:13,650
regular charge power yep now this
 

483
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,530
regular charge power yep now this
particular one now I'm sure those exist

484
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:15,540
particular one now I'm sure those exist
 

485
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,720
particular one now I'm sure those exist
but I mean we're talking about charging

486
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:17,730
but I mean we're talking about charging
 

487
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,840
but I mean we're talking about charging
six devices simultaneously which is

488
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:20,850
six devices simultaneously which is
 

489
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,090
six devices simultaneously which is
pretty impressive it's pretty good from

490
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,100
pretty impressive it's pretty good from
 

491
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,160
pretty impressive it's pretty good from
a single power I also like the stability

492
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,170
a single power I also like the stability
 

493
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,740
a single power I also like the stability
of this one Jeff it's very solid doesn't

494
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:27,750
of this one Jeff it's very solid doesn't
 

495
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,990
of this one Jeff it's very solid doesn't
move now one thing I noticed about the

496
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
move now one thing I noticed about the
 

497
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,640
move now one thing I noticed about the
one that I had at home for the life mate

498
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,650
one that I had at home for the life mate
 

499
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,130
one that I had at home for the life mate
I can't think of the model or the brand

500
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:34,140
I can't think of the model or the brand
 

501
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,110
I can't think of the model or the brand
that it is there's an eye out there like

502
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,120
that it is there's an eye out there like
 

503
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,699
that it is there's an eye out there like
tell there's tons yeah search for them

504
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:37,709
tell there's tons yeah search for them
 

505
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,850
tell there's tons yeah search for them
but what I wanted to check with yours is

506
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:39,860
but what I wanted to check with yours is
 

507
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,040
but what I wanted to check with yours is
the gap between the placement spots so

508
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,050
the gap between the placement spots so
 

509
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,579
the gap between the placement spots so
my phone has a bit of a dip on the back

510
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:49,589
my phone has a bit of a dip on the back
 

511
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,019
my phone has a bit of a dip on the back
right where it bigger

512
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:51,029
right where it bigger
 

513
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,750
right where it bigger
yeah it is thicker and so your phone

514
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
yeah it is thicker and so your phone
 

515
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,390
yeah it is thicker and so your phone
sits quite nicely it's leaned back when

516
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:56,400
sits quite nicely it's leaned back when
 

517
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,570
sits quite nicely it's leaned back when
I put mine in because of that it sits up

518
00:10:59,570 --> 00:10:59,580
I put mine in because of that it sits up
 

519
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,750
I put mine in because of that it sits up
there's pretty much okay does that now I

520
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:02,760
there's pretty much okay does that now I
 

521
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,330
there's pretty much okay does that now I
said it'll forward bothers them well

522
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:05,340
said it'll forward bothers them well
 

523
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,270
said it'll forward bothers them well
what it does create a problem is if you

524
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,280
what it does create a problem is if you
 

525
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,220
what it does create a problem is if you
have if you're trying to organize all

526
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,230
have if you're trying to organize all
 

527
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,090
have if you're trying to organize all
your devices succinctly it doesn't work

528
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,100
your devices succinctly it doesn't work
 

529
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,350
your devices succinctly it doesn't work
as well if one of them is falling

530
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
as well if one of them is falling
 

531
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,730
as well if one of them is falling
forward it bounces them all around

532
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:16,740
forward it bounces them all around
 

533
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,260
forward it bounces them all around
especially if you utter diode your

534
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,270
especially if you utter diode your
 

535
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,850
especially if you utter diode your
phones when you put them in the charger

536
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,860
phones when you put them in the charger
 

537
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,730
phones when you put them in the charger
no but for the one I have at home I have

538
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:22,740
no but for the one I have at home I have
 

539
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,410
no but for the one I have at home I have
to do it in a certain order because of

540
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:24,420
to do it in a certain order because of
 

541
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,780
to do it in a certain order because of
the different case sizes oh one goes

542
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:26,790
the different case sizes oh one goes
 

543
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,290
the different case sizes oh one goes
forward they all follow okay knocks them

544
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,300
forward they all follow okay knocks them
 

545
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,870
forward they all follow okay knocks them
out so okay aware of that like all these

546
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
out so okay aware of that like all these
 

547
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,100
out so okay aware of that like all these
things he wouldn't even think about

548
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,110
things he wouldn't even think about
 

549
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,130
things he wouldn't even think about
exactly because of the the gap I mean

550
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,140
exactly because of the the gap I mean
 

551
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,590
exactly because of the the gap I mean
that's that's finger width that's it so

552
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
that's that's finger width that's it so
 

553
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,570
that's that's finger width that's it so
it's not like it's a big gap if you have

554
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:41,580
it's not like it's a big gap if you have
 

555
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
it's not like it's a big gap if you have
a tablet app your tablet's gonna sit

556
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:43,590
a tablet app your tablet's gonna sit
 

557
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,790
a tablet app your tablet's gonna sit
fairly snug yeah yeah so be aware of

558
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
fairly snug yeah yeah so be aware of
 

559
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,350
fairly snug yeah yeah so be aware of
that but otherwise that's it that's a

560
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,360
that but otherwise that's it that's a
 

561
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,320
that but otherwise that's it that's a
nice little okay the suckers small any

562
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,330
nice little okay the suckers small any
 

563
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,640
nice little okay the suckers small any
guesses any guesses iPod

564
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:57,650
guesses any guesses iPod

first-generation no ice crazy

566
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
first-generation no ice crazy
 

567
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,280
first-generation no ice crazy
it doesn't even like when they came with

568
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,290
it doesn't even like when they came with
 

569
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,960
it doesn't even like when they came with
with like full touchscreen but that fits

570
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:05,970
with like full touchscreen but that fits
 

571
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,030
with like full touchscreen but that fits
quite nicely but yeah I mean if you have

572
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
quite nicely but yeah I mean if you have
 

573
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,530
quite nicely but yeah I mean if you have
a tablet or something it's gonna sit a

574
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:09,540
a tablet or something it's gonna sit a
 

575
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,840
a tablet or something it's gonna sit a
little bit higher and you can see like

576
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:11,850
little bit higher and you can see like
 

577
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,400
little bit higher and you can see like
mine is back on and that because that

578
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,410
mine is back on and that because that
 

579
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,110
mine is back on and that because that
little knob is not there but if you had

580
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
little knob is not there but if you had
 

581
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,990
little knob is not there but if you had
a tablet with a thicker case it's gonna

582
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
a tablet with a thicker case it's gonna
 

583
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,180
a tablet with a thicker case it's gonna
sit straight up there's no give and the

584
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,190
sit straight up there's no give and the
 

585
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,470
sit straight up there's no give and the
chance with that is if you accidentally

586
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
chance with that is if you accidentally
 

587
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,030
chance with that is if you accidentally
bump it you could potentially break the

588
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
bump it you could potentially break the
 

589
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,030
bump it you could potentially break the
plastic just be well yeah well yeah I

590
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,040
plastic just be well yeah well yeah I
 

591
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,860
plastic just be well yeah well yeah I
guess but I mean you're gonna find a

592
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:27,870
guess but I mean you're gonna find a
 

593
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,350
guess but I mean you're gonna find a
safe place to put this kind of site yeah

594
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:30,360
safe place to put this kind of site yeah
 

595
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,330
safe place to put this kind of site yeah
plain and simple so but it keeps it in a

596
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:32,340
plain and simple so but it keeps it in a
 

597
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,030
plain and simple so but it keeps it in a
centralized location and allows you you

598
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
centralized location and allows you you
 

599
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,170
centralized location and allows you you
know especially if you have multiple

600
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,180
know especially if you have multiple
 

601
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,640
know especially if you have multiple
devices at your home to organize

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,550
there you you know maybe you've got
young kids it's like get off the phone

608
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
young kids it's like get off the phone
 

609
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,600
young kids it's like get off the phone
that's your spot where you go this is

610
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:44,610
that's your spot where you go this is
 

611
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,850
that's your spot where you go this is
the phone charging sport yeah it's not

612
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:46,860
the phone charging sport yeah it's not
 

613
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,820
the phone charging sport yeah it's not
in the rooms at night it's a central

614
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:49,830
in the rooms at night it's a central
 

615
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,560
in the rooms at night it's a central
location you know where every phone is

616
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:51,570
location you know where every phone is
 

617
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,390
location you know where every phone is
and it's like you didn't plug it in this

618
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:53,400
and it's like you didn't plug it in this
 

619
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,770
and it's like you didn't plug it in this
is kind of what I'm thinking like if if

620
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:54,780
