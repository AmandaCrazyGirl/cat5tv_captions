00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:04,950
I'm learning from the technology that
 

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,639
I'm learning from the technology that
I've invested in now my budget was 100

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:07,649
I've invested in now my budget was 100
 

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,110
I've invested in now my budget was 100
bucks as you know so a few weeks ago we

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
bucks as you know so a few weeks ago we
 

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,180
bucks as you know so a few weeks ago we
started looking at the various

8
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,190
started looking at the various
 

9
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,830
started looking at the various
technologies like my fitness tracker

10
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:12,840
technologies like my fitness tracker
 

11
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,340
technologies like my fitness tracker
like my smart scale that allow me to

12
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,350
like my smart scale that allow me to
 

13
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,500
like my smart scale that allow me to
educate myself about my health to be

14
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:18,510

15
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,300
educate myself about my health to be
able to lose some weight inevitably as

16
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,310
able to lose some weight inevitably as
 

17
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,740
able to lose some weight inevitably as
kind of a side effect of that and I have

18
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:23,750
kind of a side effect of that and I have
 

19
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,359
kind of a side effect of that and I have
consistently so so whenever I tell you

20
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:26,369
consistently so so whenever I tell you
 

21
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,279
consistently so so whenever I tell you
how much I've lost it's it's only based

22
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:28,289
how much I've lost it's it's only based
 

23
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,429
how much I've lost it's it's only based
on consistency so if I if I hit seven

24
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
on consistency so if I if I hit seven
 

25
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,100
on consistency so if I if I hit seven
point six pounds loss and then I went

26
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,110
point six pounds loss and then I went
 

27
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,510
point six pounds loss and then I went
back to six point I'm gonna I'm not

28
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
back to six point I'm gonna I'm not
 

29
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,130
back to six point I'm gonna I'm not
gonna tell you seven but I've been
