it literally caught on fire inside the
 

95
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,699
it literally caught on fire inside the

you didn't do this the first time but it

112
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:47,670
you didn't do this the first time but it
 

113
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,949

really did make me think about all those
 

115
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,860
really did make me think about all those
times that I've thought about doing like

116
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:50,870
times that I've thought about doing like
 

117
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:58,309
times that I've thought about doing like
wooden builds maybe yeah it was a really

118
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
wooden builds maybe yeah it was a really
 

119
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,379
wooden builds maybe yeah it was a really
good thing that my computer chassis was

120
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:00,389
good thing that my computer chassis was
 

121
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,929
good thing that my computer chassis was
made of aluminum what maybe that and and

122
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:02,939
made of aluminum what maybe that and and
 

123
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,059
made of aluminum what maybe that and and
fairly airtight to the point where not a

124
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,069
fairly airtight to the point where not a
 

125
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,119
fairly airtight to the point where not a
whole lot of oxygen can get in once once

126
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:08,129
whole lot of oxygen can get in once once
 

127
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,849
whole lot of oxygen can get in once once
it's expelled right yeah so like the

128
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:10,859
it's expelled right yeah so like the
 

129
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,740
it's expelled right yeah so like the
burning didn't affect any of the other

130
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:12,750
burning didn't affect any of the other
 

131
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,170
burning didn't affect any of the other
component no because it was in the in

132
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,180
component no because it was in the in
 

133
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,259
component no because it was in the in
the drive tray so it was contained

134
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:18,269
the drive tray so it was contained
 

135
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:20,420
the drive tray so it was contained
within the tray so so the tray itself

136
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,430
within the tray so so the tray itself
 

137
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,849
within the tray so so the tray itself
actually had some plastic components as

138
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:22,859
actually had some plastic components as
 

139
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,009
actually had some plastic components as
well those plastic components melted and

140
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:25,019
well those plastic components melted and
 

141
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,909
well those plastic components melted and
dripped down Wow but the Washburn it was

142
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:28,919
dripped down Wow but the Washburn it was
 

143
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,979
dripped down Wow but the Washburn it was
low it was a fire it was a fire inside

00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:30,989
low it was a fire it was a fire inside
 

145
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,509
low it was a fire it was a fire inside
the case of the hard drive yeah the SSD

146
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
the case of the hard drive yeah the SSD
 

147
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,210
the case of the hard drive yeah the SSD
it was a and that's the crazy part is

148
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,220
it was a and that's the crazy part is
 

149
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,280
it was a and that's the crazy part is
that it's an SSD and like I I can see

150
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,290
that it's an SSD and like I I can see
 

151
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,379
that it's an SSD and like I I can see
that maybe with you know traditional

152
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:42,389
that maybe with you know traditional
 

153
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,449
that maybe with you know traditional
hard drive with moving parts but an SSD

154
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:44,459
hard drive with moving parts but an SSD
 

155
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,059
hard drive with moving parts but an SSD
to catch fire I would be really proud if

156
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:47,069
to catch fire I would be really proud if
 

157
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,530
to catch fire I would be really proud if
it was like I'm moving parts thing like

158
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:48,540
it was like I'm moving parts thing like
 

159
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,610
it was like I'm moving parts thing like
I worked that beast so I got it up to 15

160
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,620
I worked that beast so I got it up to 15
 

161
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,020
I worked that beast so I got it up to 15
billion rpm and then nobody must have

162
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,030
billion rpm and then nobody must have
 

163
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,059
billion rpm and then nobody must have
burnt for a while it was pretty bad so

164
00:03:59,059 --> 00:03:59,069
burnt for a while it was pretty bad so
 

165
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,869
burnt for a while it was pretty bad so
so you did you get alert ah this is just

166
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
so you did you get alert ah this is just
 

167
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,729
so you did you get alert ah this is just
my desktop computer I didn't have names

168
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:04,739
my desktop computer I didn't have names
 

169
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,039
my desktop computer I didn't have names
running monitoring on it or anything

170
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,049
running monitoring on it or anything
 

171
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,979
running monitoring on it or anything
like that however because the board the

172
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:09,989
like that however because the board the
 

173
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,629
like that however because the board the
it did make me think because the

174
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:11,639
it did make me think because the
 

175
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,180
it did make me think because the
motherboard has USB ports on the

176
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,190
motherboard has USB ports on the
 

177
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,520
motherboard has USB ports on the
motherboard yeah I think I might put a

178
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:16,530
motherboard yeah I think I might put a
 

179
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,959
motherboard yeah I think I might put a
temper device in my computer chassis and

180
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:20,969
temper device in my computer chassis and
 

181
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,440
temper device in my computer chassis and
a temper devices like a USB thermal

182
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,450
a temper devices like a USB thermal
 

183
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:24,830
a temper devices like a USB thermal
sensor

184
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840
sensor
 

185
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,990
sensor
an episode with what we did to do that

186
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
an episode with what we did to do that
 

187
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,150
an episode with what we did to do that
so imagine putting that in and then I

188
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
so imagine putting that in and then I
 

189
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,530
so imagine putting that in and then I
could have gotten an alert from Nimes

190
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,540
could have gotten an alert from Nimes
 

191
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,219
could have gotten an alert from Nimes
Linux that said hey your computer is a

192
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:37,229
Linux that said hey your computer is a
 

193
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,560
Linux that said hey your computer is a
hundred and forty degrees Celsius and

194
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:39,570
hundred and forty degrees Celsius and
 

195
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:45,290
hundred and forty degrees Celsius and
would you have been like a mistake that

196
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,300
would you have been like a mistake that
 

197
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,060
would you have been like a mistake that
would have been a little bit of a

198
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,070
would have been a little bit of a
 

199
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,580
would have been a little bit of a
strange alert for sure however you can

200
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:49,590
strange alert for sure however you can
 

201
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,490
strange alert for sure however you can
trust names that the data is accurate so

202
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:52,500
trust names that the data is accurate so
 

203
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,620
trust names that the data is accurate so
then you would have gone to see it in

204
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:54,630
then you would have gone to see it in
 

205
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,879
then you would have gone to see it in
action brought some marshmallows yeah

206
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:57,889
action brought some marshmallows yeah
 

207
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,170
action brought some marshmallows yeah
but thankfully was contained because

208
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,180
but thankfully was contained because
 

209
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,730
but thankfully was contained because
that could have impacted the entire

210
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:01,740
that could have impacted the entire
 

211
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,990
that could have impacted the entire
office yeah but doesn't it make you

212
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,000
office yeah but doesn't it make you
 

213
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,270
office yeah but doesn't it make you
think about like all these like builds

214
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
think about like all these like builds
 

215
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,060
think about like all these like builds
that I'm doing and and some of them made

216
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,070
that I'm doing and and some of them made
 

217
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,750
that I'm doing and and some of them made
of cardboard so I'm really kind of

218
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:11,760
of cardboard so I'm really kind of
 

219
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,030
of cardboard so I'm really kind of
rethinking the materials that I use for

220
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,040
rethinking the materials that I use for
 

221
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,770
rethinking the materials that I use for
my builds and and you know I think about

222
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:15,780
my builds and and you know I think about
 

223
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,830
my builds and and you know I think about
kks be cases for for single board

224
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:18,840
kks be cases for for single board
 

225
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,450
kks be cases for for single board
computers and how they're like solid

226
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:20,460
computers and how they're like solid
 

227
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,060
computers and how they're like solid
steel mm-hmm bent and fabricated steel

228
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,070
steel mm-hmm bent and fabricated steel
 

229
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,420
steel mm-hmm bent and fabricated steel
and that just says quality to me and

230
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:26,430
and that just says quality to me and
 

231
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,550
and that just says quality to me and
like that's gonna that's gonna protect

232
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
like that's gonna that's gonna protect
 

233
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,710
like that's gonna that's gonna protect
me an event of like a short circuit or

234
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
me an event of like a short circuit or
 

235
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,850
me an event of like a short circuit or
something like that I don't know what

236
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:31,860
something like that I don't know what
 

237
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,990
something like that I don't know what
happened to the drive it was like an

238
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000
happened to the drive it was like an
 

239
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,909
happened to the drive it was like an
internal thing I've never had a hard

240
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:34,919
internal thing I've never had a hard
 

241
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,010
internal thing I've never had a hard
drive catching never know how to power

242
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,020
drive catching never know how to power
 

243
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,610
drive catching never know how to power
supply's I haven't I've never I've never

244
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:40,620
supply's I haven't I've never I've never
 

245
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,790
supply's I haven't I've never I've never
had a fire like that yeah I was the

246
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:43,800
had a fire like that yeah I was the
 

247
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,469
had a fire like that yeah I was the
computer that I bailed out on four years

248
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:45,479
computer that I bailed out on four years
 

249
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,110
computer that I bailed out on four years
ago six months in all sudden I'm like

250
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
ago six months in all sudden I'm like
 

251
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,790
ago six months in all sudden I'm like
what is that smell

252
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:49,800
what is that smell
 

253
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,650
what is that smell
yeah and then I went down with a

254
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:51,660
yeah and then I went down with a
 

255
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,040
yeah and then I went down with a
computer and I realize it's smoked sure

256
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,050
computer and I realize it's smoked sure
 

257
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,810
computer and I realize it's smoked sure
but I've burnt capacitors I've had

258
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:56,820
but I've burnt capacitors I've had
 

259
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,940
but I've burnt capacitors I've had
things burst yeah but I'm talking this

260
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:58,950
things burst yeah but I'm talking this
 

261
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,690
things burst yeah but I'm talking this
caught on fire like literally I was not

262
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:02,700
caught on fire like literally I was not
 

263
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,370
caught on fire like literally I was not
from heat this was like a short circuit

264
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,380
from heat this was like a short circuit
 

265
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,409
from heat this was like a short circuit
in the power lines or something within

266
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:06,419
in the power lines or something within
 

267
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,890
in the power lines or something within
the drive the crazy stuff so so now I

268
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:09,900
the drive the crazy stuff so so now I
 

269
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,050
the drive the crazy stuff so so now I
mean hey I've never seen it happen

270
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
mean hey I've never seen it happen
 

271
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,710
mean hey I've never seen it happen
before but now I know it could happen it

272
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
before but now I know it could happen it
 

273
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,200
before but now I know it could happen it
actually did happen to Robbie what are

274
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,210
actually did happen to Robbie what are
 

275
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,390
actually did happen to Robbie what are
the stats I want I think we should all

276
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,400
the stats I want I think we should all
 

277
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,640
the stats I want I think we should all
try to simulate it make it happen oh

278
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,650
try to simulate it make it happen oh
 

279
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,930
try to simulate it make it happen oh
yeah I wonder if there's a kid like

280
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:29,940
yeah I wonder if there's a kid like
 

281
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,760
yeah I wonder if there's a kid like
there is some data as to what could

282
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:31,770
there is some data as to what could
 

283
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,730
there is some data as to what could
cause an SSD to light on fire what's on

284
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:34,740
cause an SSD to light on fire what's on
 

285
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,110
cause an SSD to light on fire what's on
the inside I don't think it's a very

286
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,120
the inside I don't think it's a very
 

287
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,510
the inside I don't think it's a very
common thing what what's on the inside

288
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,520
common thing what what's on the inside
 

289
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,659
common thing what what's on the inside
of it what is that you've got a PCB

290
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:41,669
of it what is that you've got a PCB
 

291
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,680
of it what is that you've got a PCB
circuit board with with with memory

292
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:45,690
circuit board with with with memory
 

293
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,529
circuit board with with with memory
modules yeah essentially and and some

294
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:48,539
modules yeah essentially and and some
 

295
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,510
modules yeah essentially and and some
resistors and all kinds of little

296
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:50,520
resistors and all kinds of little
 

297
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,600
resistors and all kinds of little
circuits and stuff but so something in

298
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:53,610
circuits and stuff but so something in
 

299
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,779
circuits and stuff but so something in
there no there's no moving parts and so

300
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:56,789
there no there's no moving parts and so
 

301
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:58,670
there no there's no moving parts and so
something in there short circuited I

302
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:58,680
something in there short circuited I
 

303
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,560
something in there short circuited I
think and maybe like 12 volt hit

304
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,570
think and maybe like 12 volt hit
 

305
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,350
think and maybe like 12 volt hit
something else and decided to explode

306
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
something else and decided to explode
 

307
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,420
something else and decided to explode
and catch one I don't know the

308
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,430
and catch one I don't know the
 

309
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,010
and catch one I don't know the
interesting is that it happened when you

310
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,020
interesting is that it happened when you
 

311
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,450
interesting is that it happened when you
weren't in the office because if it

312
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,460
weren't in the office because if it
 

313
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,070
weren't in the office because if it
