00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,789

when we clean out our computer or other

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
when we clean out our computer or other
 

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,930
when we clean out our computer or other
electronics we tend to turn to what Jeff

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:08,940
electronics we tend to turn to what Jeff

any guesses a can of compressed air

6
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:10,889
any guesses a can of compressed air
 

7
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,180
any guesses a can of compressed air
compressed air yeah a can of compressed

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,190
compressed air yeah a can of compressed
 

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,349
compressed air yeah a can of compressed
air right we've all been there anybody

10
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
air right we've all been there anybody
 

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,510
air right we've all been there anybody
who's worked on computers this is kind

12
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:20,520
who's worked on computers this is kind
 

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,070
who's worked on computers this is kind
of what we're used to using and go to

14
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
of what we're used to using and go to
 

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,410
of what we're used to using and go to
yeah the fact is is that you don't even

16
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,420
yeah the fact is is that you don't even
 

17
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,330
yeah the fact is is that you don't even
think twice this is kind of what you go

18
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:26,340
think twice this is kind of what you go
 

19
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,130
think twice this is kind of what you go
and grab but here's the thing what do

20
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,140
and grab but here's the thing what do
 

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,200
and grab but here's the thing what do
you see danger danger keep out of reach

22
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,210
you see danger danger keep out of reach
 

23
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,510
you see danger danger keep out of reach
of children extremely flammable yeah

of children extremely flammable yeah
 

25
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,459
of children extremely flammable yeah
there's a whole bunch of warning signs

there's a whole bunch of warning signs
 

27
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,190
there's a whole bunch of warning signs
all those are the things and sometimes

28
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
all those are the things and sometimes
 

29
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,840
all those are the things and sometimes
when you're working on you cleaning your

30
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:44,850
when you're working on you cleaning your
 

31
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,729
when you're working on you cleaning your
computer out or something like that it

computer out or something like that it
 

33
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,830
computer out or something like that it
can actually squirt like a moisture the

34
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:48,840
can actually squirt like a moisture the
 

35

me like I don't particularly want that
 

39
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,330
me like I don't particularly want that
getting into my computer and as it turns

40
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,340
getting into my computer and as it turns
 

41
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,889
getting into my computer and as it turns
out this is not actually full of

out this is not actually full of
 

43
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,200
out this is not actually full of
compressed air at all oh it's like

00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,210
compressed air at all oh it's like
 

45
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,139
compressed air at all oh it's like
flammable gases and a mix of all kinds

air well well I talk computers for with

76
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:41,579
air well well I talk computers for with
 

77
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,440

video professor for 20 years and I did

78
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,450
video professor for 20 years and I did
 

79
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,039
video professor for 20 years and I did
that and got out of that and a guy came

80
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,049
that and got out of that and a guy came
 

81
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,959
that and got out of that and a guy came
to me with an idea long story short it's

82
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:56,969
to me with an idea long story short it's
 

83
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,149
to me with an idea long story short it's
Canlis there is the idea

84
00:01:59,149 --> 00:01:59,159
Canlis there is the idea
 

85
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,550
Canlis there is the idea
I took the product and redesigned it

86
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,560
I took the product and redesigned it
 

87
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,170
I took the product and redesigned it
re-engineered it and it is what it is

88
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,180
re-engineered it and it is what it is
 

89
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,719
re-engineered it and it is what it is
today it's what I believe you have in

90
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:08,729
today it's what I believe you have in
 

91
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,059
today it's what I believe you have in
your hand problem I'm gonna grab it here

92
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:11,069
your hand problem I'm gonna grab it here
 

93
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,850
your hand problem I'm gonna grab it here
for for us John so here it is

94
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:13,860
for for us John so here it is
 

95
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,640
for for us John so here it is
this is the Canlis air system I've got

96
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:16,650
this is the Canlis air system I've got
 

97
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,230
this is the Canlis air system I've got
the X 3 hurricane thank you very much

98
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:18,240
the X 3 hurricane thank you very much
 

99
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,900
the X 3 hurricane thank you very much
John for sending that to us yes that's

100
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:20,910
John for sending that to us yes that's
 

101
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,450
John for sending that to us yes that's
right and so what I want to show you is

102
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:23,460
right and so what I want to show you is
 

103
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,260
right and so what I want to show you is
that the footprint between a can of

104
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,270
that the footprint between a can of
 

105
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,170
that the footprint between a can of
canned compressed air and the Canlis air

106
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,180
canned compressed air and the Canlis air
 

107
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,010
canned compressed air and the Canlis air
is roughly the same so on a shelf this

108
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,020
is roughly the same so on a shelf this
 

109
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,520
is roughly the same so on a shelf this
is virtually the same but when I think

110
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,530
is virtually the same but when I think
 

111
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,190
is virtually the same but when I think
about like what I want to what I want to

112
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,200
about like what I want to what I want to
 

113
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,990
about like what I want to what I want to
use if I'm environmentally conscious is

114
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
use if I'm environmentally conscious is
 

115
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,930
use if I'm environmentally conscious is
something like a compressor right right

116
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:44,940
something like a compressor right right
 

117
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
something like a compressor right right
which takes up a massive amount of space

118
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:46,950
which takes up a massive amount of space
 

119
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,900
which takes up a massive amount of space
compared to something like this or this

120
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:49,910
compared to something like this or this
 

121
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,060
compared to something like this or this
why does it really matter and and maybe

122
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,070
why does it really matter and and maybe
 

123
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,010
why does it really matter and and maybe
before I even ask that question John I

124
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,020
before I even ask that question John I
 

125
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,310
before I even ask that question John I
think I mentioned at the top of our

126
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,320
think I mentioned at the top of our
 

127
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,260
think I mentioned at the top of our
discussion here as a computer geek

128
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,270
discussion here as a computer geek
 

129
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,870
discussion here as a computer geek
myself as a computer user and a

130
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:02,880
myself as a computer user and a
 

131
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,180
myself as a computer user and a
technician I'm always using this kind of

132
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,190
technician I'm always using this kind of
 

133
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,740
technician I'm always using this kind of
thing that the compressed the

134
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:06,750
thing that the compressed the
 

135
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,160
thing that the compressed the
traditional compressed air and I never

136
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,170
traditional compressed air and I never
 

137
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,990
traditional compressed air and I never
think twice about it ok

138
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
think twice about it ok
 

139
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,570
think twice about it ok
so consider that like that's readily

140
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:14,580
so consider that like that's readily
 

141
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,010
so consider that like that's readily
available I can pick that up at any

142
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,020
available I can pick that up at any
 

143
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,350
available I can pick that up at any
ready shop and any computer shop is

144
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,360
ready shop and any computer shop is
 

145
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,660
ready shop and any computer shop is
selling that and as a computer guy I

146
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:20,670
selling that and as a computer guy I
 

147
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,900
selling that and as a computer guy I
have never thought twice about it and

148
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:23,910
have never thought twice about it and
 

149
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,240
have never thought twice about it and
then along comes Canlis air system and

150
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,250
then along comes Canlis air system and
 

151
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,890
then along comes Canlis air system and
starts to make me think well maybe I

152
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:30,900
starts to make me think well maybe I
 

153
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,970
starts to make me think well maybe I
should be thinking about the

154
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:31,980
should be thinking about the
 

155
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,770
should be thinking about the
environmental impact can you tell us a

156
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:33,780
environmental impact can you tell us a
 

157
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,199
environmental impact can you tell us a
little bit about what is dangerous about

158
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,209
little bit about what is dangerous about
 

159
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,550
little bit about what is dangerous about
these like compressed air dusters and

so there's many reasons that I developed

258
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:51,990
so there's many reasons that I developed
 

259
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,409
so there's many reasons that I developed
this product I mean there's the green

260
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:54,419
this product I mean there's the green
 

261
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,930
this product I mean there's the green
aspect there's a safety aspect for sure

262
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:56,940
aspect there's a safety aspect for sure
 

263
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,570
aspect there's a safety aspect for sure
and people didn't have a choice

264
00:05:59,570 --> 00:05:59,580
and people didn't have a choice
 

265
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,659
and people didn't have a choice
they they had no choice and so that's

266
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:02,669
they they had no choice and so that's
 

267
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,840
they they had no choice and so that's
why this got developed and and I made it

268
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:05,850
why this got developed and and I made it
 

269
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,970
why this got developed and and I made it
Y heard you mention about the size the

270

Y heard you mention about the size the
 

271
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,180
Y heard you mention about the size the
same size of canned air that's what we

272
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,190
same size of canned air that's what we
 

273
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,210
same size of canned air that's what we
did we had the engineers polled canned

274
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,220
did we had the engineers polled canned
 

275
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,159
did we had the engineers polled canned
air in their hand and then design this

276
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:16,169
air in their hand and then design this
 

277
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,920
air in their hand and then design this
and it's designed for a woman's hand too

speed and gradually work my way up from
 

627
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,620
speed and gradually work my way up from
there so hitting about 9 10 12 20 almost

628
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:50,630
there so hitting about 9 10 12 20 almost
 

629
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,900
there so hitting about 9 10 12 20 almost
30 kilometres an hour only see the how'd

630
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:55,910
30 kilometres an hour only see the how'd
 

631
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,990
30 kilometres an hour only see the how'd
it kind of dropped way down and then

632
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
it kind of dropped way down and then
 

633
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,310
it kind of dropped way down and then
start it up again almost like it

634
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
start it up again almost like it
 

635
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,190
start it up again almost like it
switched into second gear okay

636
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,200
switched into second gear okay
 

637
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,440
switched into second gear okay
increasing let's hit 50 kilometres an

638
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,450
increasing let's hit 50 kilometres an
 

639
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,370
increasing let's hit 50 kilometres an
hour almost there

640
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:06,380
hour almost there
 

641
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,519
hour almost there
oh and you see there it goes again

642
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:09,529
oh and you see there it goes again
 

643
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,110
oh and you see there it goes again
so now we're in like a third gear so

644
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
so now we're in like a third gear so
 

645
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,949
so now we're in like a third gear so
there's some kind of gearing mechanism

646
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:11,959
there's some kind of gearing mechanism
 

647
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,000
there's some kind of gearing mechanism
in there

648
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,010
in there
 

649
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,040
in there
and my anemometer can only go up to 90

650
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,050
and my anemometer can only go up to 90
 

651
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,500
and my anemometer can only go up to 90
kilometers an hour

652
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:17,510
kilometers an hour
 

653
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,420
kilometers an hour
we're probably gonna hit that oh there

654
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,430
we're probably gonna hit that oh there
 

655
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:26,090
we're probably gonna hit that oh there
we go 96 I guess 100 so I guess the

656
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,100
we go 96 I guess 100 so I guess the
 

657
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,070
we go 96 I guess 100 so I guess the
anemometer is reading higher than its

658
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,080
anemometer is reading higher than its
 

659
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,880
anemometer is reading higher than its
limit but it's probably inaccurate at

660
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:31,890
limit but it's probably inaccurate at
 

661
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,360
limit but it's probably inaccurate at
this point hitting a hundred and 1.5

662
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,370
this point hitting a hundred and 1.5
 

663
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,780
this point hitting a hundred and 1.5
kilometers per hour and capping off so I

664
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:38,790
kilometers per hour and capping off so I
 

665
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,880
kilometers per hour and capping off so I
think that's all my anemometer is

666
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:40,890
think that's all my anemometer is
 

667
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,340
think that's all my anemometer is
capable of but obviously we're getting

668
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,350
capable of but obviously we're getting
 

669
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,830
capable of but obviously we're getting
over 100 kilometres an hour wind off of

670
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:45,840
over 100 kilometres an hour wind off of
 

671
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,830
over 100 kilometres an hour wind off of
the x3 hurricane now John one of the

they're wondering after you've expended
 

677
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,230
they're wondering after you've expended
the 500 charges is there a way to extend

678
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,240
the 500 charges is there a way to extend
 

679
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,580
the 500 charges is there a way to extend
the life of the product buy a

680
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:58,590
the life of the product buy a
 

681
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,180
the life of the product buy a
replacement battery no how long do they

682
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,190
replacement battery no how long do they
 

683
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,020
replacement battery no how long do they
want this to last I think the rest of

684
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,030
want this to last I think the rest of
 

685
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,510

just to give you an idea around the

688
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,020
just to give you an idea around the
 

689
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,590
just to give you an idea around the
house people that have these I have

690
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
house people that have these I have
 

691
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,250
house people that have these I have
these around my house yep around the

these around my house yep around the
 

693
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,560
these around my house yep around the
house if you charge it once a month

694
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:21,570
house if you charge it once a month
 

695
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,850
house if you charge it once a month
that's probably a lot right so let's say

696
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:25,860
that's probably a lot right so let's say
 

697
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,570
that's probably a lot right so let's say
you charge it once a month so 12 times a

698
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:29,580
you charge it once a month so 12 times a
 

699
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,170
you charge it once a month so 12 times a
year and it's good for 500 times that's

700
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:33,180
year and it's good for 500 times that's
 

701
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,060
year and it's good for 500 times that's
going to do that right now how old are

702
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,070
going to do that right now how old are
 

703
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,070
going to do that right now how old are
they gonna be that's that's quite old

704
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,080
they gonna be that's that's quite old
 

705
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,040
they gonna be that's that's quite old
