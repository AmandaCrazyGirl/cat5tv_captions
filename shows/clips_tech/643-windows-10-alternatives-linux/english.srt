00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,130

so with Windows 7 being yo L aka

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:07,140
so with Windows 7 being yo L aka
 

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,650
so with Windows 7 being yo L aka
end-of-life we all have this situation

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:09,660
end-of-life we all have this situation
 

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,220
end-of-life we all have this situation
if we use Windows on our network that

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,230
if we use Windows on our network that
 

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,970
if we use Windows on our network that
well the operating system is now

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:15,980
well the operating system is now
 

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,590
well the operating system is now
depreciated it's no longer safe to use

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:18,600
depreciated it's no longer safe to use
 

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,750
depreciated it's no longer safe to use
Windows 7 that's right that's because it

12
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:20,760
Windows 7 that's right that's because it
 

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,929
Windows 7 that's right that's because it
hasn't been appreciated for a long time

14
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:22,939
hasn't been appreciated for a long time
 

15
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,179
hasn't been appreciated for a long time
well Windows 7 is is now what we call

16
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:26,189
well Windows 7 is is now what we call
 

17
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,240
well Windows 7 is is now what we call
end-of-life and and some folks have said

18
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,250
end-of-life and and some folks have said
 

19
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,370
end-of-life and and some folks have said
well I don't need Microsoft support I've

20
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,380
well I don't need Microsoft support I've
 

21
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,880
well I don't need Microsoft support I've
never once in my entire Windows usage

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:34,890
never once in my entire Windows usage
 

23
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,030
never once in my entire Windows usage
ever required Microsoft support sorry

24
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
ever required Microsoft support sorry
 

25
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,010
ever required Microsoft support sorry
and I'm all tangled up here there we go

26
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,020
and I'm all tangled up here there we go
 

27
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,709
and I'm all tangled up here there we go
now I'm better so if you do if you don't

28
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
now I'm better so if you do if you don't
 

29
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,229
now I'm better so if you do if you don't
ever have to call Microsoft support why

30
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:45,239
ever have to call Microsoft support why
 

31
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,750
ever have to call Microsoft support why
does it matter to you if Microsoft no

32
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
does it matter to you if Microsoft no
 

33
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,869
does it matter to you if Microsoft no
longer supports Windows 7 well yeah so

34
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:53,879
longer supports Windows 7 well yeah so
 

35
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,540
longer supports Windows 7 well yeah so
consider this that support so when we

36
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:56,550
consider this that support so when we
 

37
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,709
consider this that support so when we
think of support we think about being

38
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:57,719
think of support we think about being
 

39
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,029
think of support we think about being
able to pick up the phone and call

40
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
able to pick up the phone and call
 

41
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,040
able to pick up the phone and call
technical support well that's not at all

42
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,050
technical support well that's not at all
 

43
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,630
technical support well that's not at all
what it's talking about

44
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
what it's talking about
 

45
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,700
what it's talking about
what it's talking about is that the

46
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:04,710
what it's talking about is that the
 

47
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,469
what it's talking about is that the
support of basically them fixing

48
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
support of basically them fixing
 

49
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,210
support of basically them fixing
problems that they find is gone so what

50
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:14,220
problems that they find is gone so what
 

51
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,300
problems that they find is gone so what
that means is whenever a hacker finds a

52
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,310
that means is whenever a hacker finds a
 

53
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,170
that means is whenever a hacker finds a
way to compromise a Windows 7 machine

54
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:20,180
way to compromise a Windows 7 machine
 

55
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,060
way to compromise a Windows 7 machine
Microsoft used to fix it and roll it out

56
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,070
Microsoft used to fix it and roll it out
 

57
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,920
Microsoft used to fix it and roll it out
as an update and and probably break a

58
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:24,930
as an update and and probably break a
 

59
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,539
as an update and and probably break a
couple things that along the way but you

60
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:26,549
couple things that along the way but you
 

61
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,359
couple things that along the way but you
inevitably fixed the bug that was

62
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:29,369
inevitably fixed the bug that was
 

63
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,069
inevitably fixed the bug that was
causing hackers to be able to get into

64
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:31,079
causing hackers to be able to get into
 

65
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,109
causing hackers to be able to get into
your system well now they're not going

66
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
your system well now they're not going
 

67
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,380
your system well now they're not going
to do that so as hackers find exploits

68
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:36,390
to do that so as hackers find exploits
 

69
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,800
to do that so as hackers find exploits
in Windows 7 Microsoft is just going to

70
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:39,810
in Windows 7 Microsoft is just going to
 

71
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,840
in Windows 7 Microsoft is just going to
say well it's no longer supported right

72
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:41,850
say well it's no longer supported right
 

73
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,149
say well it's no longer supported right
so we are not going to be patching that

74
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
so we are not going to be patching that
 

75
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,710
so we are not going to be patching that
and now if you're running Windows 7

76
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:45,720
and now if you're running Windows 7
 

77
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,160
and now if you're running Windows 7
you've got this very bad situation and

78
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,170
you've got this very bad situation and
 

79
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,359
you've got this very bad situation and
you know maybe you've got a mix of

80
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:50,369
you know maybe you've got a mix of
 

81
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,749
you know maybe you've got a mix of
Windows 7 Linux Windows 10 and that one

82
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
Windows 7 Linux Windows 10 and that one
 

83
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,719
Windows 7 Linux Windows 10 and that one
Windows 7 machine or god forbid a

84
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:56,729
Windows 7 machine or god forbid a
 

85
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,630
Windows 7 machine or god forbid a
Windows XP machine sadly those still

86
00:01:59,630 --> 00:01:59,640
Windows XP machine sadly those still
 

87
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,130
Windows XP machine sadly those still
exist they still exist

88
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,140
exist they still exist
 

89
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,789
exist they still exist
yeah right so if any of those exists

90
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
yeah right so if any of those exists
 

91
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,530
yeah right so if any of those exists
that are no longer being patched or

92
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:06,540
that are no longer being patched or
 

93
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,160
that are no longer being patched or
supported

94
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,170
supported
 

95
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,469
supported
it can be a really bad situation because

96
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
it can be a really bad situation because
 

97
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,380
it can be a really bad situation because
that's one it's a door it's a doorway

98
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:13,390
that's one it's a door it's a doorway
 

99
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,920
that's one it's a door it's a doorway
like a back door into your computer know

100
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:16,930
like a back door into your computer know
 

101
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,130
like a back door into your computer know
your network all of all of your devices

102
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,140
your network all of all of your devices
 

103
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,880
your network all of all of your devices
time so we have to move to Windows 10

104
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:23,890
time so we have to move to Windows 10
 

105
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,750
time so we have to move to Windows 10
but maybe our computer can't handle

106
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
but maybe our computer can't handle
 

107
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,370
but maybe our computer can't handle
Windows 10 I mean we've got to get more

108
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:29,380
Windows 10 I mean we've got to get more
 

109
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,770
Windows 10 I mean we've got to get more
RAM we've got to get an SSD in order to

110
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:31,780
RAM we've got to get an SSD in order to
 

111
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,900
RAM we've got to get an SSD in order to
be able to run it at a reasonably decent

112
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:33,910
be able to run it at a reasonably decent
 

113
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,990
be able to run it at a reasonably decent
speed so that means a a new hard drive

114
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,000
speed so that means a a new hard drive
 

115
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,370
speed so that means a a new hard drive
and by that point it's like do you

116
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:38,380
and by that point it's like do you
 

117
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,839
and by that point it's like do you
really sink the money into this old

118
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:39,849
really sink the money into this old
 

119
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:40,259
really sink the money into this old
thing

120
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:40,269
thing
 

121
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:42,030
thing
so you're speaking to my current

122
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,040
so you're speaking to my current
 

123
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,460
so you're speaking to my current
situation I have an old Windows XP

124
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,470
situation I have an old Windows XP
 

125
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,030
situation I have an old Windows XP
system that I'm I'm setting up for our

126
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,040
system that I'm I'm setting up for our
 

127
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,160
system that I'm I'm setting up for our
kids at home yeah so that they can use

128
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,170
kids at home yeah so that they can use

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:00,700
want to upgrade this old system that's
 

139
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,460
want to upgrade this old system that's
10 years old yeah are you really gonna

140
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,470
10 years old yeah are you really gonna

put a couple hundred bucks into
something when you can walk into a Super

144
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:05,799
something when you can walk into a Super
 

145
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,860
something when you can walk into a Super
Center and for 600 bucks walk away with

146
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:07,870
Center and for 600 bucks walk away with
 

147
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,960
Center and for 600 bucks walk away with
a pretty decent computer exactly you

148
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:09,970
a pretty decent computer exactly you
 

149
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,960
a pretty decent computer exactly you
know but low end but fast though will

150
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:12,970
know but low end but fast though will
 

151
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,789
know but low end but fast though will
say I'm looking for the free fix

152
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:14,799
say I'm looking for the free fix
 

153
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,069
say I'm looking for the free fix
yeah you've already got the gear so you

154
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:17,079
yeah you've already got the gear so you
 

155
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,360
yeah you've already got the gear so you
know what are you gonna do

156
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,370
know what are you gonna do
 

157
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,170
know what are you gonna do
so do we put more RAM into it do we put

158
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,180
so do we put more RAM into it do we put
 

159
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,479
so do we put more RAM into it do we put
a new hard drive into it an SSD and do

160
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,489
a new hard drive into it an SSD and do
 

161
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,479
a new hard drive into it an SSD and do
we do all that work or do you just now

162
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:27,489
we do all that work or do you just now
 

163
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,400
we do all that work or do you just now
you know wipe it and put something else

164
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,410
you know wipe it and put something else
 

165
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,030
you know wipe it and put something else
on there that's powered by Linux that's

166
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
on there that's powered by Linux that's
 

167
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,000
on there that's powered by Linux that's
the option that's the one yeah so that's

168
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,010
the option that's the one yeah so that's
 

169
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,430
the option that's the one yeah so that's
what I do that's what I've done and

170
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:38,440
what I do that's what I've done and
 

171
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,440
what I do that's what I've done and
that's what I continue to do so you will

172
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,450
that's what I continue to do so you will
 

173
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,849
that's what I continue to do so you will
also do once you hear why so personally

174
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:44,859
also do once you hear why so personally
 

175
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,650
also do once you hear why so personally
so this is kind of like a personal

176
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:46,660
so this is kind of like a personal
 

177
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,590
so this is kind of like a personal
opinion piece but personally what I have

178
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:49,600
opinion piece but personally what I have
 

179
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,900
opinion piece but personally what I have
been leaning toward is Linux Mint over

180
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:51,910
been leaning toward is Linux Mint over
 

181
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,860
been leaning toward is Linux Mint over
the past little while because the

182
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:52,870
the past little while because the
 

183
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,120
the past little while because the
question comes up well what distro okay

184
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,130
question comes up well what distro okay
 

185
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,039
question comes up well what distro okay
this is a new word if you're a Windows

186
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,049
this is a new word if you're a Windows
 

187
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,099
this is a new word if you're a Windows
user yeah it's short for distribution

188
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:02,109
user yeah it's short for distribution
 

189
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,670
user yeah it's short for distribution
what distro of Linux or what flavor of

190
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
what distro of Linux or what flavor of
 

191
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,660
what distro of Linux or what flavor of
Linux are you gonna use because a lot of

192
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:09,670
Linux are you gonna use because a lot of
 

193
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,270
Linux are you gonna use because a lot of
the Linux names are based on foods that

194
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,280
the Linux names are based on foods that
 

195
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,599
the Linux names are based on foods that
is true the Atlantic's mint what flavor

196
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:15,609
is true the Atlantic's mint what flavor
 

197
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,140
is true the Atlantic's mint what flavor
mint yeah right what flavor so the

198
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,150
mint yeah right what flavor so the
 

199
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,610
mint yeah right what flavor so the
computer that I was talking about I had

200
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:20,620
computer that I was talking about I had
 

201
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,480
computer that I was talking about I had
tried a few different districts

202
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,490
tried a few different districts
 

203
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,700
tried a few different districts
I had boo bun to Matei I had also a good

204
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:27,710
I had boo bun to Matei I had also a good
 

205
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,810
I had boo bun to Matei I had also a good
option

206
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:28,820
option
 

207
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,860
option
I had Lindos from the inspire inspire

208
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:32,870
I had Lindos from the inspire inspire
 

209
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,580
I had Lindos from the inspire inspire
yeah it'll inspire no longer yeah that's

210
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:36,590
yeah it'll inspire no longer yeah that's
 

211
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,379
yeah it'll inspire no longer yeah that's
like fire but I ended up settling on a

212
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:41,389
like fire but I ended up settling on a
 

213
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,110
like fire but I ended up settling on a
Linux Mint yeah yeah and I had was it

214
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,120
Linux Mint yeah yeah and I had was it
 

215
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,960
Linux Mint yeah yeah and I had was it
Zoran Zorin OS on here yeah before I

216
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:46,970
Zoran Zorin OS on here yeah before I
 

217
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,020
Zoran Zorin OS on here yeah before I
switch to cloud ready yeah yeah okay so

218
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,030
switch to cloud ready yeah yeah okay so
 

219
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,450
switch to cloud ready yeah yeah okay so
Linux Mint for me it's a Debian based

220
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:52,460
Linux Mint for me it's a Debian based
 

221
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,010
Linux Mint for me it's a Debian based
system so this is the same core that

222
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,020
system so this is the same core that
 

223
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,070
system so this is the same core that
Ubuntu is based on right so I don't have

224
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
Ubuntu is based on right so I don't have
 

225
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,490
Ubuntu is based on right so I don't have
to and I'm a very big Debian fan all my

226
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:03,500
to and I'm a very big Debian fan all my
 

227
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,390
to and I'm a very big Debian fan all my
servers are like Debian Buster stretched

228
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,400
servers are like Debian Buster stretched
 

229
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,339
servers are like Debian Buster stretched
before that and I'm always up to date

230
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:09,349
before that and I'm always up to date
 

231
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,920
before that and I'm always up to date
with the latest in debian systems and

232
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:11,930
with the latest in debian systems and
 

233
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,339
with the latest in debian systems and
and and so and I run stable I don't tend

234
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:15,349
and and so and I run stable I don't tend
 

235
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,560
and and so and I run stable I don't tend
to run testing unless it's its feature

236
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,570
to run testing unless it's its feature
 

237
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,710
to run testing unless it's its feature
locked and ready to go into stable and

238
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
locked and ready to go into stable and
 

239
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,659
locked and ready to go into stable and
what that means again if you're new to

240
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:22,669
what that means again if you're new to
 

241
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,860
what that means again if you're new to
the Linux world Debian is basically if

242
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:26,870
the Linux world Debian is basically if
 

243
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,140
the Linux world Debian is basically if
there's a hierarchy so you've got like

244
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,150
there's a hierarchy so you've got like
 

245
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,659
there's a hierarchy so you've got like
Debian you've got Red Hat you've got a

246
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:31,669
Debian you've got Red Hat you've got a
 

247
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,159
Debian you've got Red Hat you've got a
couple other ones as well but those are

248
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,169
couple other ones as well but those are
 

249
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,230
couple other ones as well but those are
kind of the big ones that I think you're

250
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,240
kind of the big ones that I think you're
 

251
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,210
kind of the big ones that I think you're
going to encounter we don't need to

252
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,220
going to encounter we don't need to
 

253
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,219
going to encounter we don't need to
really clutter the landscape but so

254
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:39,229
really clutter the landscape but so
 

255
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,710
really clutter the landscape but so
Debian being one that it's gonna be

256
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:41,720
Debian being one that it's gonna be
 

257
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Debian being one that it's gonna be
based on it could be a boon - it could

258
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,370
based on it could be a boon - it could
 

259
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,420
based on it could be a boon - it could
be Linux Mint it could be any number you

260
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:46,430
be Linux Mint it could be any number you
 

261
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,149
be Linux Mint it could be any number you
mentioned a boon to matei another one

262
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:48,159
mentioned a boon to matei another one
 

263
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,589
mentioned a boon to matei another one
which is essentially Ubuntu with a

264
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:50,599
which is essentially Ubuntu with a
 

265
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,930
which is essentially Ubuntu with a
different interface yes has Mattei is

266
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:52,940
different interface yes has Mattei is
 

267
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,390
different interface yes has Mattei is
like the menu the the desktop

268
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,400
like the menu the the desktop
 

269
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,080
like the menu the the desktop
environment

270
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,090
environment
 

271
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,999
environment
so now linux mint is also Mattei but

272
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:01,009
so now linux mint is also Mattei but
 

273
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,700
so now linux mint is also Mattei but
it's it's based on a boon - correct

274
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:03,710
it's it's based on a boon - correct
 

275
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,939
it's it's based on a boon - correct
all right so it's like this whole it's

276
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:06,949
all right so it's like this whole it's
 

277
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,629
all right so it's like this whole it's
like this tree of hierarchy of where did

278
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
like this tree of hierarchy of where did
 

279
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,700
like this tree of hierarchy of where did
this Linux come from so you've got

280
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:12,710
this Linux come from so you've got
 

281
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,010
this Linux come from so you've got
Debian is like this fantastic server

282
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,020
Debian is like this fantastic server
 

283
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,290
Debian is like this fantastic server
environment but then a boon to canonical

284
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,300
environment but then a boon to canonical
 

285
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,589
environment but then a boon to canonical
is creating a desktop version of that

286
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:20,599
is creating a desktop version of that
 

287
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,629
is creating a desktop version of that
and it's fantastic it's called a boon -

288
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
and it's fantastic it's called a boon -
 

289
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,730
and it's fantastic it's called a boon -
and that's where a boon - Matei comes

290
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:24,740
and that's where a boon - Matei comes
 

291
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,800
and that's where a boon - Matei comes
from and then you've got Linux Mint

292
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:26,810
from and then you've got Linux Mint
 

293
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,409
from and then you've got Linux Mint
which is a fork of that another word for

294
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:29,419
which is a fork of that another word for
 

295
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,620
which is a fork of that another word for
yeah it's like they copied the code base

296
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:32,630
yeah it's like they copied the code base
 

297
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,940
yeah it's like they copied the code base
and then they've tweaked it and made it

298
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:33,950
and then they've tweaked it and made it
 

299
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,750
and then they've tweaked it and made it
the way that they want it and

300
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:35,760
the way that they want it and
 

301
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,250
the way that they want it and
that's the one that I've settled on and

302
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,260
that's the one that I've settled on and
 

303
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,860
that's the one that I've settled on and
it's fantastic so I get all the benefits

304
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:39,870
it's fantastic so I get all the benefits
 

305
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,230
it's fantastic so I get all the benefits
of Debian I get the benefits of Ubuntu

306
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
of Debian I get the benefits of Ubuntu
 

307
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,600
of Debian I get the benefits of Ubuntu
and I get the benefits of the Linux Mint

308
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,610
and I get the benefits of the Linux Mint
 

309
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,540
and I get the benefits of the Linux Mint
community as well and so I end up with

310
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:47,550
community as well and so I end up with
 

311
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,000
community as well and so I end up with
this extremely polished desktop

312
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,010
this extremely polished desktop
 

313
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,430
this extremely polished desktop
operating system that will run on my old

314
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,440
operating system that will run on my old
 

315
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
operating system that will run on my old
hardware that I don't have to upgrade

316
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,450
hardware that I don't have to upgrade
 

317
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,150
hardware that I don't have to upgrade
the RAM that I don't have to buy a new

318
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
the RAM that I don't have to buy a new
 

319
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,300
the RAM that I don't have to buy a new
SSD and it works fantastically in it and

320
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,310
SSD and it works fantastically in it and
 

321
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,340
SSD and it works fantastically in it and
it's fairly familiar I don't have to

322
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,350
it's fairly familiar I don't have to
 

323
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,190
it's fairly familiar I don't have to
relearn the entire desktop paradigm in

324
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,200
relearn the entire desktop paradigm in
 

325
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
relearn the entire desktop paradigm in
order to get used to it pretty intuitive

326
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,210
order to get used to it pretty intuitive
 

327
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,500
order to get used to it pretty intuitive
like I carry yeah yeah now you talked

328
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:09,510
like I carry yeah yeah now you talked
 

329
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,750
like I carry yeah yeah now you talked
about stable version versus yes

330
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:11,760
about stable version versus yes
 

331
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,750
about stable version versus yes
experimental I think was test yeah so

332
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:14,760
experimental I think was test yeah so
 

333
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,330
experimental I think was test yeah so
for somebody who's sit just getting into

334
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:17,340
for somebody who's sit just getting into
 

335
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,740
for somebody who's sit just getting into
this and they're like oh I downloaded

336
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:18,750
this and they're like oh I downloaded
 

337
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,870
this and they're like oh I downloaded
the experimental what's the pitfall to

338
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
the experimental what's the pitfall to
 

339
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,960
the experimental what's the pitfall to
experimental versus stable for them

340
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:22,970
experimental versus stable for them
 

341
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,990
experimental versus stable for them
testing or CID is what Debian calls it

342
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,000
testing or CID is what Debian calls it
 

343
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,630
testing or CID is what Debian calls it
so way up at the higher level of the

344
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:29,640
so way up at the higher level of the
 

345
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,280
so way up at the higher level of the
hierarchy which you're probably not

346
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,290
hierarchy which you're probably not
 

347
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,020
hierarchy which you're probably not
going to touch as a new Linux user okay

348
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,030
going to touch as a new Linux user okay
 

349
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,420
going to touch as a new Linux user okay
so remember that Debian is like up here

350
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,430
so remember that Debian is like up here
 

351
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,330
so remember that Debian is like up here
okay so Sid is a testing version of

352
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,340
okay so Sid is a testing version of
 

353
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,260
okay so Sid is a testing version of
Debian stable is is what they consider

354
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,270
Debian stable is is what they consider
 

355
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,450
Debian stable is is what they consider
stable it's been tested okay so it's

356
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,460
stable it's been tested okay so it's
 

357
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,560
stable it's been tested okay so it's
already gone through the testing phase

358
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,570
already gone through the testing phase
 

359
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,930
already gone through the testing phase
if you were going up here going to

360
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:47,940
if you were going up here going to
 

361
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,430
if you were going up here going to
testing is going to end up giving you

362
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
testing is going to end up giving you
 

363
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,460
testing is going to end up giving you
newer packages so like when the new

364
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:52,470
newer packages so like when the new
 

365
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,470
newer packages so like when the new
version of comes out GNU image

366
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:54,480
version of comes out GNU image
 

367
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
version of comes out GNU image
manipulation program you're gonna have

368
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,490
manipulation program you're gonna have
 

369
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,680
manipulation program you're gonna have
the latest and greatest right

370
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:57,690
the latest and greatest right
 

371
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,990
the latest and greatest right
immediately part of the operating system

372
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
immediately part of the operating system
 

373
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,320
immediately part of the operating system
but it may not be stable it may crash it

374
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,330
but it may not be stable it may crash it
 

375
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,000
but it may not be stable it may crash it
may have bugs and that kind of stuff

376
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,010
may have bugs and that kind of stuff
 

377
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,320
may have bugs and that kind of stuff
because it hasn't gone through that

378
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,330
because it hasn't gone through that
 

379
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,280
because it hasn't gone through that
testing phase yet once it hits stable

380
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,290
testing phase yet once it hits stable
 

381
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,870
testing phase yet once it hits stable
Ubuntu users would say it's older

382
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:11,880
Ubuntu users would say it's older
 

383
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,170
Ubuntu users would say it's older
version right right Debian users will

384
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,180
version right right Debian users will
 

385
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,200
version right right Debian users will
say it's stable yeah it doesn't crash it

386
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,210
say it's stable yeah it doesn't crash it
 

387
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,120
say it's stable yeah it doesn't crash it
doesn't have any problems okay so that's

388
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,130
doesn't have any problems okay so that's
 

389
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,950
doesn't have any problems okay so that's
a big difference between a boon to and

390
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
a big difference between a boon to and
 

391
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,770
a big difference between a boon to and
Debian Debian stable means it's gone

392
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:24,780
Debian Debian stable means it's gone
 

393
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,190
Debian Debian stable means it's gone
through a lengthy maybe two-year testing

394
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,200
through a lengthy maybe two-year testing
 

395
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,500
through a lengthy maybe two-year testing
process like proofreaders but are using

399
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,469
it ready to get is safe to use that's
stable okay so it's rock-solid

400
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
stable okay so it's rock-solid
 

401
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,060
stable okay so it's rock-solid
whoo boon to a little more bleeding edge

402
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,070
whoo boon to a little more bleeding edge
 

403
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,830
whoo boon to a little more bleeding edge
little more cutting edge and the

little more cutting edge and the
 

405
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,909
little more cutting edge and the
software versions are going to be a

406
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:40,919
software versions are going to be a
 

407
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,400
software versions are going to be a
little bit newer and the package

408
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,410
little bit newer and the package
 

409
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,410

managing and everything else is a little
 

411
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,950
managing and everything else is a little
bit tweaked for end-users but you're not

412
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:48,960
bit tweaked for end-users but you're not
 

413

dealing and
 

415
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,490
dealing and
with testing versus stable it's just

416
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,500
with testing versus stable it's just
 

417
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,950
with testing versus stable it's just
here's a boon to ya and that's what you

LTS any guess is what that means or is

422
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,410
LTS any guess is what that means or is
 

423
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,800
LTS any guess is what that means or is
it not LTS a lifetime service very close

424
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:05,810
it not LTS a lifetime service very close
 

425
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,390
it not LTS a lifetime service very close
long-term support long-term support yes

so LTS means that version is going to

442
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:35,340
so LTS means that version is going to
 

443
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,580
so LTS means that version is going to
continue being supported think of along

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,460
time years okay so if you're new and you
 

453
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,310
time years okay so if you're new and you
don't want to have to reinstall every

454
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:49,320
don't want to have to reinstall every
 

455
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,840
don't want to have to reinstall every
couple of years or go through the

456
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:50,850
couple of years or go through the
 

457
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,690
couple of years or go through the
upgrade process go with LTS if you like

458
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:53,700
upgrade process go with LTS if you like
 

459
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,270
upgrade process go with LTS if you like
the brand new versions go with the

460
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:56,280
the brand new versions go with the
 

461
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,490
the brand new versions go with the
current version which right now it's

462
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:58,500
current version which right now it's
 

463
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,820
current version which right now it's
2020 it's not quite April but because

464
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:01,830
2020 it's not quite April but because
 

465
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,540
2020 it's not quite April but because
it's almost April that means that 2004

466

469
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,420
is going to be coming out in April
because it represents the date right so

470
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,430
because it represents the date right so
 

471
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,480
because it represents the date right so
it's every October and April its

472
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,490
it's every October and April its
 

473
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,280
it's every October and April its
birthday in April like I do is that what

474
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,290
birthday in April like I do is that what
 

475
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,460
birthday in April like I do is that what
happens Act yes like that so the most

476
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,470
happens Act yes like that so the most
 

477
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,310
happens Act yes like that so the most
recent version then therefore would be

478
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:21,320
recent version then therefore would be
 

479
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,670
recent version then therefore would be
1910 19 point 10 so and always vary

480
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
1910 19 point 10 so and always vary
 

481
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,310
1910 19 point 10 so and always vary
somebody's mind by explaining that yeah

482
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
somebody's mind by explaining that yeah
 

483
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,470
somebody's mind by explaining that yeah
a little bit cuz I was like yeah yeah no

484
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:33,480
a little bit cuz I was like yeah yeah no
 

485
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,720
a little bit cuz I was like yeah yeah no
it's October 2019

486
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:35,730
it's October 2019
 

487
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,720
it's October 2019
so that version would be the latest

488
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:37,730
so that version would be the latest
 

489
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,220
so that version would be the latest
current version of Ubuntu but it's not

490
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,230
current version of Ubuntu but it's not
 

491
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,760
current version of Ubuntu but it's not
LTS right so you you'd have to then go

492
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:43,770
LTS right so you you'd have to then go
 

493
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,580
LTS right so you you'd have to then go
to 2004 when it's released through the

494
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:46,590
to 2004 when it's released through the
 

495
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,710
to 2004 when it's released through the
upgrade path which is pretty easy now

496
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
upgrade path which is pretty easy now
 

497
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,600
upgrade path which is pretty easy now
Linux Mint I believe subscribes to a

498
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,610
Linux Mint I believe subscribes to a
 

499
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,210
Linux Mint I believe subscribes to a
very similar model but they base theirs

500
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:53,220
very similar model but they base theirs
 

501
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,000
very similar model but they base theirs
on the LTS of Ubuntu so you're gonna get

502
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,010
on the LTS of Ubuntu so you're gonna get
 

503
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,360
on the LTS of Ubuntu so you're gonna get
LTS I believe anyway well but they have

504
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,370
LTS I believe anyway well but they have
 

505
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,570
LTS I believe anyway well but they have
the iterations throughout as well so

506
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:02,580
the iterations throughout as well so
 

507
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,150
the iterations throughout as well so
like right now it's Linux Mint 19 and I

508
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,160
like right now it's Linux Mint 19 and I
 

509
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,860
like right now it's Linux Mint 19 and I
believe nineteen point two something

510
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:06,870
believe nineteen point two something
 

511
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,960
believe nineteen point two something
like that so so it's just it's how it

512
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:08,970
like that so so it's just it's how it
 

513
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,519
like that so so it's just it's how it
trickles down so that's what I've

514
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:10,529
trickles down so that's what I've
 

515
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,740
trickles down so that's what I've
settled on is Linux Mint because I find

516
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:12,750

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:25,420
and you Jeff has mentioned something
 

621
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,639
and you Jeff has mentioned something
that we haven't talked about yet tonight

622
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:26,649
that we haven't talked about yet tonight
 

623
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:29,639
that we haven't talked about yet tonight
the dual boot dual booting so what that

624
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:29,649
the dual boot dual booting so what that
 

625
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,829
the dual boot dual booting so what that
means is that he's chosen so your

626
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
means is that he's chosen so your
 

627
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,840
means is that he's chosen so your
computer is obviously good enough to run

628
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:33,850
computer is obviously good enough to run
 

629
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,480
computer is obviously good enough to run
Windows 10 anyways yes okay so that's a

630
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,490
Windows 10 anyways yes okay so that's a
 

631
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,210
Windows 10 anyways yes okay so that's a
different scenario in some ways however

632
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:39,220
different scenario in some ways however
 

633
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,430
different scenario in some ways however
if your computer is able to support it

634
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
if your computer is able to support it
 

635
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,540
if your computer is able to support it
and you still want to go the route of

636
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:42,550
and you still want to go the route of
 

637
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,090
and you still want to go the route of
Linux yeah you can do dual booting can

638
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,100
Linux yeah you can do dual booting can
 

639
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,410
Linux yeah you can do dual booting can
you explain to us what that means yeah

640
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:46,420
you explain to us what that means yeah
 

641
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,410
you explain to us what that means yeah
so with dual boot I have partitioned the

642
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:49,420
so with dual boot I have partitioned the
 

643
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,379
so with dual boot I have partitioned the
hard drive that's a fancy word Jeff okay

644
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:52,389
hard drive that's a fancy word Jeff okay
 

645
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,509
hard drive that's a fancy word Jeff okay
so partition means I took the space of

646
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:54,519
so partition means I took the space of
 

647
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,579
so partition means I took the space of
the hard drive yeah and I segmented off

648
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:56,589
the hard drive yeah and I segmented off
 

649
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,610
the hard drive yeah and I segmented off
into different portions and so that hard

650
00:13:59,610 --> 00:13:59,620
into different portions and so that hard
 

651
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,060
into different portions and so that hard
to do

652
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,070
to do
 

653
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,370
to do
knows really have to be a straight 50/50

654
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:02,380
knows really have to be a straight 50/50
 

655
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,019
knows really have to be a straight 50/50
it does not have to be a straight 5050

656
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:04,029
it does not have to be a straight 5050
 

657
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:06,540
it does not have to be a straight 5050
and so my initial boot was not Windows

658
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:06,550
and so my initial boot was not Windows
 

659
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,230
and so my initial boot was not Windows
it was Linux so originally it was just

660
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
it was Linux so originally it was just
 

661
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,740
it was Linux so originally it was just
Linux yeah originally because it was a

662
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:13,750
Linux yeah originally because it was a
 

663
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,750
Linux yeah originally because it was a
computer I built okay so it was a blank

664
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
computer I built okay so it was a blank
 

665
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,850
computer I built okay so it was a blank
hard drive and my first install was

666
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:17,860
hard drive and my first install was
 

667
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,189
hard drive and my first install was
Linux because when I'm doing the install

668
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:20,199
Linux because when I'm doing the install
 

669
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,720
Linux because when I'm doing the install
it says do you intend to do a dual boot

670
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:21,730
it says do you intend to do a dual boot
 

671
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,300
it says do you intend to do a dual boot
and so really yep so that was one of the

672
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,310
and so really yep so that was one of the
 

673
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,800
and so really yep so that was one of the
install options and I'm like yes I

674
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:25,810
install options and I'm like yes I
 

675
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,630
install options and I'm like yes I
intend to do a dual boot and so that's

676
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:27,640
intend to do a dual boot and so that's
 

677
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,280
intend to do a dual boot and so that's
what happened is I set up the dual boot

678
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,290
what happened is I set up the dual boot
 

679
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,030
what happened is I set up the dual boot
I'm blanking on what the dual boot

680
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm blanking on what the dual boot
 

681
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm blanking on what the dual boot
program is called um gee part head no no

682
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:36,730
program is called um gee part head no no
 

683
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,930
program is called um gee part head no no
it's the Installer process yeah I'm

684
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:39,940
it's the Installer process yeah I'm
 

685
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,329
it's the Installer process yeah I'm
blanking on what it's called anyway so

686
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:42,339
blanking on what it's called anyway so
 

687
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,889
blanking on what it's called anyway so
that popped up in the install and it's

688
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:43,899
that popped up in the install and it's
 

689
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:45,300
that popped up in the install and it's
like okay how much do you want to

690
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,310
like okay how much do you want to
 

691
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,360
like okay how much do you want to
partition on your hard drive okay your

692
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,370
partition on your hard drive okay your
 

693
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,960
partition on your hard drive okay your
Linux operating yankem and so I set up

694
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:51,970
Linux operating yankem and so I set up
 

695
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,660
Linux operating yankem and so I set up
it was not quite a 50-50 split because I

696
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:54,670
it was not quite a 50-50 split because I
 

697
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,579
it was not quite a 50-50 split because I
need a ton of space for the games that

698
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:56,589
need a ton of space for the games that
 

699
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,630
need a ton of space for the games that
get installed so it was more Windows I

700
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:00,640
get installed so it was more Windows I
 

701
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,819
get installed so it was more Windows I
think it's 25/75 split ball and all in

702
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:02,829
think it's 25/75 split ball and all in
 

703
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,160
think it's 25/75 split ball and all in
the hard drive that was the first time I

704
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,170
the hard drive that was the first time I
 

705
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,600
the hard drive that was the first time I
did the install I've since wiped the

706
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,610
did the install I've since wiped the
 

707
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,470
did the install I've since wiped the
computer reinstalled it and so that was

708
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
computer reinstalled it and so that was
 

709
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,540
computer reinstalled it and so that was
when I had my spinning hard drive ok and

710
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:12,550
when I had my spinning hard drive ok and
 

711
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,120
when I had my spinning hard drive ok and
then after I installed Linux I booted up

712
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,130
then after I installed Linux I booted up
 

713
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,059
then after I installed Linux I booted up
again installing windows on the second

714
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:18,069
again installing windows on the second
 

715
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:20,310
again installing windows on the second
partition since wiping out that

716
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
partition since wiping out that
 

717
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,090
partition since wiping out that
going with my SSD it's the SSD I think

718
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,100
going with my SSD it's the SSD I think
 

719
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,250
going with my SSD it's the SSD I think
is 500 gigs and I have two terabytes

720
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,260
is 500 gigs and I have two terabytes
 

721
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,410
is 500 gigs and I have two terabytes
spinning hard drive yeah for it and so

722
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:28,420
spinning hard drive yeah for it and so
 

723
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,390
spinning hard drive yeah for it and so
that's where my data is on the spinning

724
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:30,400
that's where my data is on the spinning
 

725
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,020
that's where my data is on the spinning
hard drive yeah

726
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,030
hard drive yeah
 

727
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,460
hard drive yeah
and then I'm using the SSD for the

728
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:32,470
and then I'm using the SSD for the
 

729
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,900
and then I'm using the SSD for the
operating system and that's a 50/50

730
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:33,910
operating system and that's a 50/50
 

731
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,830
operating system and that's a 50/50
split okay

732
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:34,840
split okay
 

733
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,790
split okay
very complicated sounding but it's by

734
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
very complicated sounding but it's by
 

735
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
very complicated sounding but it's by
taut but from the scenario of a user who

736
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,250
taut but from the scenario of a user who
 

737
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,530
taut but from the scenario of a user who
say is using Windows and wants to

738
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:45,540
say is using Windows and wants to
 

739
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,510
say is using Windows and wants to
experience Linux and and and use Linux

740
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:48,520
experience Linux and and and use Linux
 

741
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,580
experience Linux and and and use Linux
because it's safer because I know I can

742
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:50,590
because it's safer because I know I can
 

743
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,200
because it's safer because I know I can
surf the Internet my kids can use the

744
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,210
surf the Internet my kids can use the
 

745
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,760
surf the Internet my kids can use the
computer I don't have to worry about

746
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:53,770
computer I don't have to worry about
 

747
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,950
computer I don't have to worry about
viruses like I do with Windows those

748
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:55,960
viruses like I do with Windows those
 

749
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,010
viruses like I do with Windows those
kinds of things so let's say your kids

750
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,020
kinds of things so let's say your kids
 

751
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,620
kinds of things so let's say your kids
sit down at the computer and they want

752
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:01,630
sit down at the computer and they want
 

753
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,750
sit down at the computer and they want
to switch between Windows and Linux or

754
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:03,760
to switch between Windows and Linux or
 

755
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,360
to switch between Windows and Linux or
vice-versa how is that process so all we

756
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,370
vice-versa how is that process so all we
 

757
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,600
vice-versa how is that process so all we
have to do is we if I'm in Windows we go

758
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:09,610
have to do is we if I'm in Windows we go
 

759
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,310
have to do is we if I'm in Windows we go
through a system restart and then on the

760
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:11,320
through a system restart and then on the
 

761
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
through a system restart and then on the
boot it brings up the dual boot screen

762
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,330
boot it brings up the dual boot screen
 

763
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,050
boot it brings up the dual boot screen
the default if the computer just starts

764
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,060
the default if the computer just starts
 

765
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,800
the default if the computer just starts
up by itself

766
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:16,810
up by itself
 

767
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,590
up by itself
yeah is to go into Linux yes I wanted to

768
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
yeah is to go into Linux yes I wanted to
 

769
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,780
yeah is to go into Linux yes I wanted to
go into Linux automatically if say

770
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:21,790
go into Linux automatically if say
 

771
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,070
go into Linux automatically if say
Windows does a system update in the

772
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,080
Windows does a system update in the
 

773
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,390
Windows does a system update in the
middle of the night or something right
