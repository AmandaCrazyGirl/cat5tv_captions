was to give myself more of a challenge
 

47
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,760
was to give myself more of a challenge
without really affecting the people

without affecting are you talking about
 

53
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,969
without affecting are you talking about
being benign in your attacks so that

54
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:28,979
being benign in your attacks so that
 

55
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,050
being benign in your attacks so that
you're not actually creating damage

high school is when I realized hey I can
 

105
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,069
high school is when I realized hey I can
hack systems and I can make them do what

hack systems and I can make them do what

when was that point for you probably

116
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:06,799
when was that point for you probably
 

117
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,059
when was that point for you probably
around ten or eleven I'd say when I

around ten or eleven I'd say when I
 

119
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,539
around ten or eleven I'd say when I
started when a lot of people on the

120
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:13,549
started when a lot of people on the
 

121
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,719
started when a lot of people on the
internet started coming out and trying

122
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:15,729
internet started coming out and trying
 

123
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,250
internet started coming out and trying
to the public like what you can do with

124
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,260
to the public like what you can do with
 

125
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,680
to the public like what you can do with
this and how everything can be explained

126
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,690
this and how everything can be explained
 

127
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:27,629
this and how everything can be explained
I thought I wanted to learn that ability

128
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:27,639
I thought I wanted to learn that ability
 

129
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,599
I thought I wanted to learn that ability
more so for good about okay so you know

130
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:34,609
more so for good about okay so you know
 

131
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,280
more so for good about okay so you know
and these devices you mentioned printers

132
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,290
and these devices you mentioned printers
 

133
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,479
and these devices you mentioned printers
and we're gonna talk more about that but

134
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:37,489
and we're gonna talk more about that but
 

135
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,469
and we're gonna talk more about that but
these devices are benign considered safe

136
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:41,479
these devices are benign considered safe
 

137
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,749
these devices are benign considered safe
these are these are devices that people

138
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:43,759
these are these are devices that people
 

139
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,629
these are these are devices that people
trust to plug into their network I mean

140
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:46,639
trust to plug into their network I mean
 

141
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,520
trust to plug into their network I mean
you walk into any super Center you buy a

142
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,530
you walk into any super Center you buy a
 

143
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,140
you walk into any super Center you buy a
printer and you install it and it just

144
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,150
printer and you install it and it just
 

145
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,589
printer and you install it and it just
works

146
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:50,599
works
 

147
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,999
works
yeah what is it that drew you to start

148
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:55,009
yeah what is it that drew you to start
 

149
00:03:55,009 --> 00:04:04,479
yeah what is it that drew you to start
attacking those devices a little bit

150
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:04,489
attacking those devices a little bit
 

151
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,330
attacking those devices a little bit
easier of an access then a more

152
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,340
easier of an access then a more
 

153
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,659
easier of an access then a more
sophisticated system so it was easy

154
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:10,669
sophisticated system so it was easy
 

155
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:14,229
sophisticated system so it was easy
enough for each of you but just don't

156
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
enough for each of you but just don't
 

157
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,140
enough for each of you but just don't
have a challenge and a large amount to

158
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,150
have a challenge and a large amount to
 

159
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,729
have a challenge and a large amount to
bomb like a surplus of pincers on up and

bomb like a surplus of pincers on up and
 

161
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:22,090
bomb like a surplus of pincers on up and
you

162
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,100
you
 

163
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,670
you
then network so you know you're I have a

164
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
then network so you know you're I have a
 

165
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,170
then network so you know you're I have a
lot of access to them and it made it a

166
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,180
lot of access to them and it made it a
 

167
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,180
lot of access to them and it made it a
little bit easier sorry I'm kind of

168
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,190
little bit easier sorry I'm kind of
 

169
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,720
little bit easier sorry I'm kind of
tracker no not at all not at all so but

170
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:37,730
tracker no not at all not at all so but
 

171
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,640
tracker no not at all not at all so but
it makes me think though and we're

172
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:39,650
it makes me think though and we're
 

173
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,520
it makes me think though and we're
speaking with the Canadian hacker here

174
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,530
speaking with the Canadian hacker here
 

175
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,650
speaking with the Canadian hacker here
the Canadian hacker we know you by no

176
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:44,660
the Canadian hacker we know you by no
 

177
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,620
the Canadian hacker we know you by no
other name when you're attacking

178
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:47,630
other name when you're attacking
 

179
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,910
other name when you're attacking
printers so so I think as a consoled me

180
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:51,920
printers so so I think as a consoled me
 

181
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,400
printers so so I think as a consoled me
as a consumer or our viewers as

182
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,410
as a consumer or our viewers as
 

183
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,430
as a consumer or our viewers as
consumers will purchase a printer and

184
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
consumers will purchase a printer and
 

185
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,380
consumers will purchase a printer and
just install it on their network so what

186
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,390
just install it on their network so what
 

187
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,860
just install it on their network so what
makes that device a vulnerable device

188
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:02,870
makes that device a vulnerable device
 

189
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,230
makes that device a vulnerable device
you just think it's a benign device just

190
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,240
you just think it's a benign device just
 

191
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,840
you just think it's a benign device just
sitting on your network that you print -

192
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:06,850
sitting on your network that you print -
 

193
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,350
sitting on your network that you print -
well how are we able to attack that how

194
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
well how are we able to attack that how
 

195
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,990
well how are we able to attack that how
what is what is it that I should know as

196
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
what is what is it that I should know as
 

197
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,900
what is what is it that I should know as
a consumer that you can share with me as

198
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:16,910
a consumer that you can share with me as
 

199
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,570
a consumer that you can share with me as
a hacker that I should know about that

200
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:19,580
a hacker that I should know about that
 

201
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,240
a hacker that I should know about that
printer being connected to my network

202
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,250

 

203
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,070

like security feeder I guess you can say

204
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,080
like security feeder I guess you can say
 

205
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,770
like security feeder I guess you can say
um you might think that they're safe

206
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:29,780
um you might think that they're safe
 

207
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,140
um you might think that they're safe
when they really truly not and for

208
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,150
when they really truly not and for
 

209
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,360
when they really truly not and for
printers in this case um there's a lot

210
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,370
printers in this case um there's a lot
 

211
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,840
printers in this case um there's a lot
of it's on your network that it can be

212
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:37,850
of it's on your network that it can be
 

213
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,850
of it's on your network that it can be
accessed with which I don't mean that

214
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:39,860
accessed with which I don't mean that
 

215
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,160
accessed with which I don't mean that
you don't you shouldn't connected to

216
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,170
you don't you shouldn't connected to
 

217
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,810
you don't you shouldn't connected to
your network I mean it makes it so much

218
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:43,820
your network I mean it makes it so much
 

219
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,480
your network I mean it makes it so much
easier to think anything else but you

220
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,490
easier to think anything else but you
 

221
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,890
easier to think anything else but you
just have to be really careful with

222
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:47,900
just have to be really careful with
 

223
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,150
just have to be really careful with
what's exposed because there's outputs

224
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
what's exposed because there's outputs
 

225
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,760
what's exposed because there's outputs
ninety one hundred five one five and six

226
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:54,770
ninety one hundred five one five and six
 

227
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,980
ninety one hundred five one five and six
three one which is the main three ports

228
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:56,990
three one which is the main three ports
 

229
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,760
three one which is the main three ports
that then it's mainly ninety one hundred

230
00:05:59,760 --> 00:05:59,770
that then it's mainly ninety one hundred
 

231
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,710
that then it's mainly ninety one hundred
six three one isn't that cups yeah so

232
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:05,720
six three one isn't that cups yeah so
 

233
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,560
six three one isn't that cups yeah so
you gotta be really careful with thumb

234
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:08,570
you gotta be really careful with thumb
 

235
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,460
you gotta be really careful with thumb
what you're exposing um and you just

236
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,470
what you're exposing um and you just
 

237
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,890
what you're exposing um and you just
always not be watching out with what

238
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:14,900
always not be watching out with what
 

239
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,150
always not be watching out with what
you're installing to hear about what

240
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
you're installing to hear about what
 

241
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,220
you're installing to hear about what
were you're adding to network cuz I

242
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,230
were you're adding to network cuz I
 

243
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,120
were you're adding to network cuz I
guess I could get into that venture and

244
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,130
guess I could get into that venture and
 

245
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,250
guess I could get into that venture and
if I wanted to attack it for malicious

246
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,260
if I wanted to attack it for malicious
 

247
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,220
if I wanted to attack it for malicious
reasons on the theory large business I

248
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,230
reasons on the theory large business I
 

249
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,380
reasons on the theory large business I
could anything you print off finance

250
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,390
could anything you print off finance
 

251
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,700
could anything you print off finance
reports or anything

252
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:30,710
reports or anything
 

253
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,659
reports or anything
I would actually be able to use a man

254
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:34,669
I would actually be able to use a man
 

255
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,790
I would actually be able to use a man
and she drops solaar and she really have

256
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:39,800
and she drops solaar and she really have
 

257
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,339
and she drops solaar and she really have
to be careful with what you're putting

258
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:42,349
to be careful with what you're putting
 

259
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,890
to be careful with what you're putting
or connecting to your network and you

260
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:44,900
or connecting to your network and you
 

261
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,540
or connecting to your network and you
should always be checking on your

262
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,550
should always be checking on your
 

263
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,129
should always be checking on your
settings on your modem or I mean people

264
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:51,139
settings on your modem or I mean people
 

265
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,629
settings on your modem or I mean people
know this router but it's really holding

266
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
know this router but it's really holding
 

267
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,559
know this router but it's really holding
rate on to see what ports your long to

268
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:56,569
rate on to see what ports your long to
 

269
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,980
rate on to see what ports your long to
pass through the network and that makes

270
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,990
pass through the network and that makes
 

271
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,749
pass through the network and that makes
me think now the Canadian hacker you're

272
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
me think now the Canadian hacker you're
 

273
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,279
me think now the Canadian hacker you're
dropping a bunch of bombs here so I got

274
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:03,289
dropping a bunch of bombs here so I got
 

275
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,779
dropping a bunch of bombs here so I got
to cut you off because like okay and we

276
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:04,789
to cut you off because like okay and we
 

277
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,119
to cut you off because like okay and we
got to talk about this UPnP is enabled

278
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:07,129
got to talk about this UPnP is enabled
 

279
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,240
got to talk about this UPnP is enabled
on a lot of routers you UPnP means as

280
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,250
on a lot of routers you UPnP means as
 

281
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,339
on a lot of routers you UPnP means as
soon as you plug that printer in it

282
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:12,349
soon as you plug that printer in it
 

283
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,409
soon as you plug that printer in it
opens up the ports it doesn't matter if

284
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:14,419
opens up the ports it doesn't matter if
 

285
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,140
opens up the ports it doesn't matter if
you specifically said open up those

286
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,150
you specifically said open up those
 

287
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,719
you specifically said open up those
ports no UPnP will automatically do that

288
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:19,729
ports no UPnP will automatically do that
 

289
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,300
ports no UPnP will automatically do that
because it detects the new printer and

290
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,310
because it detects the new printer and
 

291
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,850
because it detects the new printer and
allows it to open those ports

292
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:24,860
allows it to open those ports
 

293
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,860
allows it to open those ports
automatically that's dangerous that's

294
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:26,870
automatically that's dangerous that's
 

295
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,390
automatically that's dangerous that's
what I'm learning here but you're

296
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
what I'm learning here but you're
 

297
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,399
what I'm learning here but you're
talking about okay not only are you able

298
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:30,409
talking about okay not only are you able
 

299
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,320
talking about okay not only are you able
to send print jobs to my printer but

300
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,330
to send print jobs to my printer but
 

301
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,589
to send print jobs to my printer but
you're able to intercept the print jobs

302
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:38,599
you're able to intercept the print jobs
 

303
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,879
you're able to intercept the print jobs
that I send to my printer exactly yeah

304
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:42,889
that I send to my printer exactly yeah
 

305
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,209
that I send to my printer exactly yeah
and you can see how interest is and a

306
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:49,219
and you can see how interest is and a
 

307
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,519
and you can see how interest is and a
lot of the security features on printers

308
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:51,529
lot of the security features on printers
 

309
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:54,249
lot of the security features on printers
that say like only our men will be saved

310
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:54,259
that say like only our men will be saved
 

311
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:56,770
that say like only our men will be saved
on the system or anything like that um

faster it's gonna be better and you
 

479
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,319
faster it's gonna be better and you
don't ever think twice about the

480
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:16,329
don't ever think twice about the
 

481
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:18,660
don't ever think twice about the
security of that device what what does

482
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:18,670
security of that device what what does
 

483
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,629
security of that device what what does
it open up to a hacker such as yourself

484
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:21,639
it open up to a hacker such as yourself
 

485
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,939
it open up to a hacker such as yourself
now I understand that you're taking the

486
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:23,949
now I understand that you're taking the
 

487
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,379
now I understand that you're taking the
you're taking the high road

488
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:25,389
you're taking the high road
 

489
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,379
you're taking the high road
and saying you know I'm gonna educate

490
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:28,389
and saying you know I'm gonna educate
 

491
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,980
and saying you know I'm gonna educate
people but what about those hackers that

492
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:31,990
people but what about those hackers that
 

493
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,990
people but what about those hackers that
are saying no I'm gonna exploit people

494
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,000

 

495
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,699

that's very good question I'm just gonna

496
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:41,709
that's very good question I'm just gonna
 

497
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,640
that's very good question I'm just gonna
put that on their own

498
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:43,650
put that on their own
 

499
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,000
put that on their own
it is truly astonishing what you can do

500
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,010
it is truly astonishing what you can do
 

501
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,870
it is truly astonishing what you can do
when you have access to these systems

502
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:49,880
when you have access to these systems
 

503
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,850
when you have access to these systems
like you said I mean I believe that's

504
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:52,860
like you said I mean I believe that's
 

505
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,560
like you said I mean I believe that's
our DP current yeah yeah so figure out

506
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:57,570
our DP current yeah yeah so figure out
 

507
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,840
our DP current yeah yeah so figure out
that one you most likely chap you need

508
00:12:59,840 --> 00:12:59,850
that one you most likely chap you need
 

509
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,540
that one you most likely chap you need
to have that one enabled but there's so

510
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:02,550
to have that one enabled but there's so
 

511
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,100
to have that one enabled but there's so
many exploits with this and a modem you

512
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,110
many exploits with this and a modem you
 

513
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,380
many exploits with this and a modem you
know you'll be able just in most cases

514
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,390
know you'll be able just in most cases
 

515
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,960
know you'll be able just in most cases
you can see what is installed on the

you can see what is installed on the
 

517
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,829
you can see what is installed on the

519
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,530

IP address and you can find

520
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:18,540
IP address and you can find
 

521
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,180

can access it yourself even if you
 

543
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,750
can access it yourself even if you
weren't able to before can I didn't put

544
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
weren't able to before can I didn't put
 

545
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,370
weren't able to before can I didn't put
something out there because you touched

546
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:55,380
something out there because you touched
 

547
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,530

on thermostats here the Canadian hacker

548
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:57,540
on thermostats here the Canadian hacker
 

549
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,280
on thermostats here the Canadian hacker
I could also as a hacker monitor that

550
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,290
I could also as a hacker monitor that
 

551
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,680
I could also as a hacker monitor that
thermostat and see when the people are

552
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:03,690
thermostat and see when the people are
 

553
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,600
thermostat and see when the people are
coming and going so then it brings it

554
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:05,610
coming and going so then it brings it
 

555
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,850
coming and going so then it brings it
into a physical realm of saying okay

556
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:07,860
into a physical realm of saying okay
 

557

well my nest thermostat tells whoever

558
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
well my nest thermostat tells whoever
 

559
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,710
well my nest thermostat tells whoever
has access to it whether I'm home or not

has access to it whether I'm home or not
 

561
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,740
has access to it whether I'm home or not
yeah so what if I was a physical robber

562
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,750
yeah so what if I was a physical robber
 

563
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:25,640
yeah so what if I was a physical robber
it's definitely a scary world for a lot

564
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:25,650
it's definitely a scary world for a lot
