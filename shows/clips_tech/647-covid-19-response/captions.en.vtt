like we had a hundred up down which was
 

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
like we had a hundred up down which was

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:56.710 align:start position:0%
enough to kind of get it going and
 

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%

that's<00:17:56.909><c> being</c><00:17:57.909><c> expanded</c><00:17:58.299><c> to</c><00:17:58.510><c> get</c><00:17:58.720><c> even</c><00:17:58.929><c> faster</c>

00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.350 align:start position:0%
that's being expanded to get even faster
 

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's being expanded to get even faster
