going to turn a part of the house into a

going to turn a part of the house into a
studio<00:24:59.230><c> and</c><00:24:59.790><c> so</c><00:25:00.790><c> I'll</c><00:25:00.940><c> be</c><00:25:01.120><c> able</c><00:25:01.210><c> to</c><00:25:01.360><c> connect</c>

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:02.020 align:start position:0%
studio and so I'll be able to connect
 

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.270 align:start position:0%
studio and so I'll be able to connect
remotely<00:25:02.470><c> just</c><00:25:03.220><c> as</c><00:25:03.370><c> we're</c><00:25:03.550><c> doing</c><00:25:03.880><c> now</c><00:25:04.060><c> and</c><00:25:04.510><c> I</c>

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
remotely just as we're doing now and I
 

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.390 align:start position:0%
remotely just as we're doing now and I
mean<00:25:06.280><c> it'll</c><00:25:07.240><c> be</c><00:25:07.600><c> a</c><00:25:08.020><c> different</c><00:25:09.010><c> time</c><00:25:09.370><c> zone</c>

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
mean it'll be a different time zone
 

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.530 align:start position:0%
mean it'll be a different time zone
which<00:25:10.030><c> I</c><00:25:10.210><c> understand</c><00:25:10.800><c> but</c><00:25:11.850><c> I'll</c><00:25:12.850><c> have</c><00:25:13.150><c> to</c><00:25:13.180><c> get</c>

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:13.540 align:start position:0%
