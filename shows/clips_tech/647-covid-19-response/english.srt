experiments in the fact that we were

1104
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:43,840
experiments in the fact that we were
 

1105
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,350
experiments in the fact that we were
between studios and then we are in a

1106
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,360
between studios and then we are in a
 

1107
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,480

pandemic yeah and we have to be
 

1109
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,750
pandemic yeah and we have to be
physically distant because now as a part

1110
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
physically distant because now as a part
 

1111
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,820
physically distant because now as a part
of the show in order to maintain you

1112
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:53,830
of the show in order to maintain you
 

1113
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,180
of the show in order to maintain you
know the connections I've made I am

1114
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,190
know the connections I've made I am
 

1115
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,860
know the connections I've made I am
going to turn a part of the house into a

1116
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:58,870
going to turn a part of the house into a
 

1117
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,010
going to turn a part of the house into a
studio and so I'll be able to connect

1118
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,020
studio and so I'll be able to connect
 

1119
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,270
studio and so I'll be able to connect
remotely just as we're doing now and I

1120
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,280
remotely just as we're doing now and I
 

1121
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,390
remotely just as we're doing now and I
mean it'll be a different time zone

1122
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:09,400
mean it'll be a different time zone

1451
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,970
standpoint there's not really a whole
lot we can view other than prepare to

1452
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:41,980
lot we can view other than prepare to
 

1453
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,780
lot we can view other than prepare to
work from home - we raised our children

1454
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:44,790
work from home - we raised our children
 

1455
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,300
work from home - we raised our children
in a home school environment so so as

1456
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,310
in a home school environment so so as
 

1457
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,440
in a home school environment so so as
far our children are already out of that

1458
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,450
far our children are already out of that
 

1459
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,830
far our children are already out of that
past that so it would not have made much

1460
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:55,840
past that so it would not have made much
 

1461
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,240
past that so it would not have made much
difference for us from a schooling

1462
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,250
difference for us from a schooling
 

1463
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,920
difference for us from a schooling
perspective but I can see how for a lot

1464
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:58,930
perspective but I can see how for a lot
 

1465
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,660
perspective but I can see how for a lot
of people it's it's making a huge

1466
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:00,670
of people it's it's making a huge
 

1467
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,320
of people it's it's making a huge
difference and I'm hoping that it gives

1468
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,330
difference and I'm hoping that it gives
 

1469
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,490
difference and I'm hoping that it gives
people more time with their children

1470
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:05,500
