the high-end features you've got to pay
 

49
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,380
the high-end features you've got to pay
through the teeth sometimes for

50
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,390
through the teeth sometimes for
 

51
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,420
through the teeth sometimes for
licensing to be able to unlock those

what even if you buy our forty dollar

58
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,210
what even if you buy our forty dollar
 

59

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,350
access to everything so the only
 

65
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,530
access to everything so the only
limitation that you have with a micro

66
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,540
limitation that you have with a micro
 

67
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,270

tech is the hardware lucky for us they

68
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
tech is the hardware lucky for us they
 

69
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,469
tech is the hardware lucky for us they
have a gajillion of these kind of

70
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,479
have a gajillion of these kind of
 

71
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,130
have a gajillion of these kind of
devices they've got a a wide range of

72
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,140
devices they've got a a wide range of
 

73
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,240
devices they've got a a wide range of
hardware available to us so with micro

74
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,250
hardware available to us so with micro
 

75
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,959
hardware available to us so with micro
tech the approach is instead to simply

76
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:02,969
tech the approach is instead to simply
 

77
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,060
tech the approach is instead to simply
find the hardware that's going to meet

78
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,070
find the hardware that's going to meet
 

79
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,609
find the hardware that's going to meet
your needs so the reason that I've

80
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:07,619
your needs so the reason that I've
 

81
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,380
your needs so the reason that I've
selected this one for the studio is

82
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,390
selected this one for the studio is
 

83
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,130
selected this one for the studio is
because we have

84
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,140
because we have
 

85
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,580
because we have
one two three four Gigabit Ethernet

86
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:14,590
one two three four Gigabit Ethernet
 

87
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:22,660
one two three four Gigabit Ethernet
ports we've got a gig port for

88
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:22,670
ports we've got a gig port for
 

89
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,250
ports we've got a gig port for
connecting uplink to our modem it's got

90
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,260
connecting uplink to our modem it's got
 

91
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,979
connecting uplink to our modem it's got
two point four and five gigahertz radios

92
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:29,989
two point four and five gigahertz radios
 

93
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,350
two point four and five gigahertz radios
so I'm gonna be able to kind of branch

94
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,360
so I'm gonna be able to kind of branch
 

95
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,530
so I'm gonna be able to kind of branch
out and you know like our wise cams for

96
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:35,540
out and you know like our wise cams for
 

97
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,259
out and you know like our wise cams for
example are on the 2.4 gigahertz band so

98
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:38,269
example are on the 2.4 gigahertz band so
 

99
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:39,820
example are on the 2.4 gigahertz band so
I'll leave those there but I want to

100
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:39,830
I'll leave those there but I want to
 

101
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,460
I'll leave those there but I want to
bring my smart phone and our laptops and

102
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:42,470
bring my smart phone and our laptops and
 

103
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,140
bring my smart phone and our laptops and
everything over to 5 gigahertz because

104
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,150
everything over to 5 gigahertz because
 

105
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,539
everything over to 5 gigahertz because
we're gonna get more speed and then

106
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:46,549
we're gonna get more speed and then
 

107
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,430
we're gonna get more speed and then
we're gonna presumably be able to free

108
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,440
we're gonna presumably be able to free
 

109
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,449
we're gonna presumably be able to free
up that that 2.4 gigahertz band here at

110
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:52,459
up that that 2.4 gigahertz band here at
 

111
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,850
up that that 2.4 gigahertz band here at
the studio there are a couple of

112
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:54,860
the studio there are a couple of
 

113
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,229
the studio there are a couple of
different things that are really really

114
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
different things that are really really
 

115
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,729
different things that are really really
neat about this device I mean they are

116
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:57,739
neat about this device I mean they are
 

117
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,150
neat about this device I mean they are
really really hardcore good quality but

118
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,160
really really hardcore good quality but
 

119
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,940
really really hardcore good quality but
they are about 1/10 of what you would

120
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:03,950
they are about 1/10 of what you would
 

121
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,479
they are about 1/10 of what you would
expect to pay for similar features and I

122
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:07,489
expect to pay for similar features and I
 

123
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,880
expect to pay for similar features and I
really really mean that I mean you'll

124
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:09,890
really really mean that I mean you'll
 

125
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,680
really really mean that I mean you'll
notice on the side there's a USB port

126
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,690
notice on the side there's a USB port
 

127
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,289
notice on the side there's a USB port
one of the first things that I ever did

128
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:14,299
one of the first things that I ever did
 

129
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,250
one of the first things that I ever did
with a router board is I used that USB

130
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,260
with a router board is I used that USB
 

131
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,680
with a router board is I used that USB
port which by software because it's not

132
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,690
port which by software because it's not
 

133
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,860
port which by software because it's not
limited remember so I wrote a script

134
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:23,870
limited remember so I wrote a script
 

135
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,009
limited remember so I wrote a script
that could turn on and off the power to

136
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:30,019
that could turn on and off the power to
 

137
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,390
that could turn on and off the power to
the USB port why would I want to do that

138
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,400
the USB port why would I want to do that
 

139
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,460
the USB port why would I want to do that
well USB is how many volts 5 volts I

140
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,470
well USB is how many volts 5 volts I
 

141
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,770
well USB is how many volts 5 volts I
picked up a 5 volt relay and I set it up

142
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:44,780
picked up a 5 volt relay and I set it up
 

143
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,160
picked up a 5 volt relay and I set it up
so that a USB cable went into that relay

144
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,170
so that a USB cable went into that relay
 

145
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,789
so that a USB cable went into that relay
and I could in the software turn off and

146
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:51,799
and I could in the software turn off and
 

147
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,099
and I could in the software turn off and
on the power to that relay basically

148
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:54,109
on the power to that relay basically
 

149
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,309
on the power to that relay basically
tripping the circuit so that relay then

150
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:57,319
tripping the circuit so that relay then
 

151
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,309
tripping the circuit so that relay then
had the power cable which was 12 volts

152
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
had the power cable which was 12 volts
 

153
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,349
had the power cable which was 12 volts
going to my modem my router board was

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:05,359
going to my modem my router board was
 

155
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,780
going to my modem my router board was
then the software was checking every 5

the power on the USB port and what that
 

177
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,999
the power on the USB port and what that
then did is it cut the power on the

then did is it cut the power on the
 

179
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,619
then did is it cut the power on the

to turn off my modem and then it waited

182
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:43,580
to turn off my modem and then it waited
 

183
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,879
to turn off my modem and then it waited
five seconds I programmed that into this

184
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:45,889
five seconds I programmed that into this
 

185
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,360
five seconds I programmed that into this
and then fired it back up again the

186
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,370
and then fired it back up again the
 

187
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,559
and then fired it back up again the
relay trip back

the modem powered back on and

190
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
the modem powered back on and
 

191
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,850
the modem powered back on and
essentially what I had done is I've

00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:54,860
essentially what I had done is I've
 

193
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,219

with my particular modem I would have to

204
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:08,690
with my particular modem I would have to
 

205
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,230
with my particular modem I would have to
power cycle that modem basically like

206
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,240
power cycle that modem basically like
 

207
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,540

micro tech I was able to do that
 

211
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,409
micro tech I was able to do that
programmatically using the USB port so

212
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:17,419
programmatically using the USB port so
 

213
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,170
programmatically using the USB port so
all that to say it's completely open in

there's also a piece of software called

390
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:02,630
there's also a piece of software called
 

391
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,930
there's also a piece of software called
wind box which is available for Windows

392
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:04,940
wind box which is available for Windows
 

393
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,890
wind box which is available for Windows
or Mac however it runs flawlessly on

394
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:08,900
or Mac however it runs flawlessly on
 

395
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,670
or Mac however it runs flawlessly on
Linux in wine so it basically will run

396
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:12,680
Linux in wine so it basically will run
 

397
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,380
Linux in wine so it basically will run
on all platforms you're gonna use the

398

on all platforms you're gonna use the
 

399
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,420
on all platforms you're gonna use the
Windows version on Linux and it runs

perfectly well why would you want to use
 

403
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,320
perfectly well why would you want to use
software when it has a web interface the

404
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,330
software when it has a web interface the
 

405
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,450
software when it has a web interface the
reason for that is because if you ever
