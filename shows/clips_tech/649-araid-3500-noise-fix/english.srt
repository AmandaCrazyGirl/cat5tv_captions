00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,640

I have set down a h4n this is a zoom h4n

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:09,650
I have set down a h4n this is a zoom h4n
 

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,680
I have set down a h4n this is a zoom h4n
which I've got on a tripod Stara mic

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:12,690
which I've got on a tripod Stara mic
 

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,430
which I've got on a tripod Stara mic
stand here this is recording with a mic

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
stand here this is recording with a mic
 

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,700
stand here this is recording with a mic
sensitivity of 40 so the the volume

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:19,710
sensitivity of 40 so the the volume
 

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,560
sensitivity of 40 so the the volume
level if you have an h4 n I've got this

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:21,570
level if you have an h4 n I've got this
 

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,040
level if you have an h4 n I've got this
set to 40 so it's picking up the ambient

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,050
set to 40 so it's picking up the ambient
 

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,410
set to 40 so it's picking up the ambient
noise right now it's not broadcasting to

14
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:27,420
noise right now it's not broadcasting to
 

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,640
noise right now it's not broadcasting to
you I'm going to switch to this

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:28,650
you I'm going to switch to this
 

17
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,669
you I'm going to switch to this
microphone in just a second but it's

18
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
microphone in just a second but it's
 

19
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,440
microphone in just a second but it's
picking up that ambient noise so that we

20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,450
picking up that ambient noise so that we
 

21
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,950
picking up that ambient noise so that we
can see those levels I've turned off the

22
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
can see those levels I've turned off the
 

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,910
can see those levels I've turned off the
auto mic levels on the h4 n so what

24
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
auto mic levels on the h4 n so what
 

25
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,590
auto mic levels on the h4 n so what
you're gonna get to hear and see

26
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:42,600
you're gonna get to hear and see
 

27
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,740
you're gonna get to hear and see
visually in goldwave are the wave tables

28
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:45,750
visually in goldwave are the wave tables
 

29
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,639
visually in goldwave are the wave tables
directly from this with no resampling

30
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:49,649
directly from this with no resampling
 

31
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,279
directly from this with no resampling
and no changes to the levels so that's

32
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:52,289
and no changes to the levels so that's
 

33
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,240
and no changes to the levels so that's
exactly the same from point A to point B

34
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,250
exactly the same from point A to point B
 

35
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,920
exactly the same from point A to point B
I mean there it's not going to change

36
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:57,930
I mean there it's not going to change
 

37
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,779
I mean there it's not going to change
the levels of the microphone that's

38
00:00:59,779 --> 00:00:59,789
the levels of the microphone that's
 

39
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,279
the levels of the microphone that's
gonna help us to be able to see tonight

40
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:01,289
gonna help us to be able to see tonight
 

41
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,439
gonna help us to be able to see tonight
what kind of a difference we can make by

42
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:03,449
what kind of a difference we can make by
 

43
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,700
what kind of a difference we can make by
changing a simple fan can attend all or

44
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:07,710
changing a simple fan can attend all or
 

45
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,020
changing a simple fan can attend all or
part reduce the noise in such a way that

46
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,030
part reduce the noise in such a way that
 

47
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,450
part reduce the noise in such a way that
it's actually worth our while

48
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:13,460
it's actually worth our while
 

49
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,670
it's actually worth our while
so this is our backup Drive it's an a

50
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
so this is our backup Drive it's an a
 

51
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,960
so this is our backup Drive it's an a
raid 3500

52
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:17,970
raid 3500

00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:20,369
- GP these things are fantastic it's a
 

55
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,550

mirroring unit so we've got a master

56
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
mirroring unit so we've got a master
 

57
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,499
mirroring unit so we've got a master
Drive and a secondary Drive and I can

58
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:24,509
Drive and a secondary Drive and I can
 

59
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,380
Drive and a secondary Drive and I can
pull this secondary Drive it's a 10

60
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:27,390
pull this secondary Drive it's a 10
 

61
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,920
pull this secondary Drive it's a 10
terabyte hard drive I pull that out pop

62
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:30,930
terabyte hard drive I pull that out pop
 

63
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,690
terabyte hard drive I pull that out pop
in a different one and a tree images and

64
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:32,700
in a different one and a tree images and
 

65
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,929
in a different one and a tree images and
I have an exact mirror at all times of

66
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:35,939
I have an exact mirror at all times of
 

67
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,359
I have an exact mirror at all times of
my backup then the server is down here

68
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:38,369
my backup then the server is down here
 

69
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,920
my backup then the server is down here
and this is actually the storage and the

70
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:39,930
and this is actually the storage and the
 

71
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,230
and this is actually the storage and the
Samba shares and everything else and

72
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
Samba shares and everything else and
 

73
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,270
Samba shares and everything else and
that's generating a lot of noise - so

74
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,280
that's generating a lot of noise - so
 

75
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,050
that's generating a lot of noise - so
right now let's just check out the

76
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,060
right now let's just check out the
 

77
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,270
right now let's just check out the
levels of everything running the way it

78
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,280
levels of everything running the way it
 

79
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,560
levels of everything running the way it
normally would I'm going to shut up for

80
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:51,570
normally would I'm going to shut up for
 

81
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,630
normally would I'm going to shut up for
a second and let you hear that and see

82
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
a second and let you hear that and see
 

83
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:06,899
a second and let you hear that and see
that visually

84
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:06,909

 

85
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,779

okay so that's the ambient noise just

86
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:09,789
okay so that's the ambient noise just
 

87
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,580
okay so that's the ambient noise just
coming off of everything the server the

88
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:11,590
coming off of everything the server the
 

89
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,290
coming off of everything the server the
backup everything running I'm gonna halt

90
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,300
backup everything running I'm gonna halt
 

91
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,500
backup everything running I'm gonna halt
the server which I've just done let's

92
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:16,510
the server which I've just done let's
 

93
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,729
the server which I've just done let's
listen

94
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:22,739

 

95
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,430

waiting for it to shut down

96
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440

 

97
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440

and it's still powered on so I'm going

98
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,450
and it's still powered on so I'm going
 

99
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:45,240
and it's still powered on so I'm going
to now power that off here we go

100
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,250

 

101
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,850

okay so with the server off there is a

102
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:48,860
okay so with the server off there is a
 

103
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,000
okay so with the server off there is a
notable difference but there's still a

104
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,010
notable difference but there's still a
 

105
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,190
notable difference but there's still a
lot of noise coming off just the backup

106
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,200
lot of noise coming off just the backup
 

107
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:03,900
lot of noise coming off just the backup
unit

108
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:03,910

 

109
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,580

all right so I'm gonna power that off

110
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,590
all right so I'm gonna power that off
 

111
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:18,360
all right so I'm gonna power that off
and we'll see how the room sounds what a

112
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,370
and we'll see how the room sounds what a
 

113
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,170
and we'll see how the room sounds what a
difference eh

114
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,180
difference eh
 

115
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,540
difference eh
okay so let's get this out of the way

116
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,550
okay so let's get this out of the way
 

117
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,790
okay so let's get this out of the way
and I'm gonna actually remove this

118
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:23,800
and I'm gonna actually remove this
 

119
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,220
and I'm gonna actually remove this
backup drive and so what I'm gonna do is

120
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,230
backup drive and so what I'm gonna do is
 

121
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,350
backup drive and so what I'm gonna do is
we're gonna throw a little nine dollar

122
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,360
we're gonna throw a little nine dollar
 

123
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,010
we're gonna throw a little nine dollar
fan in here to replace the stock fan and

124
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,020
fan in here to replace the stock fan and
 

125
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,370
fan in here to replace the stock fan and
the intention today it's not a

126
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:35,380
the intention today it's not a
 

127
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,650
the intention today it's not a
sophisticated tutorial or anything like

128
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:37,660
sophisticated tutorial or anything like
 

129
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,120
sophisticated tutorial or anything like
that it's not overly geeky however

130
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,130
that it's not overly geeky however
 

131
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,500
that it's not overly geeky however
something that we don't often think

132
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,510
something that we don't often think
 

133
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,140
something that we don't often think
about is that there are very simple and

134
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,150
about is that there are very simple and
 

135
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,110
about is that there are very simple and
very affordable solutions that we can

136
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
very affordable solutions that we can
 

137
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,050
very affordable solutions that we can
put into place that can help with this

138
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,060
put into place that can help with this
 

139
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,600
put into place that can help with this
ambient noise it doesn't just apply for

140
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:54,610
ambient noise it doesn't just apply for
 

141
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,940
ambient noise it doesn't just apply for
me here at the studio it applies for you

142
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:56,950
me here at the studio it applies for you
 

143
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,310
me here at the studio it applies for you
at home if you've got computers that

144
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,320
at home if you've got computers that
 

145
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
at home if you've got computers that
maybe you're generating a lot more noise

146
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,330
maybe you're generating a lot more noise
 

147
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,860
maybe you're generating a lot more noise
then they need to be maybe a solution is

148
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:04,870
then they need to be maybe a solution is
 

149
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,710
then they need to be maybe a solution is
to look at those fans and see if you can

150
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:07,720
to look at those fans and see if you can
 

151
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,360
to look at those fans and see if you can
cut that down look at the hard drives

152
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,370
cut that down look at the hard drives
 

153
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,640
cut that down look at the hard drives
and say hey I've got a lot of spinning

154
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,650
and say hey I've got a lot of spinning
 

155
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,770
and say hey I've got a lot of spinning
hard drives in there right now let's

156
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:13,780
hard drives in there right now let's
 

157
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,050
hard drives in there right now let's
instead replace those with some Kingston

158
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,060
instead replace those with some Kingston
 

159
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,630
instead replace those with some Kingston
SSDs which are they have no moving parts

160
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:18,640
SSDs which are they have no moving parts
 

161
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,740
SSDs which are they have no moving parts
and they make absolutely no noise they

162
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:22,750
and they make absolutely no noise they
 

163
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,150
and they make absolutely no noise they
also incidentally generate less heat

164
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
also incidentally generate less heat
 

165
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,100
also incidentally generate less heat
which is a nice bonus as well so this

166
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,110
which is a nice bonus as well so this
 

167
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,450
which is a nice bonus as well so this
backup unit is generating in my opinion

168
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,460
backup unit is generating in my opinion
 

169
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,990
backup unit is generating in my opinion
way more noise than I should be having

170
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
way more noise than I should be having
 

171
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,300
way more noise than I should be having
from a backup unit I mean it's it's my

172
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,310
from a backup unit I mean it's it's my
 

173
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,240
from a backup unit I mean it's it's my
backup it's incredibly important however

174
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,250
backup it's incredibly important however
 

175
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,900
backup it's incredibly important however
it is just my backup it's just two hard

176
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:45,910
it is just my backup it's just two hard
 

177
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,520
it is just my backup it's just two hard
drives spinning away generating that

178
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,530
drives spinning away generating that
 

179
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,800
drives spinning away generating that
much heat that it has to be running a

180
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:52,810
much heat that it has to be running a
 

181
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,940
much heat that it has to be running a
fan at full capacity eat all the time

182
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:56,950
fan at full capacity eat all the time
 

183
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,220
fan at full capacity eat all the time
so the fan that I got is a pretty

184
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,230
so the fan that I got is a pretty
 

185
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,270
so the fan that I got is a pretty
popular one it's an Arctic f8 silent so

186
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
popular one it's an Arctic f8 silent so
 

187
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,670
popular one it's an Arctic f8 silent so
do keep in mind it is the silent model

188
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
do keep in mind it is the silent model
 

189
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,180
do keep in mind it is the silent model
and it says on the box extra quiet fan

190
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,190
and it says on the box extra quiet fan
 

191
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,780
and it says on the box extra quiet fan
and you can see on the back of this unit

192
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:11,790
and you can see on the back of this unit
 

193
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,610
and you can see on the back of this unit
it does have a fan to keep it everything

194
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:14,620
it does have a fan to keep it everything
 

195
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,960
it does have a fan to keep it everything
cool so that's what we're gonna be

196
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:15,970
cool so that's what we're gonna be
 

197
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,150
cool so that's what we're gonna be
replacing

198
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,160
replacing
 

199
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,880
replacing
I feel like maybe the stock fan is

200
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:19,890
I feel like maybe the stock fan is
 

201
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,330
I feel like maybe the stock fan is
louder than it has to be you guys could

202
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340
louder than it has to be you guys could
 

203
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,360
louder than it has to be you guys could
hear that you could see that visually

204
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,370
hear that you could see that visually
 

205
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,800
hear that you could see that visually
how much ambient noise this thing was

206
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:27,810
how much ambient noise this thing was
 

207
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:36,050
how much ambient noise this thing was
generating it's really really easy to do

208
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,060
generating it's really really easy to do
 

209
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,810
generating it's really really easy to do
this kind of it's not even a repair it

210
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:38,820
this kind of it's not even a repair it
 

211
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,880
this kind of it's not even a repair it
would be a repair if the original fan

212
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:40,890
would be a repair if the original fan
 

213
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,730
would be a repair if the original fan
wasn't wasn't working in this case I'm

214
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:43,740
wasn't wasn't working in this case I'm
 

215
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,660
wasn't wasn't working in this case I'm
replacing a working fan but it's just a

216
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:47,670
replacing a working fan but it's just a
 

217
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,810
replacing a working fan but it's just a
noisy fan all right so what do we have

218
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:50,820
noisy fan all right so what do we have
 

219
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,680
noisy fan all right so what do we have
here we've got some we've got a tie wrap

220
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:54,690
here we've got some we've got a tie wrap
 

221
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,970
here we've got some we've got a tie wrap
here that I'm gonna have to cut I don't

222
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:58,980
here that I'm gonna have to cut I don't
 

223

even have the correct tools yet like
 

225
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,390

worry don't do this don't ever do this I

234
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:21,830
worry don't do this don't ever do this I
 

235
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,810
worry don't do this don't ever do this I
just I'm gonna get in so much trouble

236
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:23,820
just I'm gonna get in so much trouble
 

237
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,040
just I'm gonna get in so much trouble
for doing that I know give me a hard

238
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,050
for doing that I know give me a hard
 

239
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,050
for doing that I know give me a hard
time YouTube all right so there is the

240
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,060
time YouTube all right so there is the
 

241
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,260
time YouTube all right so there is the
fan and this is the molex connector for

242
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,270
fan and this is the molex connector for
 

243
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,500
fan and this is the molex connector for
that fan ideally if I could take this

244
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:39,510
that fan ideally if I could take this
 

245
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,940
that fan ideally if I could take this
outside and blow it out with with a

246
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:42,950
outside and blow it out with with a
 

247
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,380
outside and blow it out with with a
camless air something like that that

248
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,390
camless air something like that that
 

249
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,880
camless air something like that that
would be ideal because there's a lot of

250
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:46,890
would be ideal because there's a lot of
 

251
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,520
would be ideal because there's a lot of
dust in there too

252
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:48,530
dust in there too
 

253
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:54,970
dust in there too
Wow all right so let's get into here so

254
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:54,980
Wow all right so let's get into here so
 

255
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,450
Wow all right so let's get into here so
simple folks

256
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,460
simple folks
 

257
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,420
simple folks
but the ultimate test is going to be I

258
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,430
but the ultimate test is going to be I
 

259
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,570
but the ultimate test is going to be I
want to know when we've got that

260
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:02,580
want to know when we've got that
 

261
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,130
want to know when we've got that
recorder recording so that we can

262
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,140
recorder recording so that we can
 

263
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,680
recorder recording so that we can
compare the actual ambient noise this is

264
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:06,690
compare the actual ambient noise this is
 

265
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,030
compare the actual ambient noise this is
generating when you get a fan you can

266
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,040
generating when you get a fan you can
 

267
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,760
generating when you get a fan you can
look at the fan and it will show you

268
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:13,770
look at the fan and it will show you
 

269
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,680
look at the fan and it will show you
because you wonder which which way is

270
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:15,690
because you wonder which which way is
 

271
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,600
because you wonder which which way is
the fan going to be blowing and I would

272
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:17,610
the fan going to be blowing and I would
 

273
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,860
the fan going to be blowing and I would
have thought the fan was blowing out

274
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:18,870
have thought the fan was blowing out
 

275
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,380
have thought the fan was blowing out
this way but if you look really really

276
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,390
this way but if you look really really
 

277
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,760
this way but if you look really really
closely see if you can get a fix on that

278
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:24,770
closely see if you can get a fix on that
 

279
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,260
closely see if you can get a fix on that
you guys see that there's actually an

280
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,270
you guys see that there's actually an
 

281
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,870
you guys see that there's actually an
arrow which points the way that the fan

282
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:29,880
arrow which points the way that the fan
 

283
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,000
arrow which points the way that the fan
is going to be blowing

284
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,010
is going to be blowing
 

285
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,360
is going to be blowing
so that's important to note it's exactly

286
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,370
so that's important to note it's exactly
 

287
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,500
so that's important to note it's exactly
the opposite of what I would have

288
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:35,510
the opposite of what I would have
 

289
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:43,000
the opposite of what I would have
thought so easy install and what I did

290
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,010
thought so easy install and what I did
 

291
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,670
thought so easy install and what I did
is I just I measured first and this is

292
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
is I just I measured first and this is
 

293
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,040
is I just I measured first and this is
an 80 millimeter so it was easy enough

294
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,050
an 80 millimeter so it was easy enough
 

295
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,100
an 80 millimeter so it was easy enough
to find online and as I say it was nine

296
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,110
to find online and as I say it was nine
 

297
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,170
to find online and as I say it was nine
bucks to get a hold of this fan so let's

298
00:07:59,170 --> 00:07:59,180
bucks to get a hold of this fan so let's
 

299
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,730
bucks to get a hold of this fan so let's
get that in there just gonna use the

300
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:00,740
get that in there just gonna use the
 

301
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,880
get that in there just gonna use the
same screws it came with screws too but

302
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:03,890
same screws it came with screws too but
 

303
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:13,090
same screws it came with screws too but
doesn't matter they're the same so I'm

304
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,100
doesn't matter they're the same so I'm
 

305
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,820
doesn't matter they're the same so I'm
hoping this is gonna make enough of a

306
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:15,830
hoping this is gonna make enough of a
 

307
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,730
hoping this is gonna make enough of a
difference here in this room that my

308
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:21,740
difference here in this room that my
 

309
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:29,650
difference here in this room that my
nine dollars is well-spent the a raid

310
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:29,660
nine dollars is well-spent the a raid
 

311
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,350
nine dollars is well-spent the a raid

would you like that backup Drive and so
 

325
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,790
would you like that backup Drive and so
they gifted it to us and I've used it

326
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:57,800
they gifted it to us and I've used it
 

327
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,880
they gifted it to us and I've used it
ever since and it's wonderful these are

ever since and it's wonderful these are
great devices okay so you notice I had a

330
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,220
great devices okay so you notice I had a
 

331
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,060
great devices okay so you notice I had a
molex on the old fan but I've got a

332
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,070
molex on the old fan but I've got a
 

333
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,130
molex on the old fan but I've got a
three pin on this fan so I've also

334
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,140
three pin on this fan so I've also
 

335
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,710
three pin on this fan so I've also
grabbed myself a molex to three pin

336
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:11,720
grabbed myself a molex to three pin
 

337
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,370
grabbed myself a molex to three pin
adapter so just pop your fan in there

338
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:15,380
adapter so just pop your fan in there
 

339
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,740
adapter so just pop your fan in there
and that's just for the a raid because I

340
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,750
and that's just for the a raid because I
 

341
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,890
and that's just for the a raid because I
knew that the a raid was using molex and

342
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:22,900
knew that the a raid was using molex and
 

343
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,650
knew that the a raid was using molex and
here we go

344
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:28,660

 

345
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,420

come on these adapters can be a beast

346
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:31,430
come on these adapters can be a beast
 

347
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,040
come on these adapters can be a beast
they're not really just gonna line them

348
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,050
they're not really just gonna line them
 

349
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,850
they're not really just gonna line them
up right okay so let's put this on I'm

350
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:39,860
up right okay so let's put this on I'm
 

351
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,650
up right okay so let's put this on I'm
not gonna screw it all together just now

352
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:41,660
not gonna screw it all together just now
 

353
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,340
not gonna screw it all together just now
just for the sake of good TV because

354
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,350
just for the sake of good TV because
 

355
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,790
just for the sake of good TV because
that's not really all that exciting but

356
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:47,800
that's not really all that exciting but
 

357
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,710
that's not really all that exciting but
even without the screws we're gonna have

358
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
even without the screws we're gonna have
 

359
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,889
even without the screws we're gonna have
exactly the same ambient noise as with

360
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:53,899
exactly the same ambient noise as with
 

361
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,030
exactly the same ambient noise as with
the screws I don't think that's gonna

362
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
the screws I don't think that's gonna
 

363
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,910
the screws I don't think that's gonna
affect the accuracy whatsoever of our

364
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
affect the accuracy whatsoever of our
 

365
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,949
affect the accuracy whatsoever of our
test so I'm going to just put this back

366
00:09:59,949 --> 00:09:59,959
test so I'm going to just put this back
 

367
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,009
test so I'm going to just put this back
on my server rack plug in the SATA cable

368
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:05,019
on my server rack plug in the SATA cable
 

369
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:09,990
on my server rack plug in the SATA cable
eSATA which just goes in the back here

370
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
eSATA which just goes in the back here
 

371
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,480
eSATA which just goes in the back here
if I can find it I wasn't even in the

372
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,490
if I can find it I wasn't even in the
 

373
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,720
if I can find it I wasn't even in the
right place there we are and it's a

374
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:22,730
right place there we are and it's a
 

375
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,300
right place there we are and it's a
full-size power cable just like a

376
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,310
full-size power cable just like a
 

377
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,150
full-size power cable just like a
computer cable and if we're ready now

378
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,160
computer cable and if we're ready now
 

379
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,250
computer cable and if we're ready now
this is still recording and place it

380
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,260
this is still recording and place it
 

381
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:51,210
this is still recording and place it
right at the exact same spot and fire up

382
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,220

 

383
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,600

what a difference oh my goodness I have

384
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:54,610
what a difference oh my goodness I have
 

385
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,710
what a difference oh my goodness I have
to actually make sure that this is

386
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:55,720
to actually make sure that this is
 

387
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,640
to actually make sure that this is
working and it is sure enough she's

388
00:10:59,640 --> 00:10:59,650
working and it is sure enough she's
 

389
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:13,650
working and it is sure enough she's
blowing air

390
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:13,660

 

391
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,810

beautiful all right I am gonna fire back

392
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:16,820
beautiful all right I am gonna fire back
 

393
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,040
beautiful all right I am gonna fire back
up the server because the server

394
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,050
up the server because the server
 

395
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,010
up the server because the server
generated a lot of noise too and there's

396
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,020
generated a lot of noise too and there's
 

397
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,389
generated a lot of noise too and there's
not a lot I can do about that it's an

398
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
not a lot I can do about that it's an
 

399
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,610
not a lot I can do about that it's an
hour 5:10 they're pretty noisy servers

400
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:24,620
hour 5:10 they're pretty noisy servers
 

401
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,200
hour 5:10 they're pretty noisy servers
but let's fire it up just so that I can

402
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,210
but let's fire it up just so that I can
 

403
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,110
but let's fire it up just so that I can
compare the ambient noise difference you

404
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
compare the ambient noise difference you
 

405
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,470
compare the ambient noise difference you
can hear that the backup Drive alone

406
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:31,480
can hear that the backup Drive alone
 

407
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,769
can hear that the backup Drive alone
huge difference now let's fire back up

408
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:35,779
huge difference now let's fire back up
 

409
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,060
huge difference now let's fire back up
the server this can get loud for a

410
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,070
the server this can get loud for a
 

411
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:46,040
the server this can get loud for a
second because they fire up loud

412
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,050

 

413
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:52,450

415
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,269

still notably quieter but let's wait for

416
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
still notably quieter but let's wait for
 

417
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,880
still notably quieter but let's wait for
it because these servers will those fans

418
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:57,890
it because these servers will those fans
 

419
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,920
it because these servers will those fans
are gonna calm down in a moment they

420
00:11:59,920 --> 00:11:59,930
are gonna calm down in a moment they
 

421
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,980
are gonna calm down in a moment they
blow out the dust and everything before

422
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:01,990
blow out the dust and everything before
 

423
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,880
blow out the dust and everything before
as they're just first booting up once

424
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:06,890
as they're just first booting up once
 

425
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,560
as they're just first booting up once
the drives start flashing that means

426
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,570
the drives start flashing that means
 

427
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:16,230
the drives start flashing that means
it's booting

428
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240

 

429
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,060

it's still pretty loud but it's nowhere

430
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,070
it's still pretty loud but it's nowhere
 

431
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,880
it's still pretty loud but it's nowhere
near and here you can hear wine in them

432
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,890
near and here you can hear wine in them
 

433
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:41,480
near and here you can hear wine in them
I can't at least

434
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:41,490

 

435
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,689

and there she goes starting the boot up

436
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:44,699
and there she goes starting the boot up
 

437
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,250
and there she goes starting the boot up
process

438
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,260

 

439
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,200

so once it's finished booting we'll have

440
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,210
so once it's finished booting we'll have
 

441
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,570
so once it's finished booting we'll have
a pretty good impression as to the

442
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:53,580
a pretty good impression as to the
 

443
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,600
a pretty good impression as to the
difference that this is made for nine

444
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:56,610
difference that this is made for nine
 

445
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,990
difference that this is made for nine
bucks I can also be doing the same thing

446
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
bucks I can also be doing the same thing
 

447
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,170
bucks I can also be doing the same thing
you remember that my laptop computer had

448
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,180
you remember that my laptop computer had
 

449
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,240
you remember that my laptop computer had
a really noisy fan my ThinkPad and so

450
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,250
a really noisy fan my ThinkPad and so
 

451
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,090
a really noisy fan my ThinkPad and so
I've also ordered a replacement fan for

452
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,100
I've also ordered a replacement fan for
 

453
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,520
I've also ordered a replacement fan for
that which has arrived I haven't gotten

454
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:13,530
that which has arrived I haven't gotten
 

455
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,810
that which has arrived I haven't gotten
into that but while we're waiting for

456
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:14,820
into that but while we're waiting for
 

457
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,240
into that but while we're waiting for
that to boot so like this is a really

458
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,250
that to boot so like this is a really
 

459
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,130
that to boot so like this is a really
simple fix that you can just do for a

460
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,140
simple fix that you can just do for a
 

461
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,990
simple fix that you can just do for a
lot of your devices I mean who would

462
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,000
lot of your devices I mean who would
 

463
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
lot of your devices I mean who would
have thought your backup drive even

464
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,610
have thought your backup drive even
 

465
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,490
have thought your backup drive even
let's get into this box though let's see

466
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:25,500
let's get into this box though let's see
 

467
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:36,880
let's get into this box though let's see
what they've sent me yeah there we are

469
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,980

there it is so that's the cooling system

470
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:39,990
there it is so that's the cooling system
 

471
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,850
there it is so that's the cooling system
for my laptop and that's going to make

472
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:43,860
for my laptop and that's going to make
 

473
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,610
for my laptop and that's going to make
that same amount of difference for for

474
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:46,620
that same amount of difference for for
 

475
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,860
that same amount of difference for for
my laptop computer so you can get these

476
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:48,870
my laptop computer so you can get these
 

477
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,960
my laptop computer so you can get these
kind of replacement parts and you don't

478
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:50,970
kind of replacement parts and you don't
 

479
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,880
kind of replacement parts and you don't
have to replace a whole laptop or a

480
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:52,890
have to replace a whole laptop or a
 

481
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,640
have to replace a whole laptop or a
whole backup drive to reduce the ambient

482
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:55,650
whole backup drive to reduce the ambient
 

483
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,040
whole backup drive to reduce the ambient
noise so now I'm gonna switch back to

484
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,050
noise so now I'm gonna switch back to
 

485
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,810
noise so now I'm gonna switch back to
this microphone so that we can hear with

486
00:13:59,810 --> 00:13:59,820
this microphone so that we can hear with
 

487
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,240
this microphone so that we can hear with
the server running the backup drive

488
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,250
the server running the backup drive
 

489
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,660
the server running the backup drive
running how does this compare to when I

490
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:05,670
running how does this compare to when I
 

491
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,720
running how does this compare to when I
first started this segment as still

492
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:08,730
first started this segment as still
 

493
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,460
first started this segment as still
booting it's doing a lot of reading so

494
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,470
booting it's doing a lot of reading so
 

495
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,990
booting it's doing a lot of reading so
it might be a little bit inaccurate

496
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
it might be a little bit inaccurate
 

497
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,390
it might be a little bit inaccurate
let's there you can hear that it's

498
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,400
let's there you can hear that it's
 

499
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,990
let's there you can hear that it's
slowing down

500
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,000
slowing down
 

501
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,600
slowing down
let's give it just another split second

502
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,610
let's give it just another split second
 

503
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,180
let's give it just another split second
here you can see the drives are going

504
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,190
here you can see the drives are going
 

505
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,980
here you can see the drives are going
crazy so that means it's still in the

506
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:21,990
crazy so that means it's still in the
 

507
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,579
crazy so that means it's still in the
boot process

508
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:27,589

 

509
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,800

what a difference there I'm gonna in

510
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:30,810
what a difference there I'm gonna in
 

511
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,300
what a difference there I'm gonna in
post-production I'm gonna just go back

512
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,310
post-production I'm gonna just go back
 

513
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,110
post-production I'm gonna just go back
over so this is the array Drive by

514
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,120
over so this is the array Drive by
 

515
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,230
over so this is the array Drive by
itself just the backup servers off all

516
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,240
itself just the backup servers off all
 

517
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,880
itself just the backup servers off all
by itself before I replace the fan and

518
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:42,890
by itself before I replace the fan and
 

519
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,030
by itself before I replace the fan and
here it is after I replace the fan and

520
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
here it is after I replace the fan and
 

521
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,530
here it is after I replace the fan and
here they are side by side those wave

522
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:51,540
here they are side by side those wave
 

523
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,990
here they are side by side those wave
tables just so you can see the the

524
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
tables just so you can see the the
 

525
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,480
tables just so you can see the the
difference in the ambient noise alright

526
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,490
difference in the ambient noise alright
 

527
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,910
difference in the ambient noise alright
so that server is still booting still

528
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
so that server is still booting still
 

529
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,400
so that server is still booting still
going through its thing but let's let's

530
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,410
going through its thing but let's let's
 

531
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,710
going through its thing but let's let's
get a look at how the ambient noise

532
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
get a look at how the ambient noise
 

533
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,690
get a look at how the ambient noise
altogether now so the server and the

534
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:08,700
altogether now so the server and the
 

535
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,130
altogether now so the server and the
backup driver back up and running just

536
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,140
backup driver back up and running just
 

537
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,350
backup driver back up and running just
like they were before how is that

538
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,360
like they were before how is that
 

539
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:35,310
like they were before how is that
affected

540
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:35,320

 

541
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,720

so the verdict for 9 bucks for 9 bucks

542
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:39,730
so the verdict for 9 bucks for 9 bucks
 

543
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,480
so the verdict for 9 bucks for 9 bucks
we brought down the ambient noise quite

544
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:42,490
we brought down the ambient noise quite
 

545
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,449
we brought down the ambient noise quite
noticeably here in the production studio

546
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:45,459
noticeably here in the production studio
 

547
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:47,220
noticeably here in the production studio
it's something I mean we all have

548
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,230
it's something I mean we all have
 

549
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,990
it's something I mean we all have
computers sitting next to us and

550
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,000
computers sitting next to us and
 

551
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,790
computers sitting next to us and
sometimes they're louder than they need

552
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
sometimes they're louder than they need
 

553
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,870
sometimes they're louder than they need
to be and sometimes we don't even

554
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:51,880
to be and sometimes we don't even
 

555
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,550
to be and sometimes we don't even
realize it but listen to your computer

556
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:53,560
realize it but listen to your computer
 

557
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,790
realize it but listen to your computer
and just see hey could this be a little

558
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
and just see hey could this be a little
 

559
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,160
and just see hey could this be a little
bit quieter and maybe replacing the CPU

560
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,170
bit quieter and maybe replacing the CPU
 

561
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,259
bit quieter and maybe replacing the CPU
fan or as I say switching out from a

562
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:01,269
fan or as I say switching out from a
 

563
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,019
fan or as I say switching out from a
spinning hard drive to an SSD from

564
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:04,029
spinning hard drive to an SSD from
 

565
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,420
spinning hard drive to an SSD from
Kingston technology something like that

566
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,430
Kingston technology something like that
 

567
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,009
Kingston technology something like that
would make a huge difference to the

568
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:08,019
would make a huge difference to the
 

569
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:10,110
would make a huge difference to the
ambient noise in the room and it just

570
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,120
ambient noise in the room and it just
 

571
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,460
ambient noise in the room and it just
makes things so much better for

572
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,470
makes things so much better for
 

573
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,980
makes things so much better for
broadcast it's gonna be a lot better now

broadcast it's gonna be a lot better now
 

575
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,519
broadcast it's gonna be a lot better now
that's a noticeable difference it's not

576
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:17,529
that's a noticeable difference it's not
 

577
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:18,990
that's a noticeable difference it's not
