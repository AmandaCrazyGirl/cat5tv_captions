00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,080
six hundred dollar unit the software the
 

189
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,410
six hundred dollar unit the software the
firmware the capabilities of the

190
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:09,420
firmware the capabilities of the
 

191
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,550
firmware the capabilities of the
programming are completely the same so

192
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:13,560
programming are completely the same so
 

193
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,680
programming are completely the same so
the only limitation is based on hardware

194
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:15,690
the only limitation is based on hardware
 

195
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,750
the only limitation is based on hardware
so you can start off with something

196
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:17,760
so you can start off with something
 

197
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,060
so you can start off with something
really cheap and work your way up later

198
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,070
really cheap and work your way up later
 

199
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,409
really cheap and work your way up later
you can upgrade if you need something

200
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:21,419
you can upgrade if you need something
 

201
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,510
you can upgrade if you need something
better that's pretty cool

202
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
better that's pretty cool
 

203
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,350
better that's pretty cool
so again cat5 dot TV slash mikrotik the

204
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
so again cat5 dot TV slash mikrotik the
 

205
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,689
so again cat5 dot TV slash mikrotik the
now all that I've done is plugged in the

206
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:29,699
now all that I've done is plugged in the
 

207
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,790
now all that I've done is plugged in the
power so far but what we need to do

208
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:31,800
power so far but what we need to do
 

209
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,029
power so far but what we need to do
first and foremost is I need to bridge

210
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:35,039
first and foremost is I need to bridge
 

211
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,119
first and foremost is I need to bridge
my internet modem so my internet service

212
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:38,129
my internet modem so my internet service
 

213
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,270
my internet modem so my internet service
provider has provided an internet modem

214
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
provider has provided an internet modem
 

215
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,159
provider has provided an internet modem
that allows me connectivity but that

216
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:43,169
that allows me connectivity but that
 

217
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,379
that allows me connectivity but that
modem has a DHCP server it has a

218
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:45,389
modem has a DHCP server it has a
 

219
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,619
modem has a DHCP server it has a
firewall and it's basically allowing my

220
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:48,629
firewall and it's basically allowing my
 

221
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,170
firewall and it's basically allowing my
computers to communicate to the Internet

222
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,180
computers to communicate to the Internet
 

223
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,600
computers to communicate to the Internet
well I'm gonna replace that built-in

224
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:53,610
well I'm gonna replace that built-in
 

225
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,730
well I'm gonna replace that built-in
firewall in that built-in router with

226
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:55,740
firewall in that built-in router with
 

227
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,850
firewall in that built-in router with
and the DHCP server with my mikrotik so

228
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:58,860
and the DHCP server with my mikrotik so
 

229
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,270
and the DHCP server with my mikrotik so
I need to do what's called a bridge so

230
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
I need to do what's called a bridge so
 

231
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,469
I need to do what's called a bridge so
the modem that my ISP provides mine is a

232
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
the modem that my ISP provides mine is a
 

233
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,399
the modem that my ISP provides mine is a
hITRON modem I need to set it so that it

234
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:10,409
hITRON modem I need to set it so that it
 

235
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:13,430
hITRON modem I need to set it so that it
is nothing but a modem and then we're

236
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
is nothing but a modem and then we're
 

237
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,200
is nothing but a modem and then we're
going to use this device to control it

238
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,210
going to use this device to control it
 

239
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,629
going to use this device to control it
so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm

240
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm
 

241
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,459
so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm
gonna log into the interface and the

242
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:22,469
gonna log into the interface and the
 

243
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:25,339
gonna log into the interface and the
hITRON modems rcus admin is the login

244
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:25,349
hITRON modems rcus admin is the login
 

245
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,309
hITRON modems rcus admin is the login
your modem is going to be different so

246
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:28,319
your modem is going to be different so
 

247
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,700
your modem is going to be different so
do keep that in mind it's gonna be the

248
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:31,710
do keep that in mind it's gonna be the
 

249
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,550
do keep that in mind it's gonna be the
IP address of your gateway you can find

250
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
IP address of your gateway you can find
 

251
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,760
IP address of your gateway you can find
out more by contacting your ISP if

252
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:37,770
out more by contacting your ISP if
 

253
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,040
out more by contacting your ISP if
you're not sure how to do that but just

254
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,050
you're not sure how to do that but just
 

255
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,249
you're not sure how to do that but just
ask them hey how do i bridge my modem

256
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:43,259
ask them hey how do i bridge my modem
 

257
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,709
ask them hey how do i bridge my modem
that's the important thing so it is just

258
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:45,719
that's the important thing so it is just
 

259
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,659
that's the important thing so it is just
gonna be a dumb modem that gives my

260
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:47,669
gonna be a dumb modem that gives my
 

261
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,719
gonna be a dumb modem that gives my
mikrotik access to the Internet so on

262
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:50,729
mikrotik access to the Internet so on
 

263
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,640
mikrotik access to the Internet so on
the hITRON I'm gonna go into basic and

264
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:52,650
the hITRON I'm gonna go into basic and
 

265
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,640
the hITRON I'm gonna go into basic and
then gateway function and residential

266
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,650
then gateway function and residential
 

267
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,610
then gateway function and residential
gateway function is enabled by default

268
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:58,620
gateway function is enabled by default
 

269
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,249
gateway function is enabled by default
I want to simply disable that now keep

270
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:01,259
I want to simply disable that now keep
 

271
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,930
I want to simply disable that now keep
in mind as soon as I say okay

272
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:02,940
in mind as soon as I say okay
 

273
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,420
in mind as soon as I say okay
I'm gonna lose access to the Internet

274
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,430
I'm gonna lose access to the Internet
 

275
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,869
I'm gonna lose access to the Internet
once I hit Save Changes so let's do it

276
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:07,879
once I hit Save Changes so let's do it
 

277
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,240
once I hit Save Changes so let's do it
because now I have turned that into a

278
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,250
because now I have turned that into a
 

279
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,709
because now I have turned that into a
dumb modem so let's grab an Ethernet

280
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:15,719
dumb modem so let's grab an Ethernet
 

281
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:19,129
dumb modem so let's grab an Ethernet
cable and let's let's uplink our router

282
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,139
cable and let's let's uplink our router
 

283
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,709
cable and let's let's uplink our router
board so the router board port number

284
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:21,719
board so the router board port number
 

285
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:26,480
board so the router board port number
one I'm going to set as my LAN port so

286
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,490
one I'm going to set as my LAN port so
 

287
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,659
one I'm going to set as my LAN port so
I'm gonna connect that into my network

288
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:28,669
I'm gonna connect that into my network
 

289
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,399
I'm gonna connect that into my network
just get this out of the way this is a

290
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:31,409
just get this out of the way this is a
 

291
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,709
just get this out of the way this is a
little bit rickety because I'm doing

292
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:33,719
little bit rickety because I'm doing
 

293
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,630
little bit rickety because I'm doing
this you know

294
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:36,640

 

295
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,400

pretty makeshift but you're gonna get

296
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,410
pretty makeshift but you're gonna get
 

297
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,010
pretty makeshift but you're gonna get
the idea basically port number one from

298
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,020
the idea basically port number one from
 

299
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,020
the idea basically port number one from
the router board is going to come out to

300
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,030
the router board is going to come out to
 

301
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,730
the router board is going to come out to
my my modem so I'm gonna plug that in to

302
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:50,740
my my modem so I'm gonna plug that in to
 

303
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,640
my my modem so I'm gonna plug that in to
my modem here there we go connected and

304
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:57,650
my modem here there we go connected and
 

305
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,790
my modem here there we go connected and
good let's see yeah doesn't seem to

306
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:03,800
good let's see yeah doesn't seem to
 

307
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,730
good let's see yeah doesn't seem to
matter which port I go in I'm gonna just

308
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:06,740
matter which port I go in I'm gonna just
 

309
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,970
matter which port I go in I'm gonna just
jam that in there there we go and now

310
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:09,980
jam that in there there we go and now
 

311
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,130
jam that in there there we go and now
I'm gonna take the cable that was up

312
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,140
I'm gonna take the cable that was up
 

313
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,230
I'm gonna take the cable that was up
linking me to the network and I'm gonna

314
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
linking me to the network and I'm gonna
 

315
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,170
linking me to the network and I'm gonna
plug this into port number two on my

316
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,180
plug this into port number two on my
 

317
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,490
plug this into port number two on my
router board and that's going to give me

318
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:18,500
router board and that's going to give me
 

319
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,460
router board and that's going to give me
access to the micro tech I say router

320
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,470
access to the micro tech I say router
 

321
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,590
access to the micro tech I say router
board mikrotik is the brand router board

322
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:23,600
board mikrotik is the brand router board
 

323
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,820
board mikrotik is the brand router board
is the product so my network which is my

324
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:27,830
is the product so my network which is my
 

325
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,090
is the product so my network which is my
switch is now connected to port number

326
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,100
switch is now connected to port number
 

327
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,370
switch is now connected to port number
two so my computer is basically seeing

328
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:33,380
two so my computer is basically seeing
 

329
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,080
two so my computer is basically seeing
port number two port number one on the

330
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,090
port number two port number one on the
 

331
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,980
port number two port number one on the
mikrotik is going into the back of the

332
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:38,990
mikrotik is going into the back of the
 

333
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,550
mikrotik is going into the back of the
actual ISP modem which is now set to

334
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
actual ISP modem which is now set to
 

335
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,909
actual ISP modem which is now set to
bridged mode so let's jump over to our

336
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
bridged mode so let's jump over to our
 

337
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,940
bridged mode so let's jump over to our
mikrotik first of all we need to see

338
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:48,950
mikrotik first of all we need to see
 

339
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,409
mikrotik first of all we need to see
what's now one thing you're gonna notice

340
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:50,419
what's now one thing you're gonna notice
 

341
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,570
what's now one thing you're gonna notice
is that I am at 10.00 dot

342
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:54,580
is that I am at 10.00 dot
 

343
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,640
is that I am at 10.00 dot
to find out what my new network is now

344
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:57,650
to find out what my new network is now
 

345
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,420
to find out what my new network is now
that I am on the micro tech ipconfig

346
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:00,430
that I am on the micro tech ipconfig
 

347
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,409
that I am on the micro tech ipconfig
/all so this is in Windows in Linux

348
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:05,419
/all so this is in Windows in Linux
 

349
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,020
/all so this is in Windows in Linux
you're gonna type IP space dash a and

350
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,030
you're gonna type IP space dash a and
 

351
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,480
you're gonna type IP space dash a and
let's find out what kind of networking

352
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,490
let's find out what kind of networking
 

353
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,270
let's find out what kind of networking
I've got here okay I'm still seeing a

354
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
I've got here okay I'm still seeing a
 

355
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,360
I've got here okay I'm still seeing a
default gateway of 10.0.0.0 it has not

356
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,370
default gateway of 10.0.0.0 it has not
 

357
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,370
default gateway of 10.0.0.0 it has not
refreshed yet so well let's check so I'm

358
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:24,380
refreshed yet so well let's check so I'm
 

359
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
refreshed yet so well let's check so I'm
on Windows 10 and even though a reboot

360
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,390
on Windows 10 and even though a reboot
 

361
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,250
on Windows 10 and even though a reboot
could trigger basically fixing your

362
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,260
could trigger basically fixing your
 

363
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,709
could trigger basically fixing your
network by trying to reconnect all I'm

364
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
network by trying to reconnect all I'm
 

365
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,820
network by trying to reconnect all I'm
gonna do is I'm going to right-click on

366
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:33,830
gonna do is I'm going to right-click on
 

367
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,480
gonna do is I'm going to right-click on
my a thern ed adapter and disconnect

368
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,490
my a thern ed adapter and disconnect
 

369
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,610
my a thern ed adapter and disconnect
disable the Ethernet adapter and

370
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:39,620
disable the Ethernet adapter and
 

371
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,089
disable the Ethernet adapter and
re-enable it and now once it reconnects

372
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:43,099
re-enable it and now once it reconnects
 

373
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,550
re-enable it and now once it reconnects
I should be able to do an IP config

374
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:45,560
I should be able to do an IP config
 

375
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,740
I should be able to do an IP config
slash all and should see yes

376
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:48,750
slash all and should see yes
 

377
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:55,160
slash all and should see yes
okay so we now are on 192.168.1 so let's

378
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,170
okay so we now are on 192.168.1 so let's
 

379
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,519
okay so we now are on 192.168.1 so let's
try that 192.168.1 and there we are with

380
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:01,529
try that 192.168.1 and there we are with
 

381
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:06,199
try that 192.168.1 and there we are with
router OS so in retro ass first thing we

382
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:06,209
router OS so in retro ass first thing we
 

383
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,910
router OS so in retro ass first thing we
with now this is the quick-set so this

384
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
with now this is the quick-set so this
 

385
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,369
with now this is the quick-set so this
is allowing us to quickly set up our

386
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:10,379
is allowing us to quickly set up our
 

387
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,249
is allowing us to quickly set up our
mikrotik router device so let's see

388
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:13,259
mikrotik router device so let's see
 

389
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,990
mikrotik router device so let's see
what's happening here so DHCP server

390
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
what's happening here so DHCP server
 

391
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,550
what's happening here so DHCP server
range I want to change that to 10.0.0.0

392
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560

 

393
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,199

to 10.0.0.0 for now you may not need to

394
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:27,209
to 10.0.0.0 for now you may not need to
 

395
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:30,160
to 10.0.0.0 for now you may not need to
do that because you may be using

396
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,170
do that because you may be using
 

397
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,119
do that because you may be using
192.168.1

398
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:32,129
192.168.1
 

399
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,150
192.168.1
- I here at the studio I use the

400
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,160
- I here at the studio I use the
 

401
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,650
- I here at the studio I use the
10.0.0.0 block so that is general

402
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:39,660
10.0.0.0 block so that is general
 

403
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,389
10.0.0.0 block so that is general
networking and not really what I'm

404
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:41,399
networking and not really what I'm
 

405
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,389
networking and not really what I'm
setting out to do here and and teach you

406
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
setting out to do here and and teach you
 

407
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,329
setting out to do here and and teach you
but essentially that's my IP block if

408
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:47,339
but essentially that's my IP block if
 

409
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,720
but essentially that's my IP block if
you're happy with 192.168.1 that's fine

410
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:50,730
you're happy with 192.168.1 that's fine
 

411
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:57,230
you're happy with 192.168.1 that's fine
I'm doing 10.0.0.0 my router and setting

412
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,240
I'm doing 10.0.0.0 my router and setting
 

413
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,079
I'm doing 10.0.0.0 my router and setting
the DHCP server range accordingly from

414
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:00,089
the DHCP server range accordingly from
 

415
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:01,730
the DHCP server range accordingly from
one hundred to two hundred and fifty

416
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:01,740
one hundred to two hundred and fifty
 

417
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,549
one hundred to two hundred and fifty
four all right so anything else that I

418
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:04,559
four all right so anything else that I
 

419
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,319
four all right so anything else that I
need to set here I can set up my

420
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:06,329
need to set here I can set up my
 

421
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:09,259
need to set here I can set up my
wireless and everything else I'm gonna

422
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:09,269
wireless and everything else I'm gonna
 

423
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,769
wireless and everything else I'm gonna
do that in a little bit so let's just

424
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:12,779
do that in a little bit so let's just
 

425
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,369
do that in a little bit so let's just
get our IP address working here so I'm

426
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:16,379
get our IP address working here so I'm
 

427
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,009
get our IP address working here so I'm
going to hit apply configuration notice

428
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:19,019
going to hit apply configuration notice
 

429
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,530
going to hit apply configuration notice
the address acquisition is grabbing from

430
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:21,540
the address acquisition is grabbing from
 

431
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,329
the address acquisition is grabbing from
Ethernet port number one that's why I

432
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:23,339
Ethernet port number one that's why I
 

433
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,429
Ethernet port number one that's why I
plugged my modem in there and I've set

434
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:25,439
plugged my modem in there and I've set
 

435
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:28,519
plugged my modem in there and I've set
it to automatically get the IP address

436
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:28,529
it to automatically get the IP address
 

437
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,299
it to automatically get the IP address
so let's see what happens here as as I

438
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:32,309
so let's see what happens here as as I
 

439
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,490
so let's see what happens here as as I
apply that configuration so we should

440
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:34,500
apply that configuration so we should
 

441
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,559
apply that configuration so we should
see that that router is going to restart

442
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:36,569
see that that router is going to restart
 

443
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,879
see that that router is going to restart
itself and when it does we're gonna be

444
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:40,889
itself and when it does we're gonna be
 

445
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:50,290
itself and when it does we're gonna be
on a 1000 that work

446
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:50,300

 

447
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:59,510

cheap and cheerful solution alright 10

448
00:10:59,510 --> 00:10:59,520
cheap and cheerful solution alright 10
 

449
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,990
cheap and cheerful solution alright 10

450
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,000

 

451
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,520

to to get everything set up okay so

452
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,530
to to get everything set up okay so
 

453
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,640
to to get everything set up okay so
let's let's renew our DHCP from this is

454
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:13,650
let's let's renew our DHCP from this is
 

455
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:19,790
let's let's renew our DHCP from this is
our internet connection let's see what

456
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:19,800
our internet connection let's see what
 

457
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,390
our internet connection let's see what
it's given us let's release and renew

458
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,400
it's given us let's release and renew
 

459
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,240
it's given us let's release and renew
make sure yes we are on Ethernet port

online let's do a quick speed test let's

476
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,280
online let's do a quick speed test let's
 

477
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,660
online let's do a quick speed test let's
see how she's doing

478
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:00,670

 

479
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:09,910

go-go-go so that was a pretty miserable

480
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
go-go-go so that was a pretty miserable
 

481
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,350
go-go-go so that was a pretty miserable
download speed upload speed not terrible

482
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:16,360
download speed upload speed not terrible
 

483
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:24,490
download speed upload speed not terrible
test again something's up there maybe

484
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:24,500
test again something's up there maybe
 

485
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,720
test again something's up there maybe
we're just in that you know that

486
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:27,730
we're just in that you know that
 

487
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,270
we're just in that you know that
pandemic internet speed everything is

488
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,280
pandemic internet speed everything is
 

489
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,090
pandemic internet speed everything is
pretty slow right now yeah getting

490
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,100
pretty slow right now yeah getting
 

491
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,750
pretty slow right now yeah getting
pretty low speeds so even still a 10

492
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
pretty low speeds so even still a 10
 

493
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,960
pretty low speeds so even still a 10
over 100 router would only give me up to

494
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:39,970
over 100 router would only give me up to
 

495
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,720
over 100 router would only give me up to
100 megabits and I'm pushing 156 right

496
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:43,730
100 megabits and I'm pushing 156 right
 

497
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,480
100 megabits and I'm pushing 156 right
now that's pretty bad considering I'm

498
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,490
now that's pretty bad considering I'm
 

499
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,850
now that's pretty bad considering I'm
supposed to have a gig but at least I

500
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:48,860
supposed to have a gig but at least I
 

501
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,220
supposed to have a gig but at least I
know that I'm getting better than 100

502
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,230
know that I'm getting better than 100
 

503
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,490
know that I'm getting better than 100
megabits a second so there we go

504
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:53,500
megabits a second so there we go
 

505
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,260
megabits a second so there we go
everything looks pretty well set let's

506
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,270
everything looks pretty well set let's
 

507
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,530
everything looks pretty well set let's
jump into web Figg now this is what

508
00:12:59,530 --> 00:12:59,540
jump into web Figg now this is what
 

509
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,580
jump into web Figg now this is what
makes the mikrotik so very powerful this

510
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:03,590
makes the mikrotik so very powerful this
 

511
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,310
makes the mikrotik so very powerful this
is the software which you will get lost

512
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
is the software which you will get lost
 

513
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,980
is the software which you will get lost
if you try to find your way through here

514
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,990
if you try to find your way through here
 

515
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,200
if you try to find your way through here
and note that that's as quick as it was

516
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,210
and note that that's as quick as it was
 

517
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,850
and note that that's as quick as it was
to get everything up and running but I

518
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:12,860
to get everything up and running but I
 

519
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,500
to get everything up and running but I
am going to need to set up things like

520
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,510
am going to need to set up things like
 

521
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:22,660
am going to need to set up things like
under IP I can set up DHCP reservations

522
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:22,670
under IP I can set up DHCP reservations
 

523
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,720
under IP I can set up DHCP reservations
so as my devices connect I can actually

524
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:25,730
so as my devices connect I can actually
 

525
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,590
so as my devices connect I can actually
set these up as static devices you'll

526
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
set these up as static devices you'll
 

527
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,060
set these up as static devices you'll
notice it's counting backwards so my

528
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,070
notice it's counting backwards so my
 

529
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,790
notice it's counting backwards so my
computer actually got to 54 so it's

530
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:33,800
computer actually got to 54 so it's
 

531
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
computer actually got to 54 so it's
actually starting at the high end of the

532
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,210
actually starting at the high end of the
 

533
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,180
actually starting at the high end of the
DHCP pool and working its way down

534
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,190
DHCP pool and working its way down
 

535
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,540
DHCP pool and working its way down
which is fine if I wanted to I could

536
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:40,550
which is fine if I wanted to I could
 

537
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,220
which is fine if I wanted to I could
make that static by simply clicking on

538
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,230
make that static by simply clicking on
 

539
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,860
make that static by simply clicking on
make static again I'm an IP dhcp server

540
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:44,870
make static again I'm an IP dhcp server

okay so network name on 2 gigahertz I

568
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:18,820
okay so network name on 2 gigahertz I
 

569
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,330
okay so network name on 2 gigahertz I
can leave it as is or I can say cat 5 TV

time and notice I'm starting to pick up
 

599
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,470
time and notice I'm starting to pick up
some Wi-Fi connectivity here

600

I don't have to reboot every time I
 

603
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,070
I don't have to reboot every time I
change the configuration and when I

604
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,080
change the configuration and when I
 

605
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,900
change the configuration and when I
create any kind of config it's

606

the router is that if I were to brick my
mikrotik and I don't want to lose the

616
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
mikrotik and I don't want to lose the
 

617
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,760
mikrotik and I don't want to lose the

settings that I've created how
 

619
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,350
settings that I've created how
presumably you've backed them up because

620
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
presumably you've backed them up because

you can within web fig that's part of
 

623
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,360
you can within web fig that's part of
the system so if I jump into that do you

best way to do that is use a tool like
 

691
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,380
best way to do that is use a tool like
like LastPass and generate a secure

like LastPass and generate a secure
 

693
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,110
like LastPass and generate a secure
password ok grab that make that your

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,120
password ok grab that make that your
 

695
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,230
password ok grab that make that your
password and and then use LastPass or

whatever password manager you're using
 

699
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,800
whatever password manager you're using
