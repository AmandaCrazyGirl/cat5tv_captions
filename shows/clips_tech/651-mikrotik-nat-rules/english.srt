1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:04,490

all right we've been looking at the

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:04,500
all right we've been looking at the
 

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,390
all right we've been looking at the
mikrotik routers advanced routing with

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
mikrotik routers advanced routing with
 

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,970
mikrotik routers advanced routing with
these devices I mean they fall into this

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:10,980
these devices I mean they fall into this
 

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,120
these devices I mean they fall into this
interesting category all of their own in

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,130
interesting category all of their own in
 

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,939
interesting category all of their own in
a way because they're priced like a

10
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:16,949
a way because they're priced like a
 

11
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,279
a way because they're priced like a
consumer router but they have the

12
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:19,289
consumer router but they have the
 

13
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,640
consumer router but they have the
feature set of an enterprise router so

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:22,650
feature set of an enterprise router so
 

15
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,740
feature set of an enterprise router so
suddenly you're able to do so much more

16
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:24,750
suddenly you're able to do so much more
 

17
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,009
suddenly you're able to do so much more
you're able to protect your network way

18
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:28,019
you're able to protect your network way
 

19
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,259
you're able to protect your network way
better than you could with a consumer

20
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:30,269
better than you could with a consumer
 

21
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,870
better than you could with a consumer
router and you're you're able to do that

22
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
router and you're you're able to do that
 

23
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,389
router and you're you're able to do that
for about the same price or maybe a

24
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399
for about the same price or maybe a
 

25
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,700
for about the same price or maybe a
little bit more but about the a tenth of

26
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:37,710
little bit more but about the a tenth of
 

27
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,250
little bit more but about the a tenth of
the price of an equivalent enterprise

28
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,260
the price of an equivalent enterprise
 

29
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,340
the price of an equivalent enterprise
level router so all that said they're

30
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,350
level router so all that said they're
 

31
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,290
level router so all that said they're
extremely cheap for what you get and

32
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,300
extremely cheap for what you get and
 

33
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,900
extremely cheap for what you get and
when you've used a mikrotik router for a

34
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:50,910
when you've used a mikrotik router for a
 

35
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,729
when you've used a mikrotik router for a
little while you start to realize wow

36
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:52,739
little while you start to realize wow
 

37
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,869
little while you start to realize wow
there's there's like no limits to this

38
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:55,879
there's there's like no limits to this
 

39
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,700
there's there's like no limits to this
it's like you can just you can code

40
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,710
it's like you can just you can code
 

41
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,279
it's like you can just you can code
stuff into it in their router OS

42
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:01,289
stuff into it in their router OS
 

43
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,579
stuff into it in their router OS
software and and you can manage all

44
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:04,589
software and and you can manage all
 

45
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,740
software and and you can manage all
kinds of stuff and all of a sudden you

46
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:06,750
kinds of stuff and all of a sudden you
 

47
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,240
kinds of stuff and all of a sudden you
start playing with caps man and your

48
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,250
start playing with caps man and your
 

49
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,270
start playing with caps man and your
mind is blown because you can do things

50
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
mind is blown because you can do things
 

51
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,109
mind is blown because you can do things
with a micro tech router for 30 40 50 a

00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
with a micro tech router for 30 40 50 a

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
with a micro tech router for 30 40 50 a
hundred and fifty dollars that you would

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:16,890
hundred and fifty dollars that you would
 

55
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,789
hundred and fifty dollars that you would
be doing with a router of equivalent

these consumer priced devices from micro

64
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
these consumer priced devices from micro
 

65
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,280
these consumer priced devices from micro
tech so the device that I'm looking at

66
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,290
tech so the device that I'm looking at
 

67
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,380
tech so the device that I'm looking at
here at the studio is the router board

68
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:36,390
here at the studio is the router board
 

69
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,240
here at the studio is the router board
RB 9 6 2 UI GS and that model is what

70
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,250
RB 9 6 2 UI GS and that model is what
 

71
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,399
RB 9 6 2 UI GS and that model is what
I've selected for us here at the studio

72
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:43,409
I've selected for us here at the studio
 

73
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,350
I've selected for us here at the studio
but it might not be exactly what you

74
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
but it might not be exactly what you
 

75
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,319
but it might not be exactly what you
want for your house or your home network

76
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:48,329
want for your house or your home network
 

77
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,590
want for your house or your home network
or your business network however that's

78
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
or your business network however that's
 

79
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,450
or your business network however that's
what's really cool about micro tech I

80
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,460
what's really cool about micro tech I
 

81
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,719
what's really cool about micro tech I
mean one of the things is that you just

82
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:56,729
mean one of the things is that you just
 

83
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,700
mean one of the things is that you just
pick the hardware that works for you and

84
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:58,710
pick the hardware that works for you and
 

85
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,340
pick the hardware that works for you and
the software is going to be the same

86
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,350
the software is going to be the same
 

87
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,010
the software is going to be the same
from device to device to device whether

88
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,020
from device to device to device whether
 

89
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,530
from device to device to device whether
you buy the 30 dollar unit or the 150

90
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:06,540
you buy the 30 dollar unit or the 150
 

91
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,690
you buy the 30 dollar unit or the 150
dollar unit or the 600 dollar unit it

92
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:08,700
dollar unit or the 600 dollar unit it
 

93
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,339
dollar unit or the 600 dollar unit it
doesn't matter as far as the software

94
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:10,349
doesn't matter as far as the software
 

95
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,070
doesn't matter as far as the software
goes your only limitation is in the hard

96
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,080
goes your only limitation is in the hard
 

97
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,550
goes your only limitation is in the hard
we're so where my device has both 2.4

98
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
we're so where my device has both 2.4
 

99
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,090
we're so where my device has both 2.4
and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi antennas and and

100
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,100
and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi antennas and and
 

101
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,970
and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi antennas and and
and transmitters you may buy a cheaper

102
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:22,980
and transmitters you may buy a cheaper
 

103
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,120
and transmitters you may buy a cheaper
device that only has 2.4 or only has 5

104
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,130
device that only has 2.4 or only has 5
 

105
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,540
device that only has 2.4 or only has 5
so those features will be limited only

106
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:29,550
so those features will be limited only
 

107
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,090
so those features will be limited only
by the hardware but the software itself

108
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,100
by the hardware but the software itself
 

109
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,430
by the hardware but the software itself
is the same so I I always start by

110
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
is the same so I I always start by
 

111
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,990
is the same so I I always start by
saying that because I want you to

112
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
saying that because I want you to
 

113
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,880
saying that because I want you to
understand you don't have to buy the

114
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:37,890
understand you don't have to buy the
 

115
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,820
understand you don't have to buy the
same one I bought you find the one that

116
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:40,830
same one I bought you find the one that
 

117
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,040
same one I bought you find the one that
works for you and then you can follow

118
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,050
works for you and then you can follow
 

119
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,790
works for you and then you can follow
along with this series and amazingly

120
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
along with this series and amazingly
 

121
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,190
along with this series and amazingly
even if you have a different model

122
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
even if you have a different model
 

123
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,050
even if you have a different model
altogether you're gonna be able to

124
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,060
altogether you're gonna be able to
 

125
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,520
altogether you're gonna be able to
follow the screen you're gonna be able

126
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,530
follow the screen you're gonna be able
 

127
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,830
follow the screen you're gonna be able
to follow the steps and it's going to be

128
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,840
to follow the steps and it's going to be
 

129
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,070
to follow the steps and it's going to be
exactly the same

130
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,080
exactly the same
 

131
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,810
exactly the same
that is amazing so this week I'm going

132
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:02,820
that is amazing so this week I'm going
 

133
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,690
that is amazing so this week I'm going
to be looking at how to set up port

134
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:05,700
to be looking at how to set up port
 

135
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,490
to be looking at how to set up port
forwarding we're gonna call it now

136
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:07,500
forwarding we're gonna call it now
 

137
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,260
forwarding we're gonna call it now
mikrotik is going to call it NAT

138
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:09,270
mikrotik is going to call it NAT
 

139
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,199
mikrotik is going to call it NAT
firewall rules I'm gonna talk a little

140
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,209
firewall rules I'm gonna talk a little
 

141
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,420
firewall rules I'm gonna talk a little
bit about that in a moment but we know

142
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:14,430
bit about that in a moment but we know
 

143
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,610
bit about that in a moment but we know
it as port forwarding or redirecting and

144
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,620
it as port forwarding or redirecting and
 

145
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,729
it as port forwarding or redirecting and
that is that when someone hits our

146
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:19,739
that is that when someone hits our
 

147
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,910
that is that when someone hits our
public IP address at a certain port if

148
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:22,920
public IP address at a certain port if
 

149
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,490
public IP address at a certain port if
it's a port that I have allowed and that

150
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,500
it's a port that I have allowed and that
 

151
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,800
it's a port that I have allowed and that
I recognize I want it to reroute to the

152
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:27,810
I recognize I want it to reroute to the
 

153
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,440
I recognize I want it to reroute to the
appropriate server so in my case I have

154
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,450
appropriate server so in my case I have
 

155
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,920
appropriate server so in my case I have
a server at 10.0.0.0

156
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:35,930

 

157
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,699

I going to allow them to access but then
 

239
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,490
I going to allow them to access but then
it's still not going to work unlike a

whatever they want to do as soon as you
 

251
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,350
whatever they want to do as soon as you
say go the the mikrotik is going to say

say go the the mikrotik is going to say
 

253
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,749

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,850
however they are subject to some rules
you may have some other rules that

you may have some other rules that

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,559
you may have some other rules that
you've added to your mikrotik device

you've added to your mikrotik device
 

261
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,369
you've added to your mikrotik device
that say I'm only going to allow a

262
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:08,379
that say I'm only going to allow a
 

263
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,980
that say I'm only going to allow a
particular IP address to access this so

264
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:11,990
particular IP address to access this so
 

265
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,170
particular IP address to access this so
that might be my home IP address or my

266
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,180
that might be my home IP address or my
 

267
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,019
that might be my home IP address or my
office it may be that I've set up a rule

268
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:17,029
office it may be that I've set up a rule
 

269
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,129
office it may be that I've set up a rule
that says I never travel I'm always in

270
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:21,139
that says I never travel I'm always in

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,890
that says I never travel I'm always in
Canada I'm always in fact in Ontario so

272
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:23,900
Canada I'm always in fact in Ontario so
 

273
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,959
Canada I'm always in fact in Ontario so
if anyone ever tries to access my

00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:25,969
if anyone ever tries to access my
 

275
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,570
if anyone ever tries to access my
servers from outside of Ontario block

276
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:28,580
servers from outside of Ontario block
 

277
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,809
servers from outside of Ontario block
them but open it for me if I'm in

278
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:31,819
them but open it for me if I'm in
 

279
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,930
them but open it for me if I'm in
Ontario so like there's all kinds of

280
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:34,940
Ontario so like there's all kinds of
 

281
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,899

like it's a hierarchal kind of way of

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:38,860
like it's a hierarchal kind of way of
looking

284
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:38,870
looking
 

285
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,390
looking
at those router reto rules to redirect

286
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,400
at those router reto rules to redirect
 

287
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,310
at those router reto rules to redirect
traffic to certain servers within your

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,320
traffic to certain servers within your
 

289
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,439
traffic to certain servers within your
network you can imagine that's helpful

290
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:47,449
network you can imagine that's helpful
 

291
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,939
network you can imagine that's helpful
for home because it's giving you more

292
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:48,949
for home because it's giving you more
 

293
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,189
for home because it's giving you more
security but it's also exceptional for

294
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
security but it's also exceptional for

business it whether you own or run an IT

296
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:54,860
business it whether you own or run an IT

business or even a large business

business or even a large business
mikrotik is going to give you so much

302
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,250
mikrotik is going to give you so much
 

303
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,110
mikrotik is going to give you so much
more control over those kinds of rules

304
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,120
more control over those kinds of rules
 

305
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,719
more control over those kinds of rules
so let's start with our nat rule and

306
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:07,729
so let's start with our nat rule and
 

307
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:11,409
so let's start with our nat rule and
again NAT is a short form term that we

308
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:11,419
again NAT is a short form term that we
 

309
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:13,300
again NAT is a short form term that we
use a stands for network address

310
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,310
use a stands for network address
 

311

use a stands for network address
translation and it basically tells our

312
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:15,830
translation and it basically tells our
 

313
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,120
translation and it basically tells our
network traffic where to flow based on

314
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,130
network traffic where to flow based on
 

315
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,790
network traffic where to flow based on
the rules that I've set up but they're

316
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:21,800
the rules that I've set up but they're
 

317
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,440
the rules that I've set up but they're
still not going to be allowed I'm going

318
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,450
still not going to be allowed I'm going
 

319
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,670
still not going to be allowed I'm going
to show you that in just a couple of

320
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:24,680
to show you that in just a couple of
 

321
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,950
to show you that in just a couple of
moments time so I know that I'm gonna

322
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
moments time so I know that I'm gonna
 

323
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,570
moments time so I know that I'm gonna
need port 80 and port 443 to route my

324
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:31,580
need port 80 and port 443 to route my
 

325
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,670
need port 80 and port 443 to route my
traffic for next cloud and I should

326
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
traffic for next cloud and I should
 

327
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,770
traffic for next cloud and I should
start by showing you that hey if I

328
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:35,780
start by showing you that hey if I
 

329
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,740
start by showing you that hey if I
actually go to studio dot category-five

330
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:38,750
actually go to studio dot category-five
 

331
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,100
actually go to studio dot category-five
dot TV it's just gonna hang it's gonna

332
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,110
dot TV it's just gonna hang it's gonna
 

333
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,140
dot TV it's just gonna hang it's gonna
timeout it's not gonna go anywhere

334
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,150
timeout it's not gonna go anywhere
 

335
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,690
timeout it's not gonna go anywhere
because I haven't set up those rules yet

336
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:46,700
because I haven't set up those rules yet
 

337
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,020
because I haven't set up those rules yet
so that spin spin spin spin spin but

338
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,030
so that spin spin spin spin spin but
 

339
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,980
so that spin spin spin spin spin but
I'll leave that open

340
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:50,990
I'll leave that open
 

341
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,740
I'll leave that open
so my nat rule first of all i've created

342
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:53,750
so my nat rule first of all i've created
 

343
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,629
so my nat rule first of all i've created
a new nat rule so IP firewall nat new

344
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
a new nat rule so IP firewall nat new
 

345
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,600
a new nat rule so IP firewall nat new
rule and now I'm gonna change the chain

346
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,610
rule and now I'm gonna change the chain
 

347
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,700
rule and now I'm gonna change the chain
here I want to say it say that this is

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:03,710
here I want to say it say that this is
 

349
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,650
here I want to say it say that this is
the destination map because I'm setting

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:05,660
the destination map because I'm setting
 

351

the destination within my internal
 

353
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,719
the destination within my internal
network I need to also set the protocol

354
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:10,729
network I need to also set the protocol
 

355
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,219
network I need to also set the protocol
because I want to specify that this is

because I want to specify that this is
 

357
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,279
because I want to specify that this is
actually TCP and you can see that there

358
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,289
actually TCP and you can see that there
 

359
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,960
actually TCP and you can see that there
are tons of protocols that you can

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:16,970
are tons of protocols that you can
 

361
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,080
are tons of protocols that you can
choose from I'm just setting up TCP on

router I think there's a misconception

382
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:47,329
router I think there's a misconception
 

383
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:49,660
router I think there's a misconception
as soon as I say install wind box and

384
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:49,670
as soon as I say install wind box and

as soon as I say install wind box and
use that to connect to your rhetoric

386

use that to connect to your rhetoric
 

387
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,330
use that to connect to your rhetoric

that makes you feel like oh this has to
 

391
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,160
that makes you feel like oh this has to
be managed from a tool no but that's a

392
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,170
be managed from a tool no but that's a
 

393
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,510
be managed from a tool no but that's a
helpful tool to be able to give you

394
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:58,520
helpful tool to be able to give you
 

395
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
helpful tool to be able to give you
access to your router and it does

396
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:00,530
access to your router and it does
 

397
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,710
access to your router and it does
provide some exceptional additional

services like my multitasking so give it

400
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:05,840
services like my multitasking so give it
 

401
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,780
services like my multitasking so give it
a try but I'm gonna do most of this

402
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:07,790
a try but I'm gonna do most of this
 

403
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,030
a try but I'm gonna do most of this
through the browser because I think that

404
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,040
through the browser because I think that
 

405
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,310
through the browser because I think that
that's a better way to show you as

406
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
that's a better way to show you as
 

407
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,650
that's a better way to show you as
you're just learning your Microtech so

408
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:14,660
you're just learning your Microtech so
 

409
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,930
you're just learning your Microtech so
I've set it to destination that I've set

410
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:16,940
I've set it to destination that I've set
 

411
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,230
I've set it to destination that I've set
it to TCP as the protocol which is

412
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
it to TCP as the protocol which is
 

413
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,910
it to TCP as the protocol which is
number six and I need to set my

414
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
number six and I need to set my
 

415
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,250
number six and I need to set my
destination port and this destination

416
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,260
destination port and this destination
 

417
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,300
destination port and this destination
port is the port on the external network

418
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,310
port is the port on the external network
 

419
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,670
port is the port on the external network
so don't get confused with that which I

420
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:30,680
so don't get confused with that which I
 

421
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,240
so don't get confused with that which I
tend to sometimes do because sometimes

422
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,250
tend to sometimes do because sometimes
 

423
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,400
tend to sometimes do because sometimes
you may have a situation where your

424
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,410
you may have a situation where your
 

425
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,710
you may have a situation where your
public port is different than the

426
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
public port is different than the
 

427
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,500
public port is different than the
private port in this case as we're

428
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,510
private port in this case as we're
 

429
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,510
private port in this case as we're
setting up our NAT rule we are setting

430
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:43,520
setting up our NAT rule we are setting
 

431
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,990
setting up our NAT rule we are setting
the external port here so in in my case

432
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,000
the external port here so in in my case
 

433
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,060
the external port here so in in my case
it's going to match the internal port

434
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,070
it's going to match the internal port
 

435
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,130
it's going to match the internal port
but just keep that in mind that this

436
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,140
but just keep that in mind that this
 

437
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,680
but just keep that in mind that this
let's say your we want it to answer on

438
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,690
let's say your we want it to answer on
 

439
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,280
let's say your we want it to answer on
port 8080 you could add that there even

440
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,290
port 8080 you could add that there even
 

441
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,010
port 8080 you could add that there even
though the server in house is responding

442
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,020
though the server in house is responding
 

443
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,580
though the server in house is responding
on port 80 so just keep in mind that

444
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:03,590
on port 80 so just keep in mind that
 

445
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,830
on port 80 so just keep in mind that
might be different but in my case it's

446
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:05,840
might be different but in my case it's
 

447
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,620
might be different but in my case it's
in fact not different alright I need to

448
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,630
in fact not different alright I need to
 

449
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,340
in fact not different alright I need to
look at my interface so there's the in

450
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,350
look at my interface so there's the in
 

451
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,100
look at my interface so there's the in
interface I need to say this is going to

452
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,110
interface I need to say this is going to
 

453
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,820
interface I need to say this is going to
be Ethernet one in my case it may be a

454
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:18,830
be Ethernet one in my case it may be a
 

455
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,350
be Ethernet one in my case it may be a
little bit different for you just keep

456
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,360
little bit different for you just keep
 

457
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,940
little bit different for you just keep
in mind that what I am actually doing

458
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:21,950
in mind that what I am actually doing
 

459
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,640
in mind that what I am actually doing
there as I am selecting my internet

series I demonstrated that I was

466
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:33,380
series I demonstrated that I was
 

467
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,480
series I demonstrated that I was
plugging my internet modem into Ethernet

468
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,490
plugging my internet modem into Ethernet
 

469
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,150
plugging my internet modem into Ethernet
one port one and so that's what I'm

470
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
one port one and so that's what I'm
 

471
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,400
one port one and so that's what I'm
specifying here I want this to respond

472
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,410
specifying here I want this to respond
 

473
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,300
specifying here I want this to respond
on my internet interface and as you can

474
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,310
on my internet interface and as you can
 

475
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,670
on my internet interface and as you can
imagine you can dig deep and you can set

476
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,680
imagine you can dig deep and you can set
 

477
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,530
imagine you can dig deep and you can set
this up on you know you could be doing

478
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,540
this up on you know you could be doing
 

479
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,580
this up on you know you could be doing
things very sophisticated by specifying

480
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:54,590
things very sophisticated by specifying
 

481
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,010
things very sophisticated by specifying
different ports setting up VLANs all

482
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,020
different ports setting up VLANs all
 

483
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,270
different ports setting up VLANs all
that kind of stuff we're keeping things

484
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,280
that kind of stuff we're keeping things
 

485
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,760
that kind of stuff we're keeping things
fairly simple and just going about it

486
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:00,770
fairly simple and just going about it
 

487
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,480
fairly simple and just going about it
that way all right I'm gonna scroll Wade

488
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,490
that way all right I'm gonna scroll Wade
 

489
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,019
that way all right I'm gonna scroll Wade
here - action and just make sure that

490
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:08,029
here - action and just make sure that
 

491
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:14,710
here - action and just make sure that
this is set to DN DST net destination

492
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
this is set to DN DST net destination
 

493
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,889
this is set to DN DST net destination
net so that is going to route this

494
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:17,899
net so that is going to route this
 

495
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,460
net so that is going to route this
traffic to our server so now scroll down

496
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:21,470
traffic to our server so now scroll down
 

497
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,110
traffic to our server so now scroll down
a little ways here and you're gonna find

498
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
a little ways here and you're gonna find
 

499
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,280
a little ways here and you're gonna find
two ports there it is my two port is

500
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,290
two ports there it is my two port is
 

501
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,510
two ports there it is my two port is
actually going to be the same notice

502
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:31,520
actually going to be the same notice
 

503
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,670
actually going to be the same notice
that's giving me a range I'm just going

504
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
that's giving me a range I'm just going
 

505
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,970
that's giving me a range I'm just going
to specify port 80 and at the very very

506
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:36,980
to specify port 80 and at the very very
 

507
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,829
to specify port 80 and at the very very
bottom here there's an opportunity for

508
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:38,839
bottom here there's an opportunity for
 

509
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,690
bottom here there's an opportunity for
you to create a comment I'm going to do

510
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:40,700
you to create a comment I'm going to do
 

511
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,370
you to create a comment I'm going to do
that I'm gonna say next cloud 80 finally

512
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:45,380
that I'm gonna say next cloud 80 finally
 

513
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,410
that I'm gonna say next cloud 80 finally
the one last thing that I need to add

514
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:47,420
the one last thing that I need to add
 

515
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,760
the one last thing that I need to add
here is the destination IP address

516
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:50,770
here is the destination IP address
 

517
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,949
here is the destination IP address
internally on my network this is the

518
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:53,959
internally on my network this is the
 

519
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,030
internally on my network this is the
server as I mentioned 1000 to say that

520
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,040
server as I mentioned 1000 to say that
 

521
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,329
server as I mentioned 1000 to say that
this NAT rule is going to respond on

522
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:01,339
this NAT rule is going to respond on
 

523
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:08,829
this NAT rule is going to respond on
port 80 and redirect to 10.0.0.0 so now

524
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
port 80 and redirect to 10.0.0.0 so now
 

525
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,280
port 80 and redirect to 10.0.0.0 so now
I'm going to scroll all the way up and

526
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,290
I'm going to scroll all the way up and
 

527
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,800
I'm going to scroll all the way up and
hit OK and now we'll see that we have a

528
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:14,810
hit OK and now we'll see that we have a
 

529
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,470
hit OK and now we'll see that we have a
new rule called next cloud 80 and it's

530
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:17,480
new rule called next cloud 80 and it's
 

531
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,579
new rule called next cloud 80 and it's
responding DST net and it's pointing TCP

532
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:21,589
responding DST net and it's pointing TCP
 

533
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,780
responding DST net and it's pointing TCP
on port 80 through Ethernet one - as we

534
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:25,790
on port 80 through Ethernet one - as we
 

535
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:32,800
on port 80 through Ethernet one - as we
know from setting it up 10.0.0.0 secure

536
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:32,810
know from setting it up 10.0.0.0 secure
 

537
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,350
know from setting it up 10.0.0.0 secure
port as well follow those same steps I'm

538
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
port as well follow those same steps I'm
 

539
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,630
port as well follow those same steps I'm
going to change the chain to destination

540
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:37,640
going to change the chain to destination
 

541
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,230
going to change the chain to destination
that I'm gonna change my protocol to TCP

542
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,240
that I'm gonna change my protocol to TCP
 

543
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,340
that I'm gonna change my protocol to TCP
and then I'm going to change my external

544
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,350
and then I'm going to change my external
 

545
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:55,199
and then I'm going to change my external
my in interface to Ethernet one

546
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:55,209

 

547
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,090

destination port I know I'm a little bit

548
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,100
destination port I know I'm a little bit
 

549
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,250
destination port I know I'm a little bit
out of order that's okay you know what

550
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,260
out of order that's okay you know what
 

551
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,199
out of order that's okay you know what
I'm doing destination port is 4 4 3

552
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:02,209
I'm doing destination port is 4 4 3
 

553
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,810
I'm doing destination port is 4 4 3
let's scroll way down here and change

554
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:04,820
let's scroll way down here and change
 

555
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,560
let's scroll way down here and change
our action to DST nat and our to address

556
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,570
our action to DST nat and our to address
 

557
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,430
our action to DST nat and our to address
same server just different port and then

558
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
same server just different port and then
 

559
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,250
same server just different port and then
to port 443 and give it a comment here

560
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:23,260
to port 443 and give it a comment here
 

561
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,540
to port 443 and give it a comment here
next cloud 443 all right I think I've

562
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:28,550
next cloud 443 all right I think I've
 

563
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,140
next cloud 443 all right I think I've
got everything there looks good let's

564
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,150
got everything there looks good let's
 

565
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,000
got everything there looks good let's
hit OK so now I've got port 80 and port

566
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,010
hit OK so now I've got port 80 and port
 

567
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:44,110
hit OK so now I've got port 80 and port
443 NAT rules going to 10.0.0.0 net1

568
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,120
443 NAT rules going to 10.0.0.0 net1
 

569
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,010
443 NAT rules going to 10.0.0.0 net1
port over tcp it's still not gonna work

570
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,020
port over tcp it's still not gonna work
 

571
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,460
port over tcp it's still not gonna work
so if i jump over here i'm gonna hit f5

572
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:51,470
so if i jump over here i'm gonna hit f5
 

573
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,220
so if i jump over here i'm gonna hit f5
to refresh oh and it is working look at

574
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,230
to refresh oh and it is working look at
 

575
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,160
to refresh oh and it is working look at
that because i'm internal on the

576
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,170
that because i'm internal on the
 

577
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,019
that because i'm internal on the
internal land so i'm not actually on the

578
00:13:59,019 --> 00:13:59,029
internal land so i'm not actually on the
 

579
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,790
internal land so i'm not actually on the
ethernet one it's not going to work from

580
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
ethernet one it's not going to work from
 

581
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,670
ethernet one it's not going to work from
the outside world yet because the

582
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
the outside world yet because the
 

583
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,240
the outside world yet because the
outside world is is coming in through

584
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,250
outside world is is coming in through
 

585
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,480
outside world is is coming in through
ethernet one I'm obviously internal I'm

586
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,490
ethernet one I'm obviously internal I'm
 

587
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,120
ethernet one I'm obviously internal I'm
on port 2 as you'll remember from last

588
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,130
on port 2 as you'll remember from last
 

589
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,269
on port 2 as you'll remember from last
week so in order to give access to the

590
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:16,279
week so in order to give access to the
 

591
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,460
week so in order to give access to the
outside world now I need to go over to

592
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:18,470
outside world now I need to go over to
 

593
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,120
outside world now I need to go over to
the firewall rules tab here and click on

594
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,130
the firewall rules tab here and click on
 

595
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,920
the firewall rules tab here and click on
add new so this is where I'm actually

596
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:23,930
add new so this is where I'm actually
 

597
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,889
add new so this is where I'm actually
saying ok if the firewall gets hit I

598
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:26,899
saying ok if the firewall gets hit I
 

599
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,160
saying ok if the firewall gets hit I
need to trigger that nat rule so let's

600
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,170
need to trigger that nat rule so let's
 

601
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,939
need to trigger that nat rule so let's
do that so we've added a new firewall

602
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:33,949
do that so we've added a new firewall
 

603
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,900
do that so we've added a new firewall
rule and I'm gonna change the chain

604
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:36,910
rule and I'm gonna change the chain
 

605
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,760
rule and I'm gonna change the chain
let's see no it's already defaulting to

606
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:39,770
let's see no it's already defaulting to
 

607
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,460
let's see no it's already defaulting to
forward so that's fine

608
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,470
forward so that's fine
 

609
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,480
forward so that's fine
source IP address this is kind of cool

610
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,490
source IP address this is kind of cool
 

611
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,120
source IP address this is kind of cool
I'm not going to set this but I just

612
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,130
I'm not going to set this but I just
 

613
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,490
I'm not going to set this but I just
want to I want you to see this this can

614
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:51,500
want to I want you to see this this can
 

615
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,819
want to I want you to see this this can
be the IP address that you want to allow

616
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:54,829
be the IP address that you want to allow
 

617
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,319
be the IP address that you want to allow
remember I mentioned you could set it so

618
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:56,329
remember I mentioned you could set it so
 

619
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,880
remember I mentioned you could set it so
that only your home network is allowed

620
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:57,890
that only your home network is allowed
 

621
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,010
that only your home network is allowed
to do this you could do that add your

622
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,020
to do this you could do that add your
 

623
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,199
to do this you could do that add your
home IP address you can even create

624
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:02,209
home IP address you can even create
 

625
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,920
home IP address you can even create
IP groups that would that would be set

626
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:05,930
IP groups that would that would be set
 

627
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,860
IP groups that would that would be set
up here that's down here source address

628
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:08,870
up here that's down here source address
 

629
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,650
up here that's down here source address
list see that so these are things that

630
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:11,660
list see that so these are things that
 

631
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,420
list see that so these are things that
we're gonna be learning in time right

632
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:13,430
we're gonna be learning in time right
 

633
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,470
we're gonna be learning in time right
now I'm not going to do that I'm not

634
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
now I'm not going to do that I'm not
 

635
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,660
now I'm not going to do that I'm not
gonna set a source address I'm going to

636
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,670
gonna set a source address I'm going to
 

637
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,970
gonna set a source address I'm going to
open this up to the world but I want you

638
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:18,980
open this up to the world but I want you
 

639
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,400
open this up to the world but I want you
to know that that is available to you so

640
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,410
to know that that is available to you so
 

641
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,100
to know that that is available to you so
moving along destination I address is in

642
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,110
moving along destination I address is in
 

643
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,439
moving along destination I address is in
fact the internal server so that's 10

644
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:28,449
fact the internal server so that's 10
 

645
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:31,900
fact the internal server so that's 10
0.017 protocol we already know that is

646
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,910
0.017 protocol we already know that is
 

647
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,850
0.017 protocol we already know that is
TCP so click that and it TCP is in fact

648
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:36,860
TCP so click that and it TCP is in fact
 

649
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,350
TCP so click that and it TCP is in fact
the default so that just kind of saves

650
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:38,360
the default so that just kind of saves
 

651
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,569
the default so that just kind of saves
us a quick time but you can see all the

652
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:40,579
us a quick time but you can see all the
 

653
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:44,410
us a quick time but you can see all the
protocols that are available to us next

654
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:44,420
protocols that are available to us next
 

655
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,019
protocols that are available to us next
step is we need to set the service port

656
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:47,029
step is we need to set the service port
 

657
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,449
step is we need to set the service port
so destination port is going to be port

658
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:52,459
so destination port is going to be port
 

659
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,699
so destination port is going to be port
80 we're gonna start with we need to do

660
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:54,709
80 we're gonna start with we need to do
 

661
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:57,329
80 we're gonna start with we need to do
both but I need to set up each rule

662
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:57,339
both but I need to set up each rule
 

663
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,629
both but I need to set up each rule
separately so there we go in interface

664
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:01,639
separately so there we go in interface
 

665
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,600
separately so there we go in interface
is going to be my Ethernet 1 port as we

666
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:04,610
is going to be my Ethernet 1 port as we
 

667
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,590
is going to be my Ethernet 1 port as we
already established and so what I'm

668
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:08,600
already established and so what I'm
 

669
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,359
already established and so what I'm
doing here is I'm actually telling the

670
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:10,369
doing here is I'm actually telling the
 

671
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,269
doing here is I'm actually telling the
firewall that I'm going to allow this

672
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
firewall that I'm going to allow this
 

673
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,419
firewall that I'm going to allow this
traffic from the the first Ethernet port

674
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:19,429
traffic from the the first Ethernet port
 

675
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,249
traffic from the the first Ethernet port
which is my internet connection and this

676
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:21,259
which is my internet connection and this
 

677
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,379
which is my internet connection and this
is the one where action needs to be set

678
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:23,389
is the one where action needs to be set
 

679
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:25,419
is the one where action needs to be set
to accept so this is where I'm saying

680
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:25,429
to accept so this is where I'm saying
 

681
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:27,369
to accept so this is where I'm saying
yeah you know what I'm going to allow

682
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:27,379
yeah you know what I'm going to allow
 

683
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,290
yeah you know what I'm going to allow
this you could also set this to reject

684
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:29,300
this you could also set this to reject
 

685
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,900
this you could also set this to reject
in certain cases or you know various

686
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:31,910
in certain cases or you know various
 

687
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,579
in certain cases or you know various
different settings but we're gonna say

688
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:33,589
different settings but we're gonna say
 

689
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,579
different settings but we're gonna say
except we're going to allow this and

690
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:35,589
except we're going to allow this and
 

691
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,860
except we're going to allow this and
then create a comment just like we did

692
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:38,870
then create a comment just like we did
 

693
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,079
then create a comment just like we did
before I'm gonna call this firewall rule

694
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:41,089
before I'm gonna call this firewall rule
 

695
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,369

well you're missing some of the chains
 

703
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,189
well you're missing some of the chains
so it's not going to actually respond

704

so it's not going to actually respond
 

705
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,809
so it's not going to actually respond
outside of your network so you need to

there we go everything looks like I've

734
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:42,729
there we go everything looks like I've
 

735
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,909
there we go everything looks like I've
got everything in there I miss anything

736
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:44,919
got everything in there I miss anything
 

737
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,269
got everything in there I miss anything
folks you tell me I'm gonna hit ok so

738
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:48,279
folks you tell me I'm gonna hit ok so
 

739
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,659
folks you tell me I'm gonna hit ok so
now here's the final step you notice

740
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:51,669
now here's the final step you notice
 

741
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,659
now here's the final step you notice
that these two items here are drop

742
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:54,669
that these two items here are drop
 

743
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:59,279
that these two items here are drop
forward rules in the fire law now it's

744
00:17:59,279 --> 00:17:59,289
forward rules in the fire law now it's
 

745
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,089
forward rules in the fire law now it's
important to note that mikrotik works in

746
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:02,099
important to note that mikrotik works in
 

747
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,729
important to note that mikrotik works in
it basically in order so from top to

748
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:05,739
it basically in order so from top to
 

749
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:07,830
it basically in order so from top to
bottom so when you're looking at your

750
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
bottom so when you're looking at your
 

751
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,109
bottom so when you're looking at your
firewall rules if you're wondering why

752
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:10,119
firewall rules if you're wondering why
 

753
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,969
firewall rules if you're wondering why
are these still not working well it's

754
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:11,979
are these still not working well it's
 

755
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:15,539
are these still not working well it's
because before my rules that I just

756
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:15,549
because before my rules that I just
 

757
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,969
because before my rules that I just
configured there's already a rule that

758
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:17,979
configured there's already a rule that
 

759
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:20,729
configured there's already a rule that
says drop everything so basically this

760
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:20,739
says drop everything so basically this
 

761
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,379
says drop everything so basically this
is saying hey if you've passed all this

762
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:22,389
is saying hey if you've passed all this
 

763
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,499
is saying hey if you've passed all this
past all this past all this now drop the

764
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:25,509
past all this past all this now drop the
 

765
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,810
past all this past all this now drop the
connection right because these that's a

766
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:27,820
connection right because these that's a
 

767
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,969
connection right because these that's a
pretty solid firewall well then it never
