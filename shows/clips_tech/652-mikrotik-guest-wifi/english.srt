00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:12,570
slash mikrotik now that our network is

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,570
slash mikrotik now that our network is
up and running let's create a guest

10
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:14,580
up and running let's create a guest
 

11
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,310
up and running let's create a guest
Wi-Fi SSID our guest Wi-Fi will have a

12
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:19,320
Wi-Fi SSID our guest Wi-Fi will have a
 

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,490
Wi-Fi SSID our guest Wi-Fi will have a
throttled connection to the Internet and

14
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:21,500
throttled connection to the Internet and
 

15
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,250
throttled connection to the Internet and
they will not have access to our local

16
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,260
they will not have access to our local
 

17
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,830
they will not have access to our local
resources so that's network shares

18
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
resources so that's network shares
 

19
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,439
resources so that's network shares
printers things like that I want to lock

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:30,449
printers things like that I want to lock
 

21
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,049
printers things like that I want to lock
that down we're gonna create a truly

00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:33,059
that down we're gonna create a truly
 

23
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,270
that down we're gonna create a truly
isolated Wi-Fi connection to allow

that's particularly what I don't want to
 

93
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,399
that's particularly what I don't want to
be giving out so let's do that right now

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:01,409
be giving out so let's do that right now
 

95
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,200
be giving out so let's do that right now
let's set up a separate password by

96
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,210
let's set up a separate password by
 

97
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,969
let's set up a separate password by
clicking on wireless at the left here

98
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:04,979
clicking on wireless at the left here
 

99
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,100
clicking on wireless at the left here
and then I'm going to click on security

100
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,110
and then I'm going to click on security
 

101
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,630
and then I'm going to click on security
profiles at the top now click on add new

and you'll see default is actually my my

104
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:13,830
and you'll see default is actually my my
 

105
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,890
and you'll see default is actually my my
you network so that's the password for

106
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:15,900
you network so that's the password for
 

107
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,350
you network so that's the password for
my network the Wi-Fi that I've already

108
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,360
my network the Wi-Fi that I've already
 

109
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
my network the Wi-Fi that I've already
set up and I'm gonna click add new and

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,370
set up and I'm gonna click add new and
 

111
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,330
set up and I'm gonna click add new and
we're just going to call this one guest

112
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,340
we're just going to call this one guest
 

113
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,410
we're just going to call this one guest
just like that

114
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:24,420
just like that
 

115
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,050
just like that
one note is I want to turn off WPA PSK

116
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,060
one note is I want to turn off WPA PSK
 

117
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,100
one note is I want to turn off WPA PSK
because WPA as you know is very part of

118
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,110
because WPA as you know is very part of
 

119
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,260
because WPA as you know is very part of
me it's very easy to compromise so we

120
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,270
me it's very easy to compromise so we
 

121
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,260
me it's very easy to compromise so we
don't want to use WPA we only want to

122
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,270
don't want to use WPA we only want to
 

123
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,450
don't want to use WPA we only want to
use wpa2 because wpa2 is much safer as

124
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:41,460
use wpa2 because wpa2 is much safer as
 

125
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,230
use wpa2 because wpa2 is much safer as
far as somebody being able to hack into

126
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,240
far as somebody being able to hack into
 

127
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,100
far as somebody being able to hack into
your Wi-Fi network so turn off WPA PSK

128
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,110
your Wi-Fi network so turn off WPA PSK
 

129
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,240
your Wi-Fi network so turn off WPA PSK
leave wpa2 PSK enabled and then down

130
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,250
leave wpa2 PSK enabled and then down
 

131
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,220
leave wpa2 PSK enabled and then down
here because that is enabled we need to

132
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,230
here because that is enabled we need to
 

133
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,920
here because that is enabled we need to
enter a pre-shared key aka the password

134
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:57,930
enter a pre-shared key aka the password
 

135
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,760
enter a pre-shared key aka the password
for our network so I'm gonna use dum-dum

136
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:00,770
for our network so I'm gonna use dum-dum
 

137
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,680
for our network so I'm gonna use dum-dum
one-two-three-four this guest Wi-Fi so

138
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,690
one-two-three-four this guest Wi-Fi so
 

139
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,040
one-two-three-four this guest Wi-Fi so
this is only for the guest Wi-Fi

140
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,050
this is only for the guest Wi-Fi
 

141
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,020
this is only for the guest Wi-Fi
remember that ok once I've entered my

142
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,030
remember that ok once I've entered my
 

143
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,050
remember that ok once I've entered my
password I'm going to hit ok so I

144
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,060
password I'm going to hit ok so I
 

145
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,210
password I'm going to hit ok so I
haven't actually created a network yet

146
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,220
haven't actually created a network yet
 

147
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,670
haven't actually created a network yet
all I've done is I've created a security

148
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:16,680
all I've done is I've created a security
 

149
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,190
all I've done is I've created a security
profile called guest and that security

150
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
profile called guest and that security
 

151
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,870
profile called guest and that security
profile contains the wpa2 shared key for

152
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:23,880
profile contains the wpa2 shared key for
 

153
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,360
profile contains the wpa2 shared key for
that guest Network and I notice that my

154
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,370
that guest Network and I notice that my
 

155
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,479
that guest Network and I notice that my
default network is in fact using WPA pre

156
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:29,489

157
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,550
default network is in fact using WPA pre
shared key so while we're here let's

158
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,560
shared key so while we're here let's
 

159
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,780
shared key so while we're here let's
open that one and let's turn off WPA PSK

160
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,790
open that one and let's turn off WPA PSK
 

161
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,690
open that one and let's turn off WPA PSK
because I do not want someone hacking

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:38,700
because I do not want someone hacking

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,560
because I do not want someone hacking
into my main network and hit OK it only

simply the encryption algorithm has
changed so now as you can see on the

186
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:10,350
networks and I want to add a new one for
 

187
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,310

my guest Wi-Fi but I don't have another
 

189
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,960
my guest Wi-Fi but I don't have another
radio so what are we gonna do we're

190
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:14,970
radio so what are we gonna do we're
 

191
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,750
radio so what are we gonna do we're
going to share the radio with one of my

192
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:17,760
going to share the radio with one of my
 

193
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,780
going to share the radio with one of my
w lands so we're not going to add

194
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:20,790
w lands so we're not going to add
 

195
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,760
w lands so we're not going to add
another radio we don't have to buy an

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:26,830
we're just going to use the same
 

201
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,760
we're just going to use the same
mikrotik router so the only caveat of

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:29,770
mikrotik router so the only caveat of
 

203
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,400
mikrotik router so the only caveat of
that is that it means that the guest

204
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,410
that is that it means that the guest

Wi-Fi for our network however because
 

211
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,980
Wi-Fi for our network however because
it's a different network and it's a

it's a different network and it's a

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,060
think it does alright let's go add new
and we're gonna choose virtual because

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,070
and we're gonna choose virtual because
 

227
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,000
and we're gonna choose virtual because
we are not creating a real one now we're

228
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,010
we are not creating a real one now we're
 

229
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,640
we are not creating a real one now we're
creating a virtual network here on our

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:05,650
creating a virtual network here on our
 

231
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,879
creating a virtual network here on our
wireless tab in Wi-Fi interfaces so

00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:08,889
wireless tab in Wi-Fi interfaces so
 

233
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,360
wireless tab in Wi-Fi interfaces so
let's create a virtual interface first

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,030
something fun for your guests Wi-Fi you
 

249
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,150
something fun for your guests Wi-Fi you
can do that but for the sake of making

250
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
can do that but for the sake of making
 

251
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,820
can do that but for the sake of making
this tutorial universally accessible and

252
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:32,830
this tutorial universally accessible and
 

253
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,520
this tutorial universally accessible and
easy to follow I'm using guests because

254
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:35,530
easy to follow I'm using guests because
 

255
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,500
easy to follow I'm using guests because
anyone can go through these steps and

256
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,510
anyone can go through these steps and
 

257
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,540
anyone can go through these steps and
then retrace and rename things if you

258
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,550
then retrace and rename things if you
 

259
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,020
then retrace and rename things if you
want to but you don't have to do that so

260
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,030
want to but you don't have to do that so
 

261
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,960
want to but you don't have to do that so
on this network let's scroll down just a

262
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:45,970
on this network let's scroll down just a
 

263
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,310
on this network let's scroll down just a
little ways and we're going to see

264
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:47,320
little ways and we're going to see
 

265
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,120
little ways and we're going to see
something here called SSID we know that

266
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,130
something here called SSID we know that
 

267
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,790
something here called SSID we know that
the SSID for our network is basically

268
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:53,800
the SSID for our network is basically
 

269
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,710
the SSID for our network is basically
what you see when you bring up your

270
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:55,720
what you see when you bring up your
 

271
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,050
what you see when you bring up your
phone and you access the Wi-Fi and you

272
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,060
phone and you access the Wi-Fi and you
 

273
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,820
phone and you access the Wi-Fi and you
see a list of the different networks so

274
00:05:59,820 --> 00:05:59,830
see a list of the different networks so
 

275
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,779
see a list of the different networks so
right now I see cat 5 TV and cat 5 TV -

276
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:03,789
right now I see cat 5 TV and cat 5 TV -
 

277
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,719
right now I see cat 5 TV and cat 5 TV -
5g and about a billion other Wi-Fi

278
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:06,729
5g and about a billion other Wi-Fi
 

279
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:09,210
5g and about a billion other Wi-Fi
networks around me but I want to give

280
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,220
networks around me but I want to give
 

281
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,089
networks around me but I want to give
this one an SSID that designates this

282
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:12,099
this one an SSID that designates this
 

283
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,760
this one an SSID that designates this
the guest Wi-Fi now in our case today

284
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:14,770
the guest Wi-Fi now in our case today
 

285
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,610
the guest Wi-Fi now in our case today
I'm going to call this SSID simply

286
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:17,620
I'm going to call this SSID simply
 

287
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,490
I'm going to call this SSID simply
guessed again I'm going to refer back to

288
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:20,500
guessed again I'm going to refer back to
 

289
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,930
guessed again I'm going to refer back to
my comment that we're just making this

290
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:21,940
my comment that we're just making this
 

291
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,810
my comment that we're just making this
universally accessible but you can call

292
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:24,820
universally accessible but you can call
 

293
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,730
universally accessible but you can call
that whatever you want this could be I

294
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:26,740
that whatever you want this could be I
 

295
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,850
that whatever you want this could be I
could call this cat 5 TV - guest which

296
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:29,860
could call this cat 5 TV - guest which
 

297
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
could call this cat 5 TV - guest which
would be very appropriate because if

298
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:31,870
would be very appropriate because if
 

299
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,390
would be very appropriate because if
there's some other network called guest

300
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,400
there's some other network called guest
 

301
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,430
there's some other network called guest
because that's pretty generic that could

302
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
because that's pretty generic that could
 

303
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,670
because that's pretty generic that could
cause a conflict but also

304
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
cause a conflict but also
 

305
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,350
cause a conflict but also
it just makes it so that when people

306
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
it just makes it so that when people
 

307
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,270
it just makes it so that when people
come into the studio they can say oh

308
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
come into the studio they can say oh
 

309
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,450
come into the studio they can say oh
that's the guest Wi-Fi for cat5 TV hey

310
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:44,460
that's the guest Wi-Fi for cat5 TV hey
 

311
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,249
that's the guest Wi-Fi for cat5 TV hey
what's the password dum-dum one two

312
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:46,259
what's the password dum-dum one two
 

313
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,129
what's the password dum-dum one two
three nice and simple right but for

314
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:49,139
three nice and simple right but for
 

315
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,020
three nice and simple right but for
today's demonstration we are just gonna

316
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,030
today's demonstration we are just gonna
 

317
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,350
today's demonstration we are just gonna
go with guest and now the final thing

318
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
go with guest and now the final thing
 

319
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,879
go with guest and now the final thing
that we need to do of course is set our

320
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:55,889
that we need to do of course is set our
 

321
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,620
that we need to do of course is set our
security profile for the Wi-Fi

322
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:57,630
security profile for the Wi-Fi
 

323
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,700
security profile for the Wi-Fi
connection and we're going to change

324
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:58,710
connection and we're going to change
 

325
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,520
connection and we're going to change
that from default to guest so that's

326
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,530
that from default to guest so that's
 

327
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,050
that from default to guest so that's
gonna set so that we're using the

328
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,060
gonna set so that we're using the
 

329
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,659
gonna set so that we're using the
password dum-dum 1 2 3 as we specified

330
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:05,669
password dum-dum 1 2 3 as we specified
 

331
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,670
password dum-dum 1 2 3 as we specified
with that security profile and that's

332
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
with that security profile and that's
 

333
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,189
with that security profile and that's
literally all there is to adding the

334
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:10,199
literally all there is to adding the
 

335
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,150
literally all there is to adding the
interface hit ok now because I am making

336
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
interface hit ok now because I am making
 

337
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,689

changes to my Wi-Fi setup and because my

338
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:17,699
changes to my Wi-Fi setup and because my
 

339
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,510
changes to my Wi-Fi setup and because my
pine Book Pro is connected to my Wi-Fi

340
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:20,520
pine Book Pro is connected to my Wi-Fi
 

341
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,689
pine Book Pro is connected to my Wi-Fi
right now remember that Wi-Fi now the

00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:23,699
right now remember that Wi-Fi now the
 

343
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,850
right now remember that Wi-Fi now the
router is not rebooting my servers and

359
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,379
settings you'll see now that under
wireless Wi-Fi interfaces I have one

360
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:45,389
wireless Wi-Fi interfaces I have one
 

361
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,920
wireless Wi-Fi interfaces I have one
called guest Wi-Fi and that is a virtual

362
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:48,930
called guest Wi-Fi and that is a virtual
 

363
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,050
called guest Wi-Fi and that is a virtual

interface connecting to my Wi-Fi so the
 

365
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,580
interface connecting to my Wi-Fi so the
next thing we need to do is we need to

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:55,590
next thing we need to do is we need to
 

367
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,800
next thing we need to do is we need to
start routing how the traffic is going

368
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:57,810
start routing how the traffic is going
 

369
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,570
start routing how the traffic is going
to flow and do you get the sense here

hit okay so now as you can see we now
 

445
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,910
hit okay so now as you can see we now
have a bridge called bridge guests

so we need to actually specify how the

450
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:26,769
so we need to actually specify how the
 

451
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,470
so we need to actually specify how the
ports are going to be assigned so click

ports are going to be assigned so click
 

453
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,780
ports are going to be assigned so click
on ports and we need to actually connect

on ports and we need to actually connect
 

455
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,970
on ports and we need to actually connect
that bridge to our new guest Wi-Fi so

456
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:32,980
that bridge to our new guest Wi-Fi so
 

457
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,710
that bridge to our new guest Wi-Fi so
add new and then change the interface to

458
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:37,720
add new and then change the interface to
 

459
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,939
add new and then change the interface to
guest Wi-Fi and the bridge we don't want

460
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:41,949
guest Wi-Fi and the bridge we don't want
 

461
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,740
guest Wi-Fi and the bridge we don't want
that using our main bridge we want that

462
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:43,750
that using our main bridge we want that
 

463
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,040
that using our main bridge we want that
to go to bridge - guest and now hit OK

464
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,050

told this guest Wi-Fi the bridge what IP

told this guest Wi-Fi the bridge what IP
 

477
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,759
told this guest Wi-Fi the bridge what IP
block to use and again I'm gonna back up

separate from my private network I do
not want the guest Wi-Fi on the same IP

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
ransomware then goes out on the network
 

503
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,800
ransomware then goes out on the network
and looks for network shares and

and looks for network shares and
 

505
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,710
and looks for network shares and
encrypts all your files so even though

network that protects you
 

521
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,700

information on your network so we're
 

531
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,050
information on your network so we're
gonna protect you against that let's set

532
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,060
gonna protect you against that let's set
 

533
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,500
gonna protect you against that let's set
up an IP block for this guest Wi-Fi and

534
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:19,510
up an IP block for this guest Wi-Fi and
 

535
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,160
up an IP block for this guest Wi-Fi and
a go IP and then addresses on the

that my network is 10.0.0.0 dot zero dot
one two three four so on and Counting so

I'm gonna create a new IP block by

544
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:39,940
I'm gonna create a new IP block by
 

545
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm gonna create a new IP block by
simply clicking add new and we're gonna

546
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,490
simply clicking add new and we're gonna
 

547
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,100
simply clicking add new and we're gonna
make this one a little different so

548
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,110
make this one a little different so
 

549
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,710
make this one a little different so
we're gonna go with 10.10 dot dot one

550
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
we're gonna go with 10.10 dot dot one

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,110
field that I was talking about last week
 

559
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,329
field that I was talking about last week
that we didn't really see we don't need

560
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:03,339
that we didn't really see we don't need
 

561
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,060
that we didn't really see we don't need
that in this case but you can add

562
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,070
that in this case but you can add
 

563
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,740
that in this case but you can add
comments to anything that you add in web

564
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:07,750
comments to anything that you add in web
 

565
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,079
comments to anything that you add in web
thick hit ok so now we have a new

566
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,089
thick hit ok so now we have a new
 

567
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,900
thick hit ok so now we have a new
network here called ten ten ten dot one

568
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:12,910
network here called ten ten ten dot one
 

569
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,960
network here called ten ten ten dot one
and it will assign I well we will

570
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:15,970
and it will assign I well we will
 

571
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,880
and it will assign I well we will
inevitably when we setup a DHCP server

572
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:17,890
inevitably when we setup a DHCP server
 

573
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,610
inevitably when we setup a DHCP server
see there's lots of steps it will assign

574
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:20,620
see there's lots of steps it will assign
 

575
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,090
see there's lots of steps it will assign
IP addresses on that IP block

576
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,100
IP addresses on that IP block
 

577
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,000
IP addresses on that IP block
so speaking of DHCP server that's our

578
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,010
so speaking of DHCP server that's our
 

579
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,800
so speaking of DHCP server that's our
next step so we're gonna jump over here

580
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:28,810
next step so we're gonna jump over here
 

581
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,960
next step so we're gonna jump over here
and under IP which is already open

582
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:30,970
and under IP which is already open
 

583
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,880
and under IP which is already open
already expanded and we're gonna click

584
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:32,890
already expanded and we're gonna click
 

585
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,760
already expanded and we're gonna click
on DHCP server and here you can see my

586
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:35,770
on DHCP server and here you can see my
 

587
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,340
on DHCP server and here you can see my
current running DHCP server but the

588
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,350
current running DHCP server but the
 

589
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,870
current running DHCP server but the
thing with this is that it's got kind of

590
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:39,880
thing with this is that it's got kind of
 

591
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,850
thing with this is that it's got kind of
a weird name out of the box so I first

592
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:41,860
a weird name out of the box so I first
 

593
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,840
a weird name out of the box so I first
thing I want to do is I want to open

594
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:42,850
thing I want to do is I want to open
 

595
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,160
thing I want to do is I want to open
that and I'm just gonna rename this one

596
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,170
that and I'm just gonna rename this one
 

597
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,440
that and I'm just gonna rename this one
local and the reason I want to do that

598
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,450
local and the reason I want to do that
 

599
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,050
local and the reason I want to do that
is I want to always remind myself that

600
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:49,060
is I want to always remind myself that
 

601
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,710
is I want to always remind myself that
that DHCP pool is my local network it

602
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
that DHCP pool is my local network it
 

603
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,079
that DHCP pool is my local network it
has full access to everything on my

604
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:55,089
has full access to everything on my
 

605
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,060
has full access to everything on my
network you do not want to assign a

606
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,070
network you do not want to assign a
 

607
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,519
network you do not want to assign a
guest to that so by calling it local it

608
00:12:59,519 --> 00:12:59,529
guest to that so by calling it local it
 

609
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,810
guest to that so by calling it local it
just keeps me a little bit more safe

610
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:00,820
just keeps me a little bit more safe
 

611
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,780
just keeps me a little bit more safe
because it stands out as that is

612
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:03,790
because it stands out as that is
 

613
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,820
because it stands out as that is
definitely my local network now let's

614
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:05,830
definitely my local network now let's
 

615
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,610
definitely my local network now let's
add a new DHCP server and you can see

616
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:08,620
add a new DHCP server and you can see
 

617
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,230
add a new DHCP server and you can see
that there's all this setup that you can

618
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
that there's all this setup that you can
 

619

DHCP setup and that's going to bring up
 

629
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
DHCP setup and that's going to bring up
a wizard that is going to make this a
