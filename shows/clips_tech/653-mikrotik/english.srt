Linksys right mikrotik know I don't know

118
00:02:59,410 --> 00:02:59,420
Linksys right mikrotik know I don't know
 

119
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,180
Linksys right mikrotik know I don't know
that I've ever seen it in a super Center

120
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,190

121
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,960
that I've ever seen it in a super Center
so I think that maybe it maybe it's that

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,320
it's not that people wouldn't love it if
 

125
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,890
it's not that people wouldn't love it if
they knew about it so maybe that's why

126
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:08,900
they knew about it so maybe that's why
 

127

sure so instead I named the five
 

159
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,060
sure so instead I named the five
gigahertz not yours and the two

160
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,070
gigahertz not yours and the two
 

161
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,820
gigahertz not yours and the two
gigahertz DEA surveillance van all right

162
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:12,830
gigahertz DEA surveillance van all right
 

163
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,199
gigahertz DEA surveillance van all right
so you got two networks the five

164
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,209
so you got two networks the five
 

165
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,539
so you got two networks the five
gigahertz for your own usage and this

166
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:16,549
gigahertz for your own usage and this
 

167
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,930
gigahertz for your own usage and this
DEA surveillance ban can I suggest if

168
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:19,940
DEA surveillance ban can I suggest if
 

169
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,530

Rockaway CCW I did a tutorial on how to
 

175
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:35,149
Rockaway CCW I did a tutorial on how to
set up a true guest Wi-Fi and you could

176
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:35,159
set up a true guest Wi-Fi and you could
 

177
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:40,070
set up a true guest Wi-Fi and you could
use that virtual WLAN and then that way

178
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
use that virtual WLAN and then that way
 

179
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,860
use that virtual WLAN and then that way
you're not using your you know your two

you're not using your you know your two
 

181
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,209
you're not using your you know your two
gigahertz because you might want to use

gigahertz because you might want to use
 

183
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:46,459
gigahertz because you might want to use
that for something for real right but

that for something for real right but
 

185
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,040
that for something for real right but
you could set up a virtual wireless LAN

you could set up a virtual wireless LAN
 

187
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,559
you could set up a virtual wireless LAN
and it could be named it with a silly

to wireless and click wireless and you

238
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:10,589
to wireless and click wireless and you
 

239
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,390
to wireless and click wireless and you
see okay so find your 2.4 gigahertz - so

240
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
see okay so find your 2.4 gigahertz - so
 

241
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,950
see okay so find your 2.4 gigahertz - so
there it is 2 gigahertz it's the one in

242
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:15,960
there it is 2 gigahertz it's the one in
 

243
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,579
there it is 2 gigahertz it's the one in
the middle it is w LAN one on my

244
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:19,589
the middle it is w LAN one on my
 

245
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,129
the middle it is w LAN one on my
mikrotik it may be different on yours

246
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:22,139
mikrotik it may be different on yours
 

247
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,379
mikrotik it may be different on yours
but find out which one it is you need to

248
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:24,389
but find out which one it is you need to
 

249
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,869
but find out which one it is you need to
know the name of that so in my case it's

250
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:26,879
know the name of that so in my case it's
 

251
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,589
know the name of that so in my case it's
all lowercase W LAN 1 now what I want to

252
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:30,599
all lowercase W LAN 1 now what I want to
 

253
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,829
all lowercase W LAN 1 now what I want to
do is go into system and scheduler and

254
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:35,839
do is go into system and scheduler and
 

255
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,360
do is go into system and scheduler and
in the course of this series I have

256
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,370
in the course of this series I have
 

257
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,100
in the course of this series I have
mentioned that the mikrotik is

258
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,110
mentioned that the mikrotik is
 

259
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,600
mentioned that the mikrotik is
programmable so that's essentially what

260
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,610
programmable so that's essentially what
 

261
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,030
programmable so that's essentially what
we're gonna do we're gonna program it

262
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,040
we're gonna do we're gonna program it
 

263
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,200
we're gonna do we're gonna program it
using the scheduler because you

264
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,210
using the scheduler because you
 

265
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,490
using the scheduler because you
mentioned that you want this to happen

266
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:46,500
mentioned that you want this to happen
 

267
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,620
mentioned that you want this to happen
you said at random times it's not

268
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:48,630
you said at random times it's not
 

269
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,810
you said at random times it's not
actually going to be random in our case

270
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:50,820
actually going to be random in our case
 

271
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,450
actually going to be random in our case
we'll do it on a schedule and it will

272
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,460
we'll do it on a schedule and it will
 

273
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,510
we'll do it on a schedule and it will
recur so it will turn on and then off

274
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:56,520
recur so it will turn on and then off
 

275
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,140
recur so it will turn on and then off
and on and off so add new and we're

276
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,150
and on and off so add new and we're
 

277
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,720
and on and off so add new and we're
gonna call this one name it

278
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:05,730
gonna call this one name it
 

279
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:11,420
gonna call this one name it
turn off 2.4 gigahertz and my start date

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:16,680
today just so that you see it happening
 

287
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,480
today just so that you see it happening
right away and I'm gonna set it to 12

288
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,490
right away and I'm gonna set it to 12
 

289
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,120
right away and I'm gonna set it to 12
o'clock on the button with an interval

290

o'clock on the button with an interval
now you would probably if you want it to

292
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:25,620
now you would probably if you want it to
 

293
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,550
now you would probably if you want it to
be every minute right you could do

294
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
be every minute right you could do
 

295
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,290
be every minute right you could do
something like that if you want it to be

296
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,300
something like that if you want it to be
 

297
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,540
something like that if you want it to be
every 10 minutes something like that for

298
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:32,550
every 10 minutes something like that for
 

299
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,860
every 10 minutes something like that for
the case of the for the sake of the

300

the case of the for the sake of the
 

301
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,330
the case of the for the sake of the
demonstration I'm gonna do every 10

302
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,340
demonstration I'm gonna do every 10
 

303
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,610
demonstration I'm gonna do every 10
seconds keeping in mind we're going to

304
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:37,620
seconds keeping in mind we're going to
 

305
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,370
seconds keeping in mind we're going to
be turning it on and off on and off so

306
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,380
be turning it on and off on and off so
 

307
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,840
be turning it on and off on and off so
it's actually gonna be every 5 seconds

308
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:41,850
it's actually gonna be every 5 seconds
 

309
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,790
it's actually gonna be every 5 seconds
I'm going to set the intervals as such

310
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm going to set the intervals as such
 

311
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm going to set the intervals as such
so but that will just make it so that we

312
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,410
so but that will just make it so that we
 

313
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,250
so but that will just make it so that we
can see it right away so the on event is

314
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:49,260
can see it right away so the on event is
 

315
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,230
can see it right away so the on event is
where we're actually going to program it

316
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
where we're actually going to program it
 

317
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,040
where we're actually going to program it
so we're gonna say interphase wireless

318
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,050
so we're gonna say interphase wireless
 

319
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,360
so we're gonna say interphase wireless
disabled what was the name of it W LAN 1

320
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,370
disabled what was the name of it W LAN 1
 

321
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,220
disabled what was the name of it W LAN 1
ok as soon as I hit OK I'm gonna lose my

322
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,230
ok as soon as I hit OK I'm gonna lose my
 

323
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,730
ok as soon as I hit OK I'm gonna lose my
W LAN 1 so if I head over to cos C it's

324
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:04,740
W LAN 1 so if I head over to cos C it's
 

325
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,110
W LAN 1 so if I head over to cos C it's
it's already scheduled it and it's gonna

326
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,120
it's already scheduled it and it's gonna
 

327
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,670
it's already scheduled it and it's gonna
say run count and that's going to start

328
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
say run count and that's going to start
 

329
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,980
say run count and that's going to start
increasing see that one so now my

330
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:09,990
increasing see that one so now my
 

331
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,830
increasing see that one so now my
Wireless is off so if I go to wireless

332
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:12,840
Wireless is off so if I go to wireless
 

333
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,190
Wireless is off so if I go to wireless
now you can see W LAN 1 has been

334
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,200
now you can see W LAN 1 has been
 

335
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,380
now you can see W LAN 1 has been
disabled so go back to your scheduler

336
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,390
disabled so go back to your scheduler
 

337
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,360
disabled so go back to your scheduler
because we need to now the van is driven

338
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,370
because we need to now the van is driven
 

339
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,060
because we need to now the van is driven
away presumably right so we want to make

340
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,070
away presumably right so we want to make
 

341
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,170
away presumably right so we want to make
it so the van has returned let's put

342
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,180
it so the van has returned let's put
 

343
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,990
it so the van has returned let's put
this into a scenario that maybe makes a

344
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
this into a scenario that maybe makes a
 

345
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,210
this into a scenario that maybe makes a
little more sense because I understand

346
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,220
little more sense because I understand
 

347
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,250
little more sense because I understand
rockaway CCW is being a little bit silly

348
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,260
rockaway CCW is being a little bit silly
 

349
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,790
rockaway CCW is being a little bit silly
here but I'm still happy to oblige let's

350
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,800
here but I'm still happy to oblige let's
 

351
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,620
here but I'm still happy to oblige let's
think about a parent who wants to be

352
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:39,630
think about a parent who wants to be
 

353
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,460
think about a parent who wants to be
able to turn so set your guest Wi-Fi use

354
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,470
able to turn so set your guest Wi-Fi use
 

355
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,230
able to turn so set your guest Wi-Fi use
that tutorial to create a Wi-Fi for your

356
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
that tutorial to create a Wi-Fi for your
 

357
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,890
that tutorial to create a Wi-Fi for your
kids to use then have it turn it off

358
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:50,900
kids to use then have it turn it off
 

359
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,260
kids to use then have it turn it off
automatically at curfew

360
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,270
automatically at curfew
 

361
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,900
automatically at curfew
okay so let's use that as the there's a

362
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:56,910
okay so let's use that as the there's a
 

363
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,090
okay so let's use that as the there's a
really good scenario I like that so

364
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,100
really good scenario I like that so
 

365
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,820
really good scenario I like that so
there you go okay so here we are now

366
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:01,830
there you go okay so here we are now
 

367
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,190
there you go okay so here we are now
creating remember where I am here I'm

368
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,200
creating remember where I am here I'm
 

369
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,170
creating remember where I am here I'm
under system scheduler and I'm creating

370
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,180
under system scheduler and I'm creating
 

371
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,050
under system scheduler and I'm creating
a new one so add new I don't have

372
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,060
a new one so add new I don't have
 

373
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,600
a new one so add new I don't have
anything to turn it back on so re-enable

374
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,610
anything to turn it back on so re-enable
 

375
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,870
anything to turn it back on so re-enable
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi and this could be

376
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:17,880
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi and this could be
 

377
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,690
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi and this could be
any interface right it doesn't have to

378
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:20,700
any interface right it doesn't have to
 

379
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,660
any interface right it doesn't have to
be Wi-Fi in our case where that's the

380
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:23,670
be Wi-Fi in our case where that's the
 

381
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,160
be Wi-Fi in our case where that's the
demonstration but so interface Wireless

382
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,170
demonstration but so interface Wireless
 

383
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,670
demonstration but so interface Wireless
enable w lan 1 is what that one is

384
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
enable w lan 1 is what that one is
 

385
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,230
enable w lan 1 is what that one is
called so now it's to look at the

386
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,240
called so now it's to look at the
 

387
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,790
called so now it's to look at the
schedule so remember i set the other one

388
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
schedule so remember i set the other one
 

389
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,490
schedule so remember i set the other one
to 12 o clock right on the button so I'm

390
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:40,500
to 12 o clock right on the button so I'm
 

391
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,020
to 12 o clock right on the button so I'm
setting this the same just to make it

392
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,030
setting this the same just to make it
 

393
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,900
setting this the same just to make it
easy for you to see on the third which

394
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:44,910
easy for you to see on the third which
 

395
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,600
easy for you to see on the third which
is when I'm filming this live and we're

396
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:47,610
is when I'm filming this live and we're
 

397
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,850
is when I'm filming this live and we're
setting this to 10 seconds so right now

398
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:49,860
setting this to 10 seconds so right now
 

399
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,490
setting this to 10 seconds so right now
it's it's set to happen at exactly the

400
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:52,500
it's it's set to happen at exactly the
 

401
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,070
it's it's set to happen at exactly the
same time as our other schedule which

402
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,080
same time as our other schedule which
 

403
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,450
same time as our other schedule which
turns it off so basically these are

404
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:56,460
turns it off so basically these are
 

405
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,980
turns it off so basically these are
going to cancel each other out so what

406
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:57,990
going to cancel each other out so what
 

407
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,120
going to cancel each other out so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to offset

408
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,130
I'm going to do is I'm going to offset
 

409
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,060
I'm going to do is I'm going to offset
this 1 by 5 seconds so every 5 seconds

410
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,070
this 1 by 5 seconds so every 5 seconds
 

411
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,100
this 1 by 5 seconds so every 5 seconds
we're gonna have the Wi-Fi turn off and

412
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,110
we're gonna have the Wi-Fi turn off and
 

413
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,150
we're gonna have the Wi-Fi turn off and
then five seconds later it's going to

414
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,160
then five seconds later it's going to
 

415
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,700
then five seconds later it's going to
turn back on even though each task is

416
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:07,710
turn back on even though each task is
 

417
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,940
turn back on even though each task is
happening every 10 seconds so if all

418
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:10,950
happening every 10 seconds so if all
 

419
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,220
happening every 10 seconds so if all
goes well I'm gonna hit ok and we should

420
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,230
goes well I'm gonna hit ok and we should
 

421
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,340
goes well I'm gonna hit ok and we should
see that that one is going to run and

422
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,350
see that that one is going to run and
 

423
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,950
see that that one is going to run and
see the schedule there they're off by 5

424
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:18,960
see the schedule there they're off by 5
 

425
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,410
see the schedule there they're off by 5
seconds re-enable has run ok let's jump

426
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:24,420
seconds re-enable has run ok let's jump
 

427
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,490
seconds re-enable has run ok let's jump
back over to wireless and watch my W

428
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:28,500
back over to wireless and watch my W
 

429
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,440
back over to wireless and watch my W
land just watch it I'm not gonna touch a

430
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,450
land just watch it I'm not gonna touch a
 

431
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,250
land just watch it I'm not gonna touch a
thing here my hands are off it's on

432
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,260
thing here my hands are off it's on
 

433
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:40,070
thing here my hands are off it's on
watch WN 1 and it's off that is going to

434
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,080
watch WN 1 and it's off that is going to
 

435
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,010
watch WN 1 and it's off that is going to
continue happening indefinitely it's

436
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,020
continue happening indefinitely it's
 

437
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,570
continue happening indefinitely it's
going to keep going on and off and on

438
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:44,580
going to keep going on and off and on
 

439
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,850
going to keep going on and off and on
and off now use the scenario that I gave

440
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:46,860
and off now use the scenario that I gave
 

441
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,370
and off now use the scenario that I gave
you for those of you who are not trying

442
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:49,380
you for those of you who are not trying
 

443
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,210
you for those of you who are not trying
to simulate a van and maybe use this to

444
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:53,220
to simulate a van and maybe use this to
 

445
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,520
to simulate a van and maybe use this to
schedule that the internet turns off for

446
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:55,530
schedule that the internet turns off for
 

447
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,170
schedule that the internet turns off for
the particular Wi-Fi that your kids are

448
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,180
the particular Wi-Fi that your kids are
 

449
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,720
the particular Wi-Fi that your kids are
using at 9 o'clock p.m. and it turns

450
00:10:59,720 --> 00:10:59,730
using at 9 o'clock p.m. and it turns
 

451
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,490
using at 9 o'clock p.m. and it turns
back on at 7 o'clock in the morning or

452
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:01,500
back on at 7 o'clock in the morning or
 

453
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,110
back on at 7 o'clock in the morning or
maybe you even though that you're having

454
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
maybe you even though that you're having
 

455
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,910
maybe you even though that you're having
a home school right now right the

456
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:04,920
a home school right now right the
 

457
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,900
a home school right now right the
scheduler can be

458
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:05,910
scheduler can be
 

459
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,270
scheduler can be
to only saturdays and it can turn on at

460
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,280
to only saturdays and it can turn on at
