possible the emmc storage is disabled

possible the emmc storage is disabled
 

89
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,050
possible the emmc storage is disabled
with a hardware switch and you may need

90
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,060
with a hardware switch and you may need
 

91
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,100
with a hardware switch and you may need
to flip the emmc disabled switch

unfortunately it seems that while some

99
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,410
that switch enabled out of the factory
which means there emmc storage is

100
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:08,420
which means there emmc storage is
 

101
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,990
which means there emmc storage is
physically disabled and when I say emmc

storage medium here emmc
and that's just a chip that you can you

160
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,330
and that's just a chip that you can you
 

161
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,480
and that's just a chip that you can you
can remove and replace if you want but

162
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,490
can remove and replace if you want but
 

163
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,310
can remove and replace if you want but
that's included with your pine Book Pro

164
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:30,320
that's included with your pine Book Pro
 

165
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,430
that's included with your pine Book Pro
however as we can see here the switch is

166
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
however as we can see here the switch is
 

167
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,430
however as we can see here the switch is
set toward the front this is the switch

168
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,440
set toward the front this is the switch
 

169
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,930
set toward the front this is the switch
that enables and disables the emmc so

170
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:40,940
that enables and disables the emmc so
 

171
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,700
that enables and disables the emmc so
what I need to do is take that switch

172
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:42,710
what I need to do is take that switch
 

173
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,240
what I need to do is take that switch
and very carefully flip it toward the

174
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,250
and very carefully flip it toward the
 

175
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,940
and very carefully flip it toward the
hinge mechanism alright so I've just

176
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:48,950
hinge mechanism alright so I've just
 

177
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,000
hinge mechanism alright so I've just
flipped that over and now it's as simple

178
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,010
flipped that over and now it's as simple
 

179
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,890
flipped that over and now it's as simple
as that let's put this case back on

180
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:53,900
as that let's put this case back on
 

181
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,160
as that let's put this case back on
being mindful of the sharp edges always

182
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,170
being mindful of the sharp edges always
 

183
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,350
being mindful of the sharp edges always
put the case back on before you flip it

184
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
put the case back on before you flip it
 

185
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,180
put the case back on before you flip it
over otherwise you may lose some of the

186
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,190
over otherwise you may lose some of the
 

187
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,850
over otherwise you may lose some of the
internal plastic components that kind of

188
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:03,860
internal plastic components that kind of
 

189
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,080
internal plastic components that kind of
elevate things flip that over and let's

190
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,090
elevate things flip that over and let's
 

191
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,780
elevate things flip that over and let's
give it a test so I'm going to carefully

192
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:10,790
give it a test so I'm going to carefully
 

193
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,290
give it a test so I'm going to carefully
open up my pine Book Pro and let's see

194
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:14,300
open up my pine Book Pro and let's see
 

195
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,710
open up my pine Book Pro and let's see
if she boots I've got a power light now

196
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
if she boots I've got a power light now
 

197
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,820
if she boots I've got a power light now
which is promising it's turned green and
