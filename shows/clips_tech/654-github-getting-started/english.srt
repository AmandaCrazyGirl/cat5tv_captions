101
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,880
manage our projects so that you can go
back in time basically with code

102
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:12,890
back in time basically with code
 

103
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,040

essentially what it does for me is it

126
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:43,340
essentially what it does for me is it
 

127
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,910
essentially what it does for me is it
allows me to share my code online in

128
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
allows me to share my code online in
 

129
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,470
allows me to share my code online in
such a way that other people can use it

130
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,480
such a way that other people can use it
 

131
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,449
such a way that other people can use it
open source they can compile it or use

132
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:49,459
open source they can compile it or use
 

133
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,620
open source they can compile it or use
it or run it on their own computers and

134
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:52,630
it or run it on their own computers and
 

135
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,449
it or run it on their own computers and
then if they decide oh well I'd rather

136
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:55,459
then if they decide oh well I'd rather
 

137
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,520
then if they decide oh well I'd rather
it work this way or maybe here's a bug

138
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,530
it work this way or maybe here's a bug
 

139
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,500
it work this way or maybe here's a bug
and I can fix that they can do what's

140
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,510
and I can fix that they can do what's
 

141
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,080
and I can fix that they can do what's
called a pull request so basically they

142
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,090
called a pull request so basically they
 

143
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,380
called a pull request so basically they
clone my github repository my software

144
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,390
clone my github repository my software
 

145
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,229
clone my github repository my software
code they fix it on their computer and

146
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
code they fix it on their computer and
 

147
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
code they fix it on their computer and
then they do a pull request which pushes

148
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:10,730
then they do a pull request which pushes
 

149
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,240
then they do a pull request which pushes
it back while they push it back to their

150
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,250
it back while they push it back to their
 

151
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,090
it back while they push it back to their
fork and then it creates a pull request

152
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,100
fork and then it creates a pull request
 

153
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,509
fork and then it creates a pull request
for me so that I see that hey Joe will

154
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
for me so that I see that hey Joe will
 

155
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,699
for me so that I see that hey Joe will
blow over their fix this bug with my

156
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:21,709
blow over their fix this bug with my
 

157
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,920
blow over their fix this bug with my
software I can click a button and it

158
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:23,930
software I can click a button and it
 

159
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,710
software I can click a button and it

565
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,200
you can do this from anywhere so now if
I look at my file locally on my computer

566
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,210
I look at my file locally on my computer
 

567
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,500
I look at my file locally on my computer
in the repository there we go it still

go get pull again I'm doing this all
 

573
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,990
go get pull again I'm doing this all
within the my underscore test folder so

574
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
within the my underscore test folder so
 

575
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,690
within the my underscore test folder so
git pull is going to then look for any

576
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:58,700
git pull is going to then look for any
 

577

and pull them down to my computer so
 

581
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,020
and pull them down to my computer so
it's always synchronizing those changes

625
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,340
doesn't have to be mine it can be
someone else's github repository as long

626
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:12,350
someone else's github repository as long
 

627
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,680
someone else's github repository as long
as it's public but then I can make

628
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:14,690
as it's public but then I can make
 

629

as it's public but then I can make
changes to it on my local machine and

630
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:16,640
changes to it on my local machine and
 

631

then I can do a push now you have to own
the repository in order to do a push so

634
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,490
the repository in order to do a push so
 

635

the way to make changes to someone
 

637
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,970
the way to make changes to someone
else's repository is to fork it so when

638
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:27,980
else's repository is to fork it so when
 

639
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,560
else's repository is to fork it so when
you go to the repository you click on

640
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:29,570
you go to the repository you click on
 

641
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,200
you go to the repository you click on
the button called fork and it basically

642
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,210
the button called fork and it basically
 

643
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,030

makes a copy of it in your own account
that you can make changes to and then

646
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:35,930
that you can make changes to and then
 

647
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,540
that you can make changes to and then
that's where you can do pull requests

648
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:37,550
that's where you can do pull requests
 

649
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,310
that's where you can do pull requests
but those are the basics to get you
