what was the first computer that you

226
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,180
what was the first computer that you
 

227
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,260
what was the first computer that you
used the what I would attribute what I

228
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,270
used the what I would attribute what I
 

229
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,999
used the what I would attribute what I
would say is the first computer that I

230
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:28,009
would say is the first computer that I
 

231
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,860
would say is the first computer that I
ever sat down and coded on would have

232
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:29,870
ever sat down and coded on would have
 

233
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,040
ever sat down and coded on would have
been the vic-20 and I used that thing

237
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,770
like crazy like I got to the point where
I was writing code at you know five six

238
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:38,780
I was writing code at you know five six
 

239
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,490
I was writing code at you know five six
years old which incidentally you know I

247
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,560
have done the same and you know my nine
year old now our youngest is is coding

248
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,570
year old now our youngest is is coding
 

249
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,540
year old now our youngest is is coding
in roblox and it's and it's so that

250
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:55,550
in roblox and it's and it's so that
 

251
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,040
in roblox and it's and it's so that
throws me back to those days and and I

252
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,050
throws me back to those days and and I
 

253
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,170
throws me back to those days and and I
really like that time where computers we

254
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:02,180
really like that time where computers we
 

255
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,850
really like that time where computers we
understood how they worked we understood

256
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:03,860
understood how they worked we understood
 

257
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,010
understood how they worked we understood
the inner workings of them so taking

258
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,020
the inner workings of them so taking
 

259
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,320

290
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:51,620
find it I can't imagine he didn't but he
 

291
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,830
find it I can't imagine he didn't but he
never mentioned it so I think he

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
never mentioned it so I think he
 

293
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,050
never mentioned it so I think he
probably must have known but my naive

doesn't know and it's like this massive
computer now how long is it before you

300
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:05,900
computer now how long is it before you
 

301
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,459
computer now how long is it before you
make the switch to Linux well then those

302
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:09,469
make the switch to Linux well then those
 

303
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,620
make the switch to Linux well then those
windows was a complete switch yeah

Lubuntu Matea is not brilliant it really

428
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,410
Lubuntu Matea is not brilliant it really
 

429
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,290
Lubuntu Matea is not brilliant it really
is but this is just where I've landed

430
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:20,300
is but this is just where I've landed
 

431
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,300
is but this is just where I've landed
yeah when you know how things work under

432
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,310
yeah when you know how things work under
 

433
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,710
yeah when you know how things work under
the hood a lot of stuff is very similar

434
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
the hood a lot of stuff is very similar
 

435
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,750
the hood a lot of stuff is very similar
so it's really just finding a stable

436
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:26,760
so it's really just finding a stable
 

437
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,310
so it's really just finding a stable
distro that works out of the box that

438
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
distro that works out of the box that
 

439
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,930
distro that works out of the box that
doesn't waste a lot of your time setting

doesn't waste a lot of your time setting
 

441
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,329
doesn't waste a lot of your time setting
it up because I use Linux Mint at at

442
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:35,339
it up because I use Linux Mint at at

reinstall in and be up and running in an
 

447
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:43,610
reinstall in and be up and running in an
hour and you know back in business kind

448
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:43,620
hour and you know back in business kind
 

449
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,259
hour and you know back in business kind
of things so it's worked not that I

450
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:45,269
of things so it's worked not that I
 

451
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,490
of things so it's worked not that I
couldn't do that with we're going to

452
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:46,500
couldn't do that with we're going to
 

453
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,190
couldn't do that with we're going to
Matei it's just where you are it's just

454
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
Matei it's just where you are it's just
 

455
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,620
Matei it's just where you are it's just
where I'm at yeah and I think that makes

456
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:51,630
where I'm at yeah and I think that makes
 

457
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,569
where I'm at yeah and I think that makes
it really confusing too for for new

458
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:53,579
it really confusing too for for new
 

459
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,360
it really confusing too for for new
Linux users because well which which

why Ubuntu might a versus Linux Mint

464
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,170
why Ubuntu might a versus Linux Mint
 

465
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,790
why Ubuntu might a versus Linux Mint
with matei the it's really they're all

466
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
with matei the it's really they're all
 

467
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,030
with matei the it's really they're all
very very similar so it's community it's

468
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,040
very very similar so it's community it's
 

469
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,550
very very similar so it's community it's
