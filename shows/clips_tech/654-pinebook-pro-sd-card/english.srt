while I showed on my pine Book Pro that

38
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:49,829
while I showed on my pine Book Pro that
 

39
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,229
while I showed on my pine Book Pro that
a quick tap on the pine logo and f/11

40
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
a quick tap on the pine logo and f/11
 

41
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,420
a quick tap on the pine logo and f/11
would enable and disable Wi-Fi and that

42
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,430
would enable and disable Wi-Fi and that
 

43
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,340
would enable and disable Wi-Fi and that
seemed to work fine for for our

44

seemed to work fine for for our
 

45
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,040

demonstration last week he's mentioning

46
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,050
demonstration last week he's mentioning
 

47
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,080

that on his notebook on his pine Book

48
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,090
that on his notebook on his pine Book
 

49
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,539

Pro he had to actually hold in that key
 

51
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,820
Pro he had to actually hold in that key
sequence for three seconds so if you're

52
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,830
sequence for three seconds so if you're
 

53
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,740
sequence for three seconds so if you're
finding that it's not having an impact

54
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:09,750
finding that it's not having an impact
 

55
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,990
finding that it's not having an impact
perhaps that's the difference follow the

56
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
perhaps that's the difference follow the
 

57
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
perhaps that's the difference follow the
same tutorial from last week on how to

same tutorial from last week on how to

Book Pro but try holding it in for three

62
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:17,909
Book Pro but try holding it in for three
 

63
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,480
Book Pro but try holding it in for three
seconds if my demonstration of really

64
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,490
seconds if my demonstration of really
 

65
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,880
seconds if my demonstration of really
quickly tapping didn't do it for you so

66
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,890
quickly tapping didn't do it for you so
 

67
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,950
quickly tapping didn't do it for you so
that's good to know as well

68
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
that's good to know as well
 

69
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,789
that's good to know as well
the final thing the bp9 mentions is that

70
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:27,799
the final thing the bp9 mentions is that
 

71
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,719
the final thing the bp9 mentions is that
his keyboard came preset up with the UK

72
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:32,729
his keyboard came preset up with the UK
 

73
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,490
his keyboard came preset up with the UK
keyboard layout well that could be

74
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
keyboard layout well that could be
 

75
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,230
keyboard layout well that could be
frustrating because your keys are not

76
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
frustrating because your keys are not
 

77
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,429
frustrating because your keys are not
gonna be in the right spot

78
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
gonna be in the right spot
 

79
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,760
gonna be in the right spot
so basically ISO layout versus ANSI and

80
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:40,770
so basically ISO layout versus ANSI and
 

81
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,560
so basically ISO layout versus ANSI and
so you'd have trouble entering your

82
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,570
so you'd have trouble entering your
 

83
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,690
so you'd have trouble entering your
password and things like that

84
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:43,700
password and things like that
 

85
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,429
password and things like that
interestingly enough when I booted up

86
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:46,439
interestingly enough when I booted up
 

87
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,649
interestingly enough when I booted up
and fired up Manjaro for the first time

88
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:48,659
and fired up Manjaro for the first time
 

89
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,340
and fired up Manjaro for the first time
it asked me whether I wanted ISO or ANSI

90
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,350
it asked me whether I wanted ISO or ANSI
 

91
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,469
it asked me whether I wanted ISO or ANSI
so I went through that process of

92
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
so I went through that process of
 

93
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,929
so I went through that process of
telling it what keyboard layout I had

94
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:56,939
telling it what keyboard layout I had
 

95
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,450
telling it what keyboard layout I had
and it worked just fine for me but in

96
00:01:59,450 --> 00:01:59,460
and it worked just fine for me but in
 

97
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,480
and it worked just fine for me but in
vp9 s case that wasn't the case and he

98
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,490
vp9 s case that wasn't the case and he
 

99
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,310
vp9 s case that wasn't the case and he
was very quickly able to go in and just

100
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
was very quickly able to go in and just
 

101
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,280
was very quickly able to go in and just
change the keyboard settings within the

102
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,290
change the keyboard settings within the
 

103
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,249
change the keyboard settings within the
menu system found his way there says it

104
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:10,259
menu system found his way there says it
 

105
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,559
menu system found his way there says it
wasn't a big deal it was a simple fix

106
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:12,569
wasn't a big deal it was a simple fix
 

107
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,120
wasn't a big deal it was a simple fix
that I didn't even need the

108
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,130
that I didn't even need the
 

109
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,390
that I didn't even need the

multiple distros you got to kind of pop
you push in if you have one in there and

160
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,330
you push in if you have one in there and
 

161
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,960
you push in if you have one in there and
then it pops out so that's my SD card

162
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:26,970
then it pops out so that's my SD card
 

163
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,510
then it pops out so that's my SD card
right there I think I just ejected my OS

164
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:29,520
right there I think I just ejected my OS
 

165
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,200
right there I think I just ejected my OS
while it's on oh don't do that

166
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,210
while it's on oh don't do that
 

167
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,440
while it's on oh don't do that
that's like pulling your hard drive but

168
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,450
that's like pulling your hard drive but
 

169
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,050
that's like pulling your hard drive but
the built-in emmc can be a little bit

170
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,060
the built-in emmc can be a little bit
 

171
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,440
the built-in emmc can be a little bit
more challenging to to set up but think

172
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,450
more challenging to to set up but think
 

173
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,630
more challenging to to set up but think
about this one of the things and I'll

174
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
about this one of the things and I'll
 

175
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,850
about this one of the things and I'll
touch on that I'll explain that but one

176
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:46,860
touch on that I'll explain that but one
 

177
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,590
touch on that I'll explain that but one
of the things I like about SD cards and

178
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:48,600
of the things I like about SD cards and
 

179
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,020
of the things I like about SD cards and
the ability to boot from an SD card yeah

180
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,030
the ability to boot from an SD card yeah
 

181
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,270
the ability to boot from an SD card yeah
sure enough I just crashed my system I'm

182
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
sure enough I just crashed my system I'm
 

183
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,720
sure enough I just crashed my system I'm
gonna reboot the nice thing about being

184
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:56,730
gonna reboot the nice thing about being
 

185
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,850
gonna reboot the nice thing about being
able to boot from an SD card is let's

186
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:58,860
able to boot from an SD card is let's
 

187
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,580
able to boot from an SD card is let's
say you've got a household where

188
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:01,590
say you've got a household where
 

189
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,280
say you've got a household where
everybody shares the same devices so you

190
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,290
everybody shares the same devices so you
 

191
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,440
everybody shares the same devices so you
could give each family member for

192
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,450
could give each family member for
 

193
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,270
could give each family member for
example or maybe you're an education

194
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,280
example or maybe you're an education
 

195
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,380
example or maybe you're an education
facility and you want to give each

196
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,390
facility and you want to give each
 

197
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,070
facility and you want to give each
student or each teacher their own SD

198
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,080
student or each teacher their own SD
 

199
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,960
student or each teacher their own SD
card so you set up the operating system

200
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:14,970
card so you set up the operating system
 

201
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,199
card so you set up the operating system
on that SD card and everyone who goes to

202
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,209
on that SD card and everyone who goes to
 

203
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,219
on that SD card and everyone who goes to
use it with the power off boots from

204
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:22,229
use it with the power off boots from
 

205
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,170
use it with the power off boots from
their SD card and all their applications

206
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,180
their SD card and all their applications
 

207
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,220
their SD card and all their applications
everything else is set up on a per

208
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,230
everything else is set up on a per
 

209
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,050
everything else is set up on a per
user basis and nobody affects any other

210
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,060
user basis and nobody affects any other
 

211
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,000
user basis and nobody affects any other
user because the SD card is in fact

212
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,010
user because the SD card is in fact
 

213
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,280
user because the SD card is in fact
their booting harddrive now I just

214
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,290
their booting harddrive now I just
 

215
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,650
their booting harddrive now I just
proved that doing what I just did while

216
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:35,660
proved that doing what I just did while
 

217
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,820
proved that doing what I just did while
stupid did not destroy my pint book Pro

218
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:39,830
stupid did not destroy my pint book Pro
 

219
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,070
stupid did not destroy my pint book Pro
operating system on my SD card so that's

220
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
operating system on my SD card so that's
 

221
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,660
operating system on my SD card so that's
a good thing so that's kind of cool

222
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:43,670
a good thing so that's kind of cool
 

223
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,550
a good thing so that's kind of cool
because with your own SD card you can

224
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:45,560
because with your own SD card you can
 

225
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,900
because with your own SD card you can
just boot it up and have your own

226
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:46,910
just boot it up and have your own
 

227
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,790
just boot it up and have your own
settings so I like that

228
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
settings so I like that
 

229
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,620
settings so I like that
if you've settled on the distro that

230
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:50,630
if you've settled on the distro that
 

231
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,800
if you've settled on the distro that
you'd prefer it may be time to install

232
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:53,810
you'd prefer it may be time to install
 

233
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,470
you'd prefer it may be time to install
it on an emmc but it can be more

234
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:56,480
it on an emmc but it can be more
 

235
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,300
it on an emmc but it can be more
involved as I mentioned because it

236
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,310
involved as I mentioned because it
 

237
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,520
involved as I mentioned because it
requires sometimes opening the pine book

238
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,530
requires sometimes opening the pine book
 

239
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,930
requires sometimes opening the pine book
pro and you've got to use a special

240
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:01,940
pro and you've got to use a special
 

241
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,780
pro and you've got to use a special
adapter to flash it but the process

242
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:04,790
adapter to flash it but the process
 

243
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,050
adapter to flash it but the process
itself is the same even in that case so

244
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,060
itself is the same even in that case so
 

245
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,670
itself is the same even in that case so
if you have the adapter you're gonna

246
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
if you have the adapter you're gonna
 

247
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,290
if you have the adapter you're gonna
burn to an emmc I used the term burn

248
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:13,300
burn to an emmc I used the term burn
 

249
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,910
burn to an emmc I used the term burn
using an adapter plugged into the USB

250
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:15,920
using an adapter plugged into the USB
 

251
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,070
using an adapter plugged into the USB
port or something like that

252
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
port or something like that
 

253
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,720
port or something like that
and it's going to be the same process

254
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:19,730
and it's going to be the same process
 

255
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,940
and it's going to be the same process
you're gonna use the same software you

256
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:21,950
you're gonna use the same software you
 

257
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,260
you're gonna use the same software you
may have to use a different image

258
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,270
may have to use a different image
 

259
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,450
may have to use a different image
depending on which distro you're looking

260
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:25,460
depending on which distro you're looking
 

261
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,080
depending on which distro you're looking
at but speaking of there are some

262
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,090
at but speaking of there are some
 

263
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,140
at but speaking of there are some
distros such as Manjaro that actually

264
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,150
distros such as Manjaro that actually
 

265
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,690
distros such as Manjaro that actually
offer an installer so if you burn it to

266
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:34,700
offer an installer so if you burn it to
 

267
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,720
offer an installer so if you burn it to
an SD card then you boot the pint book

268
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:37,730
an SD card then you boot the pint book
 

269
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,150
an SD card then you boot the pint book
pro you can then install it to the emmc

270
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
pro you can then install it to the emmc
 

271
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,860
pro you can then install it to the emmc
so you don't have to open up the pine

272
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:41,870
so you don't have to open up the pine
 

273
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,930
so you don't have to open up the pine
book Pro you don't have to buy an

274
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:43,940
book Pro you don't have to buy an
 

275
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,660
book Pro you don't have to buy an
adapter to be able to flash any MMC card

276
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:46,670
adapter to be able to flash any MMC card
 

277
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,180
adapter to be able to flash any MMC card
so that's pretty brilliant you've got to

278
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,190
so that's pretty brilliant you've got to
 

279
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,610
so that's pretty brilliant you've got to
look through the the wiki or the website

280
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:51,620
look through the the wiki or the website
 

281
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,250
look through the the wiki or the website
of the individual distro that you're

282
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,260
of the individual distro that you're
 

283
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,440
of the individual distro that you're
looking at so we're gonna head on over

284
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,450
looking at so we're gonna head on over
 

285
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,540
looking at so we're gonna head on over
to pine 64 dot org and choose the distro

286
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:01,550
to pine 64 dot org and choose the distro
 

287
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,500
to pine 64 dot org and choose the distro
that that we're going to download so you

288
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:05,510
that that we're going to download so you
 

289
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,680
that that we're going to download so you
just go pine 64 dot org click on the

290
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:08,690
just go pine 64 dot org click on the
 

291
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,380
just go pine 64 dot org click on the
wiki and go to pine book pro software

292
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:13,390
wiki and go to pine book pro software
 

293
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,720
wiki and go to pine book pro software
now I'm gonna go with Manjaro because we

294
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:16,730
now I'm gonna go with Manjaro because we
 

295
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,040
now I'm gonna go with Manjaro because we
know that it's tried-and-true it's the

296
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,050
know that it's tried-and-true it's the
 

297
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,740
know that it's tried-and-true it's the
one that's coming on it and I've

298
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:20,750
one that's coming on it and I've
 

299
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,200
one that's coming on it and I've
actually downloaded Debian on my SD card

300
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,210
actually downloaded Debian on my SD card
 

301
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,720
actually downloaded Debian on my SD card
so I'm booting from an SD card normally

302
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:25,730
so I'm booting from an SD card normally
 

303
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,700
so I'm booting from an SD card normally
so this is Debian running off of the SD

304
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:30,710
so this is Debian running off of the SD
 

305
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,350
so this is Debian running off of the SD
card we're going to change that in a

306
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:32,360
card we're going to change that in a
 

307
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,500
card we're going to change that in a
couple of moments so next step is we

308
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,510
couple of moments so next step is we
 

309
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,510
couple of moments so next step is we
need to get a tool to do the

310
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,520
need to get a tool to do the
 

311
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,639
need to get a tool to do the
we're gonna use a tool called B'Elanna
