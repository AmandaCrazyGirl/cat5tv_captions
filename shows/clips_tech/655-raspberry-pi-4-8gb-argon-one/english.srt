00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:18,260
so kidding
 

155
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,190
so kidding
alright there's a protective film on the

156
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,200
alright there's a protective film on the
 

157
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,970
alright there's a protective film on the
plastic bits

158
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:24,980

 

159
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,090

and this my friends that is the argon

160
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,100
and this my friends that is the argon
 

161
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,600
and this my friends that is the argon
one Raspberry Pi model for sorry

162
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:31,610
one Raspberry Pi model for sorry
 

163
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,590
one Raspberry Pi model for sorry
Raspberry Pi for open it up and see

164
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
Raspberry Pi for open it up and see
 

165
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,190
Raspberry Pi for open it up and see
what's inside okay we've got this

166
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,200
what's inside okay we've got this
 

167
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:50,620
what's inside okay we've got this
expansion board there it is this is cool

168
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:50,630
expansion board there it is this is cool
 

169
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,840
expansion board there it is this is cool
so one of the things with a Raspberry Pi

170
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:52,850
so one of the things with a Raspberry Pi
 

171
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,150
so one of the things with a Raspberry Pi
or any single board computer for the

172
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,160
or any single board computer for the
 

173
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,730
or any single board computer for the
most part is that you've got these

174
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:57,740
most part is that you've got these
 

175
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,310
most part is that you've got these
connectors all around the board so it's

176
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
connectors all around the board so it's
 

177
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,050
connectors all around the board so it's
really hard to make it look nice on a

178
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,060
really hard to make it look nice on a
 

179
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,680
really hard to make it look nice on a
shelf

180
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:02,690
shelf
 

181
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,390
shelf
you've got the ethernet coming out one

182
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
you've got the ethernet coming out one
 

183
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,280
you've got the ethernet coming out one
side you got HDMI coming out the other

184
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,290
side you got HDMI coming out the other
 

185
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,170
side you got HDMI coming out the other
and power coming out here and video

186
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,180
and power coming out here and video
 

187
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,180
and power coming out here and video
coming out here and Jeep and all that

188
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,190
coming out here and Jeep and all that
 

189
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,680
coming out here and Jeep and all that
kind of stuff so what they've done is

190
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:11,690
kind of stuff so what they've done is
 

191
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,160
kind of stuff so what they've done is
they've provided a basically an adapter

192
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,170
they've provided a basically an adapter
 

193
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,680
they've provided a basically an adapter
that is going to simply plug in to the

194
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:17,690
that is going to simply plug in to the
 

195
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,110
that is going to simply plug in to the
board to the headphone jack and the dual

196
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,120
board to the headphone jack and the dual
 

197
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,530
board to the headphone jack and the dual
HDMI output and what does it do it puts

198
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:23,540
HDMI output and what does it do it puts
 

199
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,040
HDMI output and what does it do it puts
all of those jacks directly onto the

200
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,050
all of those jacks directly onto the
 

201
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,370
all of those jacks directly onto the
back of the Raspberry Pi so I'm just

202
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,380
back of the Raspberry Pi so I'm just
 

203
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,350
back of the Raspberry Pi so I'm just
given that a nice snug little push I'm

204
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,360
given that a nice snug little push I'm
 

205
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,520
given that a nice snug little push I'm
being careful I'm actually holding the

206
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:35,530
being careful I'm actually holding the
 

207
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,500
being careful I'm actually holding the
the points on the board that I'm pushing

208
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,510
the points on the board that I'm pushing
 

209
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,210
the points on the board that I'm pushing
so I don't accidentally break that off

210
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,220
so I don't accidentally break that off
 

211
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,360
so I don't accidentally break that off
break the solder joints for that I don't

212
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,370
break the solder joints for that I don't
 

213
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,710
break the solder joints for that I don't
know that it would happen but I want to

214
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
know that it would happen but I want to
 

215
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,810
know that it would happen but I want to
be careful so there you have it so this

216
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:46,820
be careful so there you have it so this
 

217
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,730
be careful so there you have it so this
is going to put the audio and the dual

218
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:48,740
is going to put the audio and the dual
 

219
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,830
is going to put the audio and the dual
HDMI at the back along with USB USB 3

220
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
HDMI at the back along with USB USB 3
 

221
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,510
HDMI at the back along with USB USB 3
and Gigabit Ethernet further into the

222
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:58,520
and Gigabit Ethernet further into the
 

223
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,610
and Gigabit Ethernet further into the
box okay we've got some thermal pads

224
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:00,620
box okay we've got some thermal pads
 

225
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,140
box okay we've got some thermal pads
we're gonna need those to make thermal

226
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,150
we're gonna need those to make thermal
 

227
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,120
we're gonna need those to make thermal
contact with the SOC and the the RAM and

228
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,130
contact with the SOC and the the RAM and
 

229
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,150
contact with the SOC and the the RAM and
here is the interior of the argon one

230
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
here is the interior of the argon one
 

231
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,600
here is the interior of the argon one
case for the Raspberry Pi 4 so we can

232
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:13,610
case for the Raspberry Pi 4 so we can
 

233
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,350
case for the Raspberry Pi 4 so we can
see a fan controller with GPIO GPIO

234
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
see a fan controller with GPIO GPIO
 

235
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,430
see a fan controller with GPIO GPIO
riser pins so the Raspberry Pi 4 is

236
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
riser pins so the Raspberry Pi 4 is
 

237
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,860
riser pins so the Raspberry Pi 4 is
going to connect with the GPIO

238
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:23,870
going to connect with the GPIO
 

239
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,950
going to connect with the GPIO
so it's actually this is really really

240
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
so it's actually this is really really
 

241
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,200
so it's actually this is really really
cool if I can show you internally so

242
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,210
cool if I can show you internally so
 

243
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,620
cool if I can show you internally so
you're not losing the GPIO what it

244
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:32,630
you're not losing the GPIO what it
 

245
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,390
you're not losing the GPIO what it
actually does is under this magnetic

246
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
actually does is under this magnetic
 

247
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,030
actually does is under this magnetic
hood here if I can just get that off

248
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,040
hood here if I can just get that off
 

249
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,770
hood here if I can just get that off
there we go

250
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:38,780
there we go
 

251
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,760
there we go
it has the gpio risen out from the board

252
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:42,770
it has the gpio risen out from the board
 

253
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,010
it has the gpio risen out from the board
so here's where the actual GPIO is and

254
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,020
so here's where the actual GPIO is and
 

255
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,690
so here's where the actual GPIO is and
it displaces it over here with a nice H

256
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:48,700
it displaces it over here with a nice H
 

257
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,940
it displaces it over here with a nice H
GPIO header identifier so you don't have

258
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:51,950
GPIO header identifier so you don't have
 

259
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,100
GPIO header identifier so you don't have
to look for that card how cool is that

260
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,110
to look for that card how cool is that
 

261
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,840
to look for that card how cool is that
so if you want to get into maker tech

262
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:55,850
so if you want to get into maker tech
 

263
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,270
so if you want to get into maker tech
while this is looking so beautiful you

264
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,280
while this is looking so beautiful you
 

265
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,370
while this is looking so beautiful you
can easily remove this magnetic cover

266
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:00,380
can easily remove this magnetic cover
 

267
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,260
can easily remove this magnetic cover
and access the GPIO alright so let's get

268
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,270
and access the GPIO alright so let's get
 

269
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,879
and access the GPIO alright so let's get
this thing assembled and put together so

270
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:06,889
this thing assembled and put together so
 

271
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:12,880
this thing assembled and put together so
we can fire it up now I mentioned that

272
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:12,890
we can fire it up now I mentioned that
 

273
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,880
we can fire it up now I mentioned that
this is both active and passive cooling

274
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:15,890
this is both active and passive cooling
 

275
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,480
this is both active and passive cooling
so keep in mind while this is a plastic

276
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:19,490
so keep in mind while this is a plastic
 

277
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,610
so keep in mind while this is a plastic
base for the for the argon one this is

278
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:24,620
base for the for the argon one this is
 

279
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,730
base for the for the argon one this is
an aluminum cover okay so this is for

280
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:27,740
an aluminum cover okay so this is for
 

281
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,890
an aluminum cover okay so this is for
heat dissipation the aluminum actually

282
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:29,900
heat dissipation the aluminum actually
 

283
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,020
heat dissipation the aluminum actually
kind of pulls the heat away from the SOC

284
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,030
kind of pulls the heat away from the SOC
 

285
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,110
kind of pulls the heat away from the SOC
and these are the two contacts so we've

286
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
and these are the two contacts so we've
 

287
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,350
and these are the two contacts so we've
got one for the the SOC itself and one

288
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:38,360
got one for the the SOC itself and one
 

289
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,210
got one for the the SOC itself and one
for the RAM and then we've got the

290
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,220
for the RAM and then we've got the
 

291
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,900
for the RAM and then we've got the
active cooler so if it still gets too

292
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:43,910
active cooler so if it still gets too
 

293
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,350
active cooler so if it still gets too
hot even though it is dissipating the

294
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
hot even though it is dissipating the
 

295
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,540
hot even though it is dissipating the
heat through the aluminum then the fan

296
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,550
heat through the aluminum then the fan
 

297
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,540
heat through the aluminum then the fan
which is on a fan controller will spin

298
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,550
which is on a fan controller will spin
 

299
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,260
which is on a fan controller will spin
up to designated speeds that you specify

300
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,270
up to designated speeds that you specify
 

301
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,120
up to designated speeds that you specify
based on temperatures I'm going to show

302
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,130
based on temperatures I'm going to show
 

303
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,529
based on temperatures I'm going to show
you how all that works in just a few

304
00:07:59,529 --> 00:07:59,539
you how all that works in just a few
 

305
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:02,500
you how all that works in just a few
moments so I need this thermal pad which

306
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,510
moments so I need this thermal pad which
 

307
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,659
moments so I need this thermal pad which
is going to make a nice little contact

308
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:04,669
is going to make a nice little contact
 

309
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,870
is going to make a nice little contact
with with the S these are not the

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,890
with with the S these are not the
thermal pads these are feet whoa I was

312
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:11,900
thermal pads these are feet whoa I was
 

313
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,710
thermal pads these are feet whoa I was
like hey thermal pad these are feet for

314
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
like hey thermal pad these are feet for
 

315
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,620
like hey thermal pad these are feet for
the case this is gonna go right on here

316
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:19,630
the case this is gonna go right on here
 

317
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:25,120
the case this is gonna go right on here
cool I can do that first can't I will do

318
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,130
cool I can do that first can't I will do
 

319
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,800
cool I can do that first can't I will do
things out of order I'm sure that that's

320
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:26,810
things out of order I'm sure that that's
 

321
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,980
things out of order I'm sure that that's
what the instructions say to do put the

322
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:29,990
what the instructions say to do put the
 

323
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,680
what the instructions say to do put the
feet on first just like Ravi at category

324
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:32,690
feet on first just like Ravi at category
 

325
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,820
feet on first just like Ravi at category
five that way I don't forget or lose

326
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:36,830
five that way I don't forget or lose
 

327
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,000
five that way I don't forget or lose
them how many people have a whole bunch

328
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,010
them how many people have a whole bunch
 

329
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,149
them how many people have a whole bunch
of these rubberized feet sitting in

330
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:43,159
of these rubberized feet sitting in
 

331
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,350
of these rubberized feet sitting in
their tool chest there we

332
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
their tool chest there we
 

333
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,210
their tool chest there we
okay that's done now I can put those

334
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,220
okay that's done now I can put those
 

335
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,939
okay that's done now I can put those
aside and now I do have these thermal

336
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:49,949
aside and now I do have these thermal
 

337
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,549
aside and now I do have these thermal
pads which there we are

338
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:52,559
pads which there we are
 

339
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,189
pads which there we are
they have like us an adhesive on either

340
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:55,199
they have like us an adhesive on either
 

341
00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:00,079
they have like us an adhesive on either
side so just peel off that plastic make

342
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:00,089
side so just peel off that plastic make
 

343
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,479
side so just peel off that plastic make
sure you do you don't want to put the

344
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:02,489
sure you do you don't want to put the
 

345
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:06,369
sure you do you don't want to put the
plastic on there and have it melt on you

346
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:06,379

 

347
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,929

when you're doing a TV show it's good to

terrible for peeling plastic off the

352
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:15,660
terrible for peeling plastic off the
 

353
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:24,559
terrible for peeling plastic off the
back of an adhesive and that just goes

354
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:24,569
back of an adhesive and that just goes
 

355
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:41,539
back of an adhesive and that just goes
right on there same with this one there

356
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:41,549
right on there same with this one there
 

357
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:42,400

okay so observe the GPIO the positioning

388
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:31,579
okay so observe the GPIO the positioning
 

389
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,489
okay so observe the GPIO the positioning
of it and we're going to position that

390
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:33,499
of it and we're going to position that
 

391
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,189
of it and we're going to position that
directly over the GPIO here careful not

00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:36,199
directly over the GPIO here careful not
 

393
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,470
directly over the GPIO here careful not
to bend any pins and I'm just going to

394
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
to bend any pins and I'm just going to
 

395
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,639
to bend any pins and I'm just going to
turn this around so you can see this

396
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:39,649
turn this around so you can see this
 

397
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:40,419
turn this around so you can see this
side as well

398
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:40,429
side as well
 

399
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:42,669
side as well
and I'm just going to push that down

400
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:42,679
and I'm just going to push that down
 

401
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:48,160
and I'm just going to push that down
nice and snug and it just goes in just

402
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,170
nice and snug and it just goes in just
 

403
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:53,970
nice and snug and it just goes in just
like a GPIO there we are

404
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:53,980
like a GPIO there we are
 

405
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,819
like a GPIO there we are
make sure everything is aligned nicely

406
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:56,829
make sure everything is aligned nicely
 

407
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,919
make sure everything is aligned nicely
and we've got all these screws I presume

408
00:10:59,919 --> 00:10:59,929
and we've got all these screws I presume
 

409
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:03,309
and we've got all these screws I presume
it's time to put them all together so it

410
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:03,319
it's time to put them all together so it
 

411
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,319
it's time to put them all together so it
looks like I've got one two three four

412
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:05,329
looks like I've got one two three four
 

413
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:08,559
looks like I've got one two three four
spots to screw in internally and then

414
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:08,569
spots to screw in internally and then
 

415
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,689
spots to screw in internally and then
four for the cover so it's going to be

416
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:10,699
four for the cover so it's going to be
 

417
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:22,600
four for the cover so it's going to be
these smaller screws on the inside

418
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:22,610

 

419
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,940

there we are and note that there is a

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:24,950
there we are and note that there is a
 

421
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,829
there we are and note that there is a
hole on the Raspberry Pi where there is

422
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
hole on the Raspberry Pi where there is
 

423
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,750
hole on the Raspberry Pi where there is
no standoff so you're not screwing into

424
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:28,760
no standoff so you're not screwing into
 

425
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,610
no standoff so you're not screwing into
that and we're leaving these four outer

426
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:30,620
that and we're leaving these four outer
 

427
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,610
that and we're leaving these four outer
ones for the bottom of the case so now

428
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:33,620
ones for the bottom of the case so now
 

429
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
ones for the bottom of the case so now
I'm just gonna put that on top and grab

430
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:35,630
I'm just gonna put that on top and grab
 

431
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,590
I'm just gonna put that on top and grab
the four longer screws and we're going

432
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:38,600
the four longer screws and we're going
 

433
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:53,110
the four longer screws and we're going
to put those ones in there we have it

434
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
to put those ones in there we have it
 

435
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,170
to put those ones in there we have it
congratulations you did it you did it it

00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,230
card with the latest version of a
 

469
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,890
card with the latest version of a
Raspberry Pi OS on it I wanted to say

470
00:12:59,890 --> 00:12:59,900
Raspberry Pi OS on it I wanted to say
 

471
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,570
Raspberry Pi OS on it I wanted to say
raspbian but they've changed the name so

472
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:01,580
raspbian but they've changed the name so
 

473
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,670
raspbian but they've changed the name so
it's called Raspberry Pi OS now I

474
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
it's called Raspberry Pi OS now I
 

475
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,670
it's called Raspberry Pi OS now I
tracked down my 5 volt 3.5 amp power

476
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:06,680
tracked down my 5 volt 3.5 amp power
 

477
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,920
tracked down my 5 volt 3.5 amp power
supply and just keep in mind the

478
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:08,930
supply and just keep in mind the
 

479
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,710
supply and just keep in mind the
Raspberry Pi 4 is a power-hungry beast

480
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:11,720
Raspberry Pi 4 is a power-hungry beast
 

481
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,740
Raspberry Pi 4 is a power-hungry beast
so while I could probably power it with

482
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:14,750
so while I could probably power it with
 

483
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,050
so while I could probably power it with
my 3 amp power supply or potentially

484
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,060
my 3 amp power supply or potentially
 

485
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,180
my 3 amp power supply or potentially
even something a little bit less you

486
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,190
even something a little bit less you
 

487
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,070
even something a little bit less you
could damage your SD card if there isn't

488
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,080
could damage your SD card if there isn't
 

489
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,470
could damage your SD card if there isn't
enough power and that's surprisingly

490
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,480
enough power and that's surprisingly
 

491
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,080
enough power and that's surprisingly
easy to do let's say I willy-nilly plug

492
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,090
easy to do let's say I willy-nilly plug
 

493
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,120
easy to do let's say I willy-nilly plug
in a USB device that draws an amp or

494
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,130
in a USB device that draws an amp or
 

495
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,250
in a USB device that draws an amp or
something from the USB port well there

496
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,260
something from the USB port well there
 

497
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,400
something from the USB port well there
you go so I prefer to err on the side of

498
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,410
you go so I prefer to err on the side of
 

499
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,250
you go so I prefer to err on the side of
caution so using a 3.5 amp power supply

500
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,260
caution so using a 3.5 amp power supply
 

501
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,500
caution so using a 3.5 amp power supply
is just playing it safe that'll ensure

502
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,510
is just playing it safe that'll ensure
 

503
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,450
is just playing it safe that'll ensure
that I get the best reliability out of

504
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:40,460
that I get the best reliability out of
 

505
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,390
that I get the best reliability out of
my Raspberry Pi 4 alright with all the

506
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:43,400
my Raspberry Pi 4 alright with all the
 

507
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,460
my Raspberry Pi 4 alright with all the
cables connected I'm going to fire up

508
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:45,470
cables connected I'm going to fire up
 

509
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,190
cables connected I'm going to fire up
the Raspberry Pi 4 with a single press

510
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,200
the Raspberry Pi 4 with a single press
 

511
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,610
the Raspberry Pi 4 with a single press
on the power button on the Aragon one

512
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:50,620
on the power button on the Aragon one
 

513
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,400
on the power button on the Aragon one
and I can hear just a little spin of a

514
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,410
and I can hear just a little spin of a
 

515
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,130
and I can hear just a little spin of a
fan I don't even think you'll be able to

516
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,140
fan I don't even think you'll be able to
 

517
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,510
fan I don't even think you'll be able to
hear that with our compressors and

518
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:58,520
hear that with our compressors and
 

519
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,670
hear that with our compressors and
everything else but it's just a slight I

520
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:00,680
everything else but it's just a slight I
 

521
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,560
everything else but it's just a slight I
can tell that the fan has turned on and

522
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,570
can tell that the fan has turned on and
 

523
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,480
can tell that the fan has turned on and
it's off and I am booted into my distro

524
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,490
it's off and I am booted into my distro
 

525
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,800
it's off and I am booted into my distro
man that is great ok one thing I'm just

526
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:11,810
man that is great ok one thing I'm just
 

527
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,100
man that is great ok one thing I'm just
going to mention right out the gate is

528
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,110
going to mention right out the gate is
 

529
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,180
going to mention right out the gate is
running cool feels good powered up great

530
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,190

 

531
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,860

there's one

532
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:22,870
there's one
 

533
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,370
there's one
that I think are gone one potentially

534
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:26,380
that I think are gone one potentially
 

535
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,170
that I think are gone one potentially
misses the boat on and that's that we're

536
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,180
misses the boat on and that's that we're
 

537
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,710
misses the boat on and that's that we're
still using the micro-hdmi okay so I'm

538
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:31,720
still using the micro-hdmi okay so I'm
 

539
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,510
still using the micro-hdmi okay so I'm
still having to use a micro HDMI to HDMI

540
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:33,520
still having to use a micro HDMI to HDMI
 

541
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,150
still having to use a micro HDMI to HDMI
cable in order to plug this into my TV

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
cable in order to plug this into my TV
 

543
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,829
cable in order to plug this into my TV
and into the capture devices so that you

544
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
and into the capture devices so that you
 

545
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,460
and into the capture devices so that you
can see it at home however now while I

546
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,470
can see it at home however now while I
 

547
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,290
can see it at home however now while I
feel like a B they missed the boat on

548
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,300
feel like a B they missed the boat on
 

549
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,000
feel like a B they missed the boat on
that they could have made it full HDMI

550
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,010
that they could have made it full HDMI
 

551
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,260
that they could have made it full HDMI
they've got room for it they could have

552
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,270
they've got room for it they could have
 

553
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,110
they've got room for it they could have
done that and besides they're in control

554
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
done that and besides they're in control
 

555
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,470
done that and besides they're in control
of what they put on the case however as

556
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
of what they put on the case however as
 

557
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,640
of what they put on the case however as
I move this around it's not janky at all

558
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:56,650
I move this around it's not janky at all
 

559
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,360
I move this around it's not janky at all
there's no disconnection on the HDMI and

560
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,370
there's no disconnection on the HDMI and
 

561
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,250
there's no disconnection on the HDMI and
I don't know about you but when I plug

562
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,260
I don't know about you but when I plug
 

563
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,700
I don't know about you but when I plug
my Raspberry Pi board directly into an

564
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:05,710
my Raspberry Pi board directly into an
 

565
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,650
my Raspberry Pi board directly into an
HDMI cable just like I've done with the

566
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:07,660
HDMI cable just like I've done with the
 

567
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,740
HDMI cable just like I've done with the
argon one if I move it ever so slightly

568
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:10,750
argon one if I move it ever so slightly
 

569
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,710
argon one if I move it ever so slightly
the screen goes green or it goes kind of

570
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:13,720
the screen goes green or it goes kind of
 

571
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,050
the screen goes green or it goes kind of
digitally distorted or something and so

572
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,060
digitally distorted or something and so
 

573
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,490
digitally distorted or something and so
I've got to jiggle that cable again and

574
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:17,500
I've got to jiggle that cable again and
 

575
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,320
I've got to jiggle that cable again and
then if it ever gets moved I lose that

576
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,330
then if it ever gets moved I lose that
 

577
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,329
then if it ever gets moved I lose that
connectivity and it causes problems

578
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:21,339
connectivity and it causes problems
 

579
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,360
connectivity and it causes problems
well the argon one seems like even

580
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,370
well the argon one seems like even
 

581
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,880
well the argon one seems like even
though it's still micro HDMI which mm

582
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:28,890
though it's still micro HDMI which mm
 

583
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,130
though it's still micro HDMI which mm
it's not the perfect connection for this

584
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,140
it's not the perfect connection for this
 

585
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,470
it's not the perfect connection for this
kind of thing even though it is still

586
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
kind of thing even though it is still
 

587
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,199
kind of thing even though it is still
micro HDMI it is significantly more

588
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:37,209
micro HDMI it is significantly more
 

589
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,960
micro HDMI it is significantly more
solid than the micro HDMI that's built

590
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:39,970
solid than the micro HDMI that's built
 

591
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,720
solid than the micro HDMI that's built
into the Raspberry Pi and I noticed that

592
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,730
into the Raspberry Pi and I noticed that
 

593
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,079
into the Raspberry Pi and I noticed that
immediately so I think you will

594
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:46,089
immediately so I think you will
 

595
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,720
immediately so I think you will
appreciate that as I mentioned I'm using

596
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:48,730
appreciate that as I mentioned I'm using
 

597
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,750
appreciate that as I mentioned I'm using
an HD micro HDMI to HDMI cable you can

598
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:51,760
an HD micro HDMI to HDMI cable you can
 

599
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,230
an HD micro HDMI to HDMI cable you can
also use a micro HDMI to full-sized HDMI

600
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,240
also use a micro HDMI to full-sized HDMI
 

601
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,900
also use a micro HDMI to full-sized HDMI
adapter if you like and the argon one

602
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:57,910
adapter if you like and the argon one
 

603
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,630
adapter if you like and the argon one
case is definitely giving me a better

604
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:00,640
case is definitely giving me a better
 

605
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,150
case is definitely giving me a better
connection to that HDMI output alright I

606
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
connection to that HDMI output alright I
 

607
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,290
connection to that HDMI output alright I
got a plug in a keyboard

608
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,300

 

609
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300

I've already plugged in my USB wireless

610
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,310
I've already plugged in my USB wireless
 

611
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,560
I've already plugged in my USB wireless
mouse I've got my keyboard here and I'm

612
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,570
mouse I've got my keyboard here and I'm
 

613
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,030
mouse I've got my keyboard here and I'm
just gonna plug that into the USB 2

614
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,040
just gonna plug that into the USB 2
 

615
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,680
just gonna plug that into the USB 2
because I'm gonna save those USB 3's for

616
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:19,690
because I'm gonna save those USB 3's for
 

617
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,740
because I'm gonna save those USB 3's for
something else there we go alright so

618
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:24,750
something else there we go alright so
 

619
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,420
something else there we go alright so
the firt Oh a little bit of latency

620
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:27,430
the firt Oh a little bit of latency
 

621
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,630
the firt Oh a little bit of latency
there the first thing that I want to

622
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:30,640
there the first thing that I want to
 

623
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,030
there the first thing that I want to
consider is I want to I mentioned that

624
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
consider is I want to I mentioned that
 

625
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,150
consider is I want to I mentioned that
this is

626
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
this is
 

627
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,150
this is
that this is a smart power switch so the

628
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,160
that this is a smart power switch so the
 

629
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,780
that this is a smart power switch so the
power switch is programmable the heat

630
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:39,790
power switch is programmable the heat
 

631
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,769
power switch is programmable the heat
dissipation the active heat cooler is

632
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:43,779
dissipation the active heat cooler is
 

633
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,590
dissipation the active heat cooler is
actually programmable and I'm starting

634
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
actually programmable and I'm starting
 

635
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,119
actually programmable and I'm starting
to feel a little bit of warmth there

636
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:49,129
to feel a little bit of warmth there
 

637
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:50,800
to feel a little bit of warmth there
this is what's making me think of that

638
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,810
this is what's making me think of that
 

639
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,079
this is what's making me think of that
cooling system so you can see there's

640
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:53,089
cooling system so you can see there's
 

641
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,970
cooling system so you can see there's
vents at the side and this is doing a

642
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:54,980
vents at the side and this is doing a
 

643
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,650
vents at the side and this is doing a
really good job of cooling the Raspberry

644
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:56,660
really good job of cooling the Raspberry
 

645
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,439
really good job of cooling the Raspberry
Pi for however it is starting to get

646
00:16:59,439 --> 00:16:59,449
Pi for however it is starting to get
 

647
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,509
Pi for however it is starting to get
warm and I want that fan to come on if

648
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
warm and I want that fan to come on if
 

649
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,429
warm and I want that fan to come on if
it starts to get a little bit too warm

650
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:03,439
it starts to get a little bit too warm
 

651
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,240
it starts to get a little bit too warm
so it has that passive cooling from the

652
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,250
so it has that passive cooling from the
 

653
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,250
so it has that passive cooling from the
aluminum and it has an active cooling

654
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,260
aluminum and it has an active cooling
 

655
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,590
aluminum and it has an active cooling
system the fan that will turn on as

656
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
system the fan that will turn on as
 

657
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,929
system the fan that will turn on as
needed so let's get into our terminal

658
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:13,939
needed so let's get into our terminal
 

659
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,419
needed so let's get into our terminal
and I need to become root so I'm just

660
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:16,429
and I need to become root so I'm just
 

661
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,350
and I need to become root so I'm just
gonna type sudo su - and there boom

662
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:20,360
gonna type sudo su - and there boom
 

663
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,549
gonna type sudo su - and there boom
I am root so I am root you see the

664
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
I am root so I am root you see the
 

665
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,279
I am root so I am root you see the
instructions that say to go curl and

666
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:27,289
instructions that say to go curl and
 

667
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:31,870
instructions that say to go curl and
then the URL HTTP colon slash slash

668
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:31,880
then the URL HTTP colon slash slash
 

669
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,049
then the URL HTTP colon slash slash
download dot argon-40 calm slash argon

670
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:38,059
download dot argon-40 calm slash argon
 

671
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,789
download dot argon-40 calm slash argon
and then it's one the number one SH and

672
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
and then it's one the number one SH and
 

673
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,260
and then it's one the number one SH and
then a pipe why can't I think of the

674
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,270
then a pipe why can't I think of the
 

675
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,080
then a pipe why can't I think of the
word bash okay so I want to break down

676
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,090
word bash okay so I want to break down
 

677
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,789
word bash okay so I want to break down
that command for you okay what I'm

678
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
that command for you okay what I'm
 

679
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,110
that command for you okay what I'm
actually doing is I'm telling it to use

680
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,120
actually doing is I'm telling it to use
 

681
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,399
actually doing is I'm telling it to use
curl to download basically to the output

682
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:00,409
curl to download basically to the output
 

683
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:04,570
curl to download basically to the output
this script from download argon-40 calm

684
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:04,580
this script from download argon-40 calm
 

685
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,279
this script from download argon-40 calm
slash argon one dot sh but instead of

686
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,289
slash argon one dot sh but instead of
 

687
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,200
slash argon one dot sh but instead of
outputting it to my screen which is what

688
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,210
outputting it to my screen which is what
 

689
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,710
outputting it to my screen which is what
would happen if i remove the pipe bash

690
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:13,720
would happen if i remove the pipe bash
 

691
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,690
would happen if i remove the pipe bash
see that that's the script so the pipe

692
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:16,700
see that that's the script so the pipe
 

693
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,830
see that that's the script so the pipe
bash says let's actually run that script

694
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:20,840
bash says let's actually run that script
 

695
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,590
bash says let's actually run that script
in bash it's piping that output into

696
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
in bash it's piping that output into
 

697
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,669
in bash it's piping that output into
bash so if i wanted to take a different

698
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
bash so if i wanted to take a different
 

699
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,120
bash so if i wanted to take a different
approach and say i want to control what

700
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,130
approach and say i want to control what
 

701
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,620
approach and say i want to control what
this is actually doing or i want to

702
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:32,630
this is actually doing or i want to
 

703
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,350
this is actually doing or i want to
modify this installer the scripts before

704
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
modify this installer the scripts before
 

705
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,659
modify this installer the scripts before
i actually install it well let's take a

706
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:37,669
i actually install it well let's take a
 

707
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,899
i actually install it well let's take a
different approach so instead I'm going

708
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:40,909
different approach so instead I'm going
 

709
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:46,740
different approach so instead I'm going
to W get that

710
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,750

 

711
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,960

or I could have piped the curl so I'm

712
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:48,970
or I could have piped the curl so I'm
 

713
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,850
or I could have piped the curl so I'm
gonna W get oh and it's kind of monkey

714
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:50,860
gonna W get oh and it's kind of monkey
 

715
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,260
gonna W get oh and it's kind of monkey
with my terminal window there I'm going

716
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,270
with my terminal window there I'm going
 

717
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,880
with my terminal window there I'm going
to control C so that you can see that a

718
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:53,890
to control C so that you can see that a
 

719
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,560
to control C so that you can see that a
little better

720
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,570
little better
 

721
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,260
little better
W get oh there we go

722
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,270
W get oh there we go
 

723
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,750
W get oh there we go
so W get is another download tool but

724
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:00,760
so W get is another download tool but
 

725
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,950
so W get is another download tool but
this one is going to actually save the

726
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:01,960
this one is going to actually save the
 

727
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,280
this one is going to actually save the
file to our GaN one SH now it's grabbing

728
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,290
file to our GaN one SH now it's grabbing
 

729
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,100
file to our GaN one SH now it's grabbing
the file I've got it and all I have to

730
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,110
the file I've got it and all I have to
 

731
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,530
the file I've got it and all I have to
do in order to edit that file is I can

732
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:10,540
do in order to edit that file is I can
 

733
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,590
do in order to edit that file is I can
use Nano for example so Nano are gone

734
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
use Nano for example so Nano are gone
 

735
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,470
use Nano for example so Nano are gone
one dot s H it's gonna bring it up into

736
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
one dot s H it's gonna bring it up into
 

737
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,380
one dot s H it's gonna bring it up into
my favorite text editor all right so

738
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,390
my favorite text editor all right so
 

739
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,030
my favorite text editor all right so
first thing that I see and I should say

740
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,040
first thing that I see and I should say
 

741
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,290
first thing that I see and I should say
that one of the nice things about doing

742
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:22,300
that one of the nice things about doing
 

743
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,180
that one of the nice things about doing
it this way is that you can inspect the

744
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,190
it this way is that you can inspect the
 

745
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,370
it this way is that you can inspect the
code it's this is one of the things

746
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:26,380
code it's this is one of the things
 

747
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,140
code it's this is one of the things
about open source and the way the Linux

748
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,150
about open source and the way the Linux
 

749
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,090
about open source and the way the Linux
works is you can look through and see if

750
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,100
works is you can look through and see if
 

751
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,230
works is you can look through and see if
there's anything that you want to change

752
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,240
there's anything that you want to change
 

753
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,510
there's anything that you want to change
or whatever you want to do but so first

754
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
or whatever you want to do but so first
 

755
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,400
or whatever you want to do but so first
of all I see a couple of functions just

756
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,410
of all I see a couple of functions just
 

757
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,260
of all I see a couple of functions just
basically so that they can reuse some of

758
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,270
basically so that they can reuse some of
 

759
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,630
basically so that they can reuse some of
the things like creating a file touching

760
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:39,640
the things like creating a file touching
 

761
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,900
the things like creating a file touching
it and setting the permissions before

762
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:41,910
it and setting the permissions before
 

763
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,900
it and setting the permissions before
adding the content check if a package is

764
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:45,910
adding the content check if a package is
 

765
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,540
adding the content check if a package is
installed it's gonna allow them to see a

766
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:48,550
installed it's gonna allow them to see a
 

767
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,640
installed it's gonna allow them to see a
response code of either ng which is

768
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:50,650
response code of either ng which is
 

769
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,940
response code of either ng which is
presumably not good or okay if the

770
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:53,950
presumably not good or okay if the
 

771
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,790
presumably not good or okay if the
package is not found in dpkg query and

772
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:56,800
package is not found in dpkg query and
 

773
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,920
package is not found in dpkg query and
that is going to be called further down

774
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:58,930
that is going to be called further down
 

775
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,900
that is going to be called further down
using this loop which grabs a package

776
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:00,910
using this loop which grabs a package
 

777
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,130
using this loop which grabs a package
list like raspy - GPIO Python sharp-eyed

778
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,140
list like raspy - GPIO Python sharp-eyed
 

779
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,230
list like raspy - GPIO Python sharp-eyed
on GPIO and so on and so forth so

780
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,240
on GPIO and so on and so forth so
 

781
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,000
on GPIO and so on and so forth so
basically packages that are going to get

782
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,010
basically packages that are going to get
 

783
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,830
basically packages that are going to get
installed with apt-get so then it goes

784
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:10,840
installed with apt-get so then it goes
 

785
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,250
installed with apt-get so then it goes
through a loop here in package list and

786
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:14,260
through a loop here in package list and
 

787
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,560
through a loop here in package list and
it goes through that loop installing and

788
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,570
it goes through that loop installing and
 

789
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,120
it goes through that loop installing and
approving the installation of each of

790
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,130
approving the installation of each of
 

791
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,640
approving the installation of each of
those packages but if any of the

792
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:20,650
those packages but if any of the
 

793
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,430
those packages but if any of the
packages fail to install response with

794
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
packages fail to install response with
 

795
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,890
packages fail to install response with
ng then it's gonna say hey there's

796
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:25,900
ng then it's gonna say hey there's
 

797
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,420
ng then it's gonna say hey there's
something wrong you're not connected to

798
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:27,430
something wrong you're not connected to
 

799
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,700
something wrong you're not connected to
the internet and it's going to die if

800
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:29,710
the internet and it's going to die if
 

801
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,760
the internet and it's going to die if
however it because there's no else it's

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:32,770
however it because there's no else it's
 

803
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,710
however it because there's no else it's
just going to resume if that doesn't

804
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
just going to resume if that doesn't
 

805
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,960
just going to resume if that doesn't
happen so then it's going to move on to

806
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:36,970
happen so then it's going to move on to
 

807
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,050
happen so then it's going to move on to
here so we've named the daemon Argan one

808
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,060
here so we've named the daemon Argan one
 

809
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,680
here so we've named the daemon Argan one
D and we've got a power button script

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,250
going to be created in user slash bin
 

813
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,740
going to be created in user slash bin

and so on and so forth so those are just
 

823
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,200
and so on and so forth so those are just
the file names so that they can be

the file names so that they can be
 

825
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,300

831
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,710
cereal that must be cereal that's just
my guess okay and then we're starting to

832
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
my guess okay and then we're starting to
 

833
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,270
my guess okay and then we're starting to
write out the file so if the Damon

834
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,280
write out the file so if the Damon
 

835
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,670
write out the file so if the Damon
config file does not exist let's created

836
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:20,680
config file does not exist let's created
 

837
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,710
config file does not exist let's created
so we touch it for some reason they're

838
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
so we touch it for some reason they're
 

839
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,530
so we touch it for some reason they're
not using their their function here

840
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:25,540
not using their their function here
 

841
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,630
not using their their function here
maybe that's a bug and we could fix it

842
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:27,640
maybe that's a bug and we could fix it
 

843
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,580
maybe that's a bug and we could fix it
it doesn't matter it's doing exactly the

844
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:29,590
it doesn't matter it's doing exactly the
 

845
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,910
it doesn't matter it's doing exactly the
same thing it's just funny that it it is

846
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:32,920
same thing it's just funny that it it is
 

847
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,680
same thing it's just funny that it it is
happening redundantly they could have

848
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:34,690
happening redundantly they could have
 

849
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,270
happening redundantly they could have
used the function these are comments and

850
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,280
used the function these are comments and
 

851
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,950
used the function these are comments and
then at the bottom of the config file

852
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:37,960
then at the bottom of the config file
 

853
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,610
then at the bottom of the config file
are the temperature to fan speed ratios

854
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:41,620
are the temperature to fan speed ratios
 

855
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,910
are the temperature to fan speed ratios
so if it hits 55 degrees C it's gonna

856
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:44,920
so if it hits 55 degrees C it's gonna
 

857
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,700
so if it hits 55 degrees C it's gonna
set the fan speed to 10% if it hits 60

858
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:47,710
set the fan speed to 10% if it hits 60
 

859
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,140
set the fan speed to 10% if it hits 60
degrees C it's gonna set the fan speed

860
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,150
degrees C it's gonna set the fan speed
 

861
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,160
degrees C it's gonna set the fan speed
to 55 and 65 degrees Celsius is going to

862
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,170
to 55 and 65 degrees Celsius is going to
 

863
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,550
to 55 and 65 degrees Celsius is going to
set the fan speed to a full 100% so

864
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:56,560
set the fan speed to a full 100% so
 

865
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,800
set the fan speed to a full 100% so
hopefully we never hit that point so

866
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:58,810
hopefully we never hit that point so
 

867
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,170
hopefully we never hit that point so
those configuration items of course they

868
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,180
those configuration items of course they
 

869
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,760
those configuration items of course they
can be changed here before you install

870
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:02,770
can be changed here before you install
 

871
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,770
can be changed here before you install
it or and that's just going to change

872
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:04,780
it or and that's just going to change
 

873
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,870
it or and that's just going to change
the output of the Damon config file or

874
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
the output of the Damon config file or
 

875
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,360
the output of the Damon config file or
of course you can edit that later or you

876
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,370
of course you can edit that later or you
 

877
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,440
of course you can edit that later or you
can use the tool that they're going to

878
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,450
can use the tool that they're going to
 

879
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,810
can use the tool that they're going to
give you in order to make those changes

880
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:12,820
give you in order to make those changes
 

881
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,740
give you in order to make those changes

moving down power button script this is

902
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:41,920
moving down power button script this is
 

903
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,710
moving down power button script this is
going to be what happens when you push

904
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:43,720
going to be what happens when you push
 

905
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,150
going to be what happens when you push
that power button so again a Python

906
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,160
that power button so again a Python
 

907
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,130
that power button so again a Python
script lets grabbing the bus is grabbing

script lets grabbing the bus is grabbing
 

909
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,990
script lets grabbing the bus is grabbing
the GPIO OS the time and that's not just

910
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
the GPIO OS the time and that's not just
 

911
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,790
the GPIO OS the time and that's not just
the time that's the like the counter and

912
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:53,800
the time that's the like the counter and
 

913
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,610
the time that's the like the counter and
the clock and everything else okay

914
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:56,620
the clock and everything else okay
 

915
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,590
the clock and everything else okay
what's happening here so checks the

916
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:58,600
what's happening here so checks the
 

917
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,490
what's happening here so checks the
revision again and acts accordingly

918
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:01,500
revision again and acts accordingly
 

919
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,690
revision again and acts accordingly
because it may be a little bit different

920
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:03,700
because it may be a little bit different

925
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,009
board
so it's checking the shutdown check this

926
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:13,019
so it's checking the shutdown check this
 

927
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,799
so it's checking the shutdown check this
is a function so yeah when you push the

928
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:15,809
is a function so yeah when you push the
 

929
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:18,469
is a function so yeah when you push the
button it responds so when you push it

930
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:18,479
button it responds so when you push it
 

931
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:21,229
button it responds so when you push it
when you okay so it's incrementing

932
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:21,239
when you okay so it's incrementing
 

933
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,109
when you okay so it's incrementing
something called pulse time that's a an

934
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:23,119
something called pulse time that's a an
 

935
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,200
something called pulse time that's a an
integer string that well not an integer

936
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,210
integer string that well not an integer
 

937
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,249
integer string that well not an integer
string but an integer that's

938
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:28,259
string but an integer that's
 

939
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:30,769
string but an integer that's
incrementing and every time you push the

940
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:30,779
incrementing and every time you push the
 

941
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,570
incrementing and every time you push the
button it's kind of it's counting that

942
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:32,580
button it's kind of it's counting that
 

943
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,599
button it's kind of it's counting that
so when you push it twice it's going to

944
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:35,609
so when you push it twice it's going to
 

945
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,229
so when you push it twice it's going to
safely reboot the the raspberry pi now

946
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:39,239
safely reboot the the raspberry pi now
 

947
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,909
safely reboot the the raspberry pi now
know what's actually happening when you

948
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:40,919
know what's actually happening when you
 

949
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,479
know what's actually happening when you
push that button twice is that it's

950
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:44,489
push that button twice is that it's
 

951
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,289
push that button twice is that it's
running the OS system command reboot so

952
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:48,299
running the OS system command reboot so
 

953
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,239
running the OS system command reboot so
it's not doing a hard reboot is not

954
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:50,249
it's not doing a hard reboot is not
 

955
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:51,529
it's not doing a hard reboot is not
cutting power and then powering it back

956
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:51,539
cutting power and then powering it back
 

957
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,599
cutting power and then powering it back
on no it's actually running the reboot

958
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:53,609
on no it's actually running the reboot
 

959
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:54,950
on no it's actually running the reboot
command that I would run in my Vash

960
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
command that I would run in my Vash
 

961
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,009
command that I would run in my Vash
prompt so it's a safe reboot it's gonna

962
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:58,019
prompt so it's a safe reboot it's gonna
 

963
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,560
prompt so it's a safe reboot it's gonna
automatically sync your SSD it's gonna

964
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,570
automatically sync your SSD it's gonna
 

965
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,690
automatically sync your SSD it's gonna
save your files and whatever else that

966
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:02,700
save your files and whatever else that
 

967
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,369
save your files and whatever else that
it normally would do during a reboot

968
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:04,379
it normally would do during a reboot
 

969
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,589
it normally would do during a reboot
command you can also add your own stuff

this is going to be a Python script so

978
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:15,989
this is going to be a Python script so
 

979
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:19,489
this is going to be a Python script so
you could put any Python here any Python

980
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:19,499
you could put any Python here any Python
 

981
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,609
you could put any Python here any Python
and then just make sure that you pipe

982
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:22,619
and then just make sure that you pipe
 

983
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,149
and then just make sure that you pipe
that with not pipe but direct that to

984

1d dot pi so you can edit that script
and then you'll be able to change the

1002
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:54,479
and then you'll be able to change the
 

1003
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:56,180
and then you'll be able to change the
what it does when you push the power

1004
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,190
what it does when you push the power
 

1005
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,560
what it does when you push the power
button twice or when you hold it in for

1006
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:57,570
button twice or when you hold it in for
 

1007
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,190
button twice or when you hold it in for
three seconds and and you can make it

1008
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
three seconds and and you can make it
 

1009
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,930
three seconds and and you can make it
react the way you want maybe you want it

1010
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:02,940
react the way you want maybe you want it
 

1011
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,249
react the way you want maybe you want it
to send you an email or something like

1012
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:04,259
to send you an email or something like
 

1013
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,859
to send you an email or something like
that you can do that or you have

1014
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:06,869
that you can do that or you have
 

1015
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:09,229
that you can do that or you have
something else like a APC UPS that you

1016
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:09,239
something else like a APC UPS that you
 

1017
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,759
something else like a APC UPS that you
want to have safely turned off or

1018
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:10,769
want to have safely turned off or
 

1019
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,229
want to have safely turned off or
something after a 30-second time or I

1020
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:12,239
something after a 30-second time or I
 

1021
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,310
something after a 30-second time or I
don't know maybe you've got a watchdog

1022
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:13,320
don't know maybe you've got a watchdog
 

1023
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,889
don't know maybe you've got a watchdog
plugged into the GPIO you can use that

1024
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:15,899
plugged into the GPIO you can use that
 

1025
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:19,519
plugged into the GPIO you can use that
as well okay so if you push the button

1026
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:19,529
as well okay so if you push the button
 

1027
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:21,950
as well okay so if you push the button
for if you long

1028
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:21,960
for if you long
 

1029
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,039
for if you long
for three seconds it's going to run shut

1030
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:25,049
for three seconds it's going to run shut
 

1031
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:27,950
for three seconds it's going to run shut
down now - eh so that's actually a safe

1032
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:27,960
down now - eh so that's actually a safe
 

1033
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,619
down now - eh so that's actually a safe
shutdown command to power off your

1034
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:30,629
shutdown command to power off your
 

1035
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,029
shutdown command to power off your
computer so you're not just killing

1036
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:32,039
computer so you're not just killing
 

1037
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,430
computer so you're not just killing
power like you would if you continue to

1038
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:34,440
power like you would if you continue to
 

1039
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,109
power like you would if you continue to
hold in that button for five seconds

1040
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:36,119
hold in that button for five seconds
 

1041
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,999
hold in that button for five seconds
which is not a safe way to do it that's

1042
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:38,009
which is not a safe way to do it that's
 

1043
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,970
which is not a safe way to do it that's
like your last resort but this script is

1044
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:40,980
like your last resort but this script is
 

1045
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,460
like your last resort but this script is
as you can see running those commands as

1046
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:43,470
as you can see running those commands as
 

1047
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,220
as you can see running those commands as
you normally would safely so you push

1048
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,230
you normally would safely so you push
 

1049
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,200
you normally would safely so you push
that button and it triggers the GPIO and

1050
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,210
that button and it triggers the GPIO and
 

1051
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,970
that button and it triggers the GPIO and
it's monitoring how long you press it or

1052
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:49,980
it's monitoring how long you press it or
 

1053
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,289
it's monitoring how long you press it or
how many times you press it and then it

1054
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:51,299
how many times you press it and then it
 

1055
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,269
how many times you press it and then it
reacts accordingly so with a little

1056
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
reacts accordingly so with a little
 

1057
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,039
reacts accordingly so with a little
Python knowledge you could make that do

1058
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,049
Python knowledge you could make that do
 

1059
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:57,710
Python knowledge you could make that do
whatever you want if I push it three

1060
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:57,720
whatever you want if I push it three
 

1061
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,430
whatever you want if I push it three
times I want it to play my favorite song

1062
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:00,440
times I want it to play my favorite song
 

1063
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,999
times I want it to play my favorite song
that kind of stuff

1064
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:02,009
that kind of stuff
 

1065
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,499
that kind of stuff
whatever you think you can look through

1066
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:03,509
whatever you think you can look through
 

1067
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:07,310
whatever you think you can look through
here lots of fun so I love that as you

1068
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,320
here lots of fun so I love that as you
 

1069
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,350
here lots of fun so I love that as you
know people who like to look under the

1070
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
know people who like to look under the
 

1071
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,830
know people who like to look under the
hood we can do so and then when we're

1072
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:12,840
hood we can do so and then when we're
 

1073
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,539
hood we can do so and then when we're
done say we've made some changes we can

and then control X to exit and now I
 

1079
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,430
and then control X to exit and now I
just need to go chmod plus x are gone

one dot Sh and now I can run that by
 

1083
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:30,139
one dot Sh and now I can run that by
going dot slash argon one dot Sh

you guys hear that it's so quiet even at
 

1123
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,670
you guys hear that it's so quiet even at
on that's pretty good

1124
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:26,680
on that's pretty good
 

1125
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,550
on that's pretty good
please with that however because it is

1126
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:29,560
please with that however because it is
 

1127
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,200
please with that however because it is
controlled by an I squared C controller

rather than just a GPIO pin it's not

1130
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:38,590
rather than just a GPIO pin it's not
 

1131
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,040
rather than just a GPIO pin it's not
just on or off its you're able to set

1132
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,050
just on or off its you're able to set
 

1133
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,170
just on or off its you're able to set
the threshold so that's where we can run

1134
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,180
the threshold so that's where we can run
 

1135
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,820
the threshold so that's where we can run
that configuration script again and say

1136
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:44,830
that configuration script again and say
 

1137

that configuration script again and say
adjust to temperature so let's bring

1138
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:47,950
adjust to temperature so let's bring
 

1139
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,440
adjust to temperature so let's bring
that up on our screen a little bit I'm

1140
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,450
that up on our screen a little bit I'm
 

1141
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:56,150
that up on our screen a little bit I'm
having trouble seeing that on my screen

1143
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,100

okay so please provide fan speeds for

1144
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,110
okay so please provide fan speeds for
 

1145
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,470
okay so please provide fan speeds for
the following temperatures 55 C let's do

1146
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:03,480
the following temperatures 55 C let's do
 

1147
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,150
the following temperatures 55 C let's do
25% fan speed 60 C let's do 50% fan

1148
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,160
25% fan speed 60 C let's do 50% fan
 

1149
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,580
25% fan speed 60 C let's do 50% fan
speed 65 C all right 90% okay so now the

1150
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:14,590
speed 65 C all right 90% okay so now the
 

1151
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,740
speed 65 C all right 90% okay so now the
fan just shut right off because it is

1152
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:16,750
fan just shut right off because it is
 

1153
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,890
fan just shut right off because it is
using the passive cooling to keep that

1154
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:19,900
using the passive cooling to keep that
 

1155
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,000
using the passive cooling to keep that
thing below 55 I think it was so it's

1156
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,010
thing below 55 I think it was so it's
 

1157
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,670
thing below 55 I think it was so it's
completely silent if I start using my

1158
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:26,680
completely silent if I start using my
 

1159
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,570
completely silent if I start using my
Raspberry Pi to death it's going to spin

1160

up that fan alright so now that I've got

1162
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:33,550
up that fan alright so now that I've got
 

1163
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,100
up that fan alright so now that I've got
that script installed presumably if I

1164
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,110
that script installed presumably if I
 

1165
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,720
that script installed presumably if I
push the power button it's not going to

1166
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:36,730
push the power button it's not going to
 

1167
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,250
push the power button it's not going to
do anything nothing however if I push it

1168
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,260
do anything nothing however if I push it
 

1169
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,020
do anything nothing however if I push it
two times what's it going to do and

1170
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,030
two times what's it going to do and
 

1171
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,210
two times what's it going to do and
we're gonna lose the screen here but if

1172
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,220
we're gonna lose the screen here but if
 

1173
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,430
we're gonna lose the screen here but if
it works we know and there it goes

1174
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
it works we know and there it goes
 

1175
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
it works we know and there it goes
and now notice it's not killing the

1176
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:48,970
and now notice it's not killing the
 

1177
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,660
and now notice it's not killing the
power I don't know if you can see that

1178
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:51,670
power I don't know if you can see that
 

1179
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,540
power I don't know if you can see that
but it is actually done a safe reboot

1180
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:56,550
but it is actually done a safe reboot
 

1181
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,730
but it is actually done a safe reboot

this I love that I can still access the
 

1191
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,710
this I love that I can still access the
GPIO without having to take apart the

1192
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:13,720
GPIO without having to take apart the
 

1193
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,480
GPIO without having to take apart the
case that's cool

1194
