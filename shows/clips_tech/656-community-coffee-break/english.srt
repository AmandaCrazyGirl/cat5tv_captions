I know here no that wasn't the right one
 

781
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,779
I know here no that wasn't the right one
no call from Ireland was was the Phantom

782
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:51,789
no call from Ireland was was the Phantom
 

783
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:54,350
no call from Ireland was was the Phantom
here in Canada okay

784
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,360
here in Canada okay
 

785
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,060
here in Canada okay
talking a bit and I'm trying to find the

786
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,070
talking a bit and I'm trying to find the
 

787
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,720
talking a bit and I'm trying to find the
CD and I don't I just don't see it oh I

788
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:00,730
CD and I don't I just don't see it oh I
 

789
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,450
CD and I don't I just don't see it oh I
want to say Kevin or Brian or so but

790
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:03,460
want to say Kevin or Brian or so but
 

791
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,359
want to say Kevin or Brian or so but
it's like I can't think of it maybe I'll

792
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:06,369
it's like I can't think of it maybe I'll
 

793
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,460
it's like I can't think of it maybe I'll
switch around my camera and I can like

794
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:08,470
switch around my camera and I can like
 

795
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,720
switch around my camera and I can like
give you a little bit of a walkthrough

796
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,730
give you a little bit of a walkthrough
 

797
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,519
give you a little bit of a walkthrough
of what if I can okay so let's see I'm

798
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:14,529
of what if I can okay so let's see I'm
 

799
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,739
of what if I can okay so let's see I'm
really new it doesn't really do the Wow

800
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:16,749
really new it doesn't really do the Wow
 

801
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:21,330
really new it doesn't really do the Wow
okay here we so have you ever taken

802
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:21,340
okay here we so have you ever taken
 

803
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,549
okay here we so have you ever taken
carpet adhesive off of floor board it's

804
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
carpet adhesive off of floor board it's
 

805
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,440
carpet adhesive off of floor board it's
very difficult

806
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,450
very difficult
 

807
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,940
very difficult
yeah I've been using that's iron on

808
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:32,950
yeah I've been using that's iron on
 

809
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,509
yeah I've been using that's iron on
Steam and just steaming the bejeebies

810
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:36,519
Steam and just steaming the bejeebies
 

811
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,220
Steam and just steaming the bejeebies
out of that if I go to the other side of

812
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,230
out of that if I go to the other side of
 

813
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,560
out of that if I go to the other side of
the Attic obviously there's still like

814
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:43,570
the Attic obviously there's still like
 

815
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,299
the Attic obviously there's still like
lots of work that needs to be done up

816
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:45,309
lots of work that needs to be done up
 

817
00:20:45,309 --> 00:21:01,710
lots of work that needs to be done up
here my cat5 office is it insulated

818
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:01,720
here my cat5 office is it insulated
 

819
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,029
here my cat5 office is it insulated
don't mean what's it gonna be like in

820
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
don't mean what's it gonna be like in
 

821
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,960
don't mean what's it gonna be like in
the middle of summer

822
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:03,970
the middle of summer
 

823
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,570
the middle of summer
that'll be hot that's really stinking

824
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:06,580
that'll be hot that's really stinking
 

825
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,840
that'll be hot that's really stinking
hot right now no insulation in there

826
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:09,850
hot right now no insulation in there
 

827
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,090
hot right now no insulation in there
after none at all

828
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,100

 

829
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,960

yeah we're gonna have to ensure like

830
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:15,970
yeah we're gonna have to ensure like
 

831
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,669
yeah we're gonna have to ensure like
that whole area there so sure for that

832
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
that whole area there so sure for that
 

833
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,899
that whole area there so sure for that
to be viable yeah that is my washing

834
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:21,909
to be viable yeah that is my washing
 

835
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,180
to be viable yeah that is my washing
machine I this should be my office down

836
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,190
machine I this should be my office down
 

837
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,070
machine I this should be my office down
here yes you really need to make this

838
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
here yes you really need to make this
 

839
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,810
here yes you really need to make this
part of your part of this your office

840
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:27,820
part of your part of this your office
 

841
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,629
part of your part of this your office
it's far more suitable yeah I mean

842
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:30,639
it's far more suitable yeah I mean
 

843
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:34,499
it's far more suitable yeah I mean
they're real it is it will be a little

844
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:34,509
they're real it is it will be a little
 

845
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:40,950
they're real it is it will be a little
bit cooler yeah

846
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960

 

847
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,730

thirty-two degrees plus some yes what I

848
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:44,740
thirty-two degrees plus some yes what I
 

849
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,060
thirty-two degrees plus some yes what I
think we've decided on is making a

850
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,070
think we've decided on is making a
 

851
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,990
think we've decided on is making a
cluster of independent so a cluster as

852
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
cluster of independent so a cluster as
 

853
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,320
cluster of independent so a cluster as
in multiple devices but independent as

854
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,330
in multiple devices but independent as
 

855
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,380
in multiple devices but independent as
in each one will have its own distro

856
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,390
in each one will have its own distro
 

857
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:02,570
in each one will have its own distro
raspberry pi unit that will each have

858
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:02,580
raspberry pi unit that will each have
 

859
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,440
raspberry pi unit that will each have
the raspberry pi OS and zoom install and

860
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,450
the raspberry pi OS and zoom install and
 

861
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,139
the raspberry pi OS and zoom install and
each one of those has an HDMI output so

862
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:10,149
each one of those has an HDMI output so
 

863
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,950
each one of those has an HDMI output so
then each Raspberry Pi becomes a camera

864
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:13,960
then each Raspberry Pi becomes a camera
 

865
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,220
then each Raspberry Pi becomes a camera
source essentially for zoom so I'd have

866
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,230
source essentially for zoom so I'd have
 

867
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,250
source essentially for zoom so I'd have
one Raspberry Pi dedicated to Jeff and

868
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:20,260
one Raspberry Pi dedicated to Jeff and
 

869
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,529
one Raspberry Pi dedicated to Jeff and
that would be HDMI out into his capture

870
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:22,539
that would be HDMI out into his capture
 

871
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,299
that would be HDMI out into his capture
and then when I push the button on the

872
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:24,309
and then when I push the button on the
 

873
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,730
and then when I push the button on the
on the stream deck it would switch to

874
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:26,740
on the stream deck it would switch to
 

875
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,159
on the stream deck it would switch to
his camera basically and then have one

876
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:29,169
his camera basically and then have one
 

877
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,289
his camera basically and then have one
for sasha and one for Henry and however

878
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:31,299
for sasha and one for Henry and however
 

879
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,240
for sasha and one for Henry and however
we want to set it up so it's just like

880
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,250
we want to set it up so it's just like
 

881
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,980
we want to set it up so it's just like
one Raspberry Pi per person it might

882
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:37,990
one Raspberry Pi per person it might
 

883
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,519
one Raspberry Pi per person it might
work

884
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:38,529
work
 

885
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,740
work
so that's kind of where I'm sorry I

886
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:40,750
so that's kind of where I'm sorry I
 

887
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,570
so that's kind of where I'm sorry I
think I missed what it is you were

888
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:42,580
think I missed what it is you were
 

889
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,180
think I missed what it is you were
meaning to do with that raspberry pod

890
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,190
meaning to do with that raspberry pod
 

891
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,510
meaning to do with that raspberry pod
being able to have it have them come in

892
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:48,520
being able to have it have them come in
 

893
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,649
being able to have it have them come in
remotely through zoom ah I see okay

894
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:52,659
remotely through zoom ah I see okay
 

895
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,110
remotely through zoom ah I see okay
because for the show we obviously don't

896
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
because for the show we obviously don't
 

897
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,060
because for the show we obviously don't
want this grid layout and we can't have

898
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,070
want this grid layout and we can't have
 

899
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,860
want this grid layout and we can't have
it so that it's switching back and forth

900
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:58,870
it so that it's switching back and forth
 

901
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,320
it so that it's switching back and forth
every time someone speaks and okay no

902
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,330
every time someone speaks and okay no
 

903
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,450
every time someone speaks and okay no
you need a separate input for each of

904
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:03,460
you need a separate input for each of
 

905
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,070
you need a separate input for each of
them so you can edit them post as

906
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,080
them so you can edit them post as

live we need to be able to switch to the

910
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,370
live we need to be able to switch to the
 

911
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,180
live we need to be able to switch to the
person who's speaking manually and I and

912
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,190
person who's speaking manually and I and
 

913
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,899
person who's speaking manually and I and
and people may not realize but zoom

914

means the good camera that I use is out

920
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:22,929
means the good camera that I use is out
 

921
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:25,440
means the good camera that I use is out
of it basically is so during the

922

of it basically is so during the
 

923
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,060
of it basically is so during the
interview or during the conversation I

interview or during the conversation I
 

925
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,279
interview or during the conversation I
would be on my phone which would Bend

926

Wednesday we found that out when my pine

934
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:47,980
Wednesday we found that out when my pine
 

935
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,519
Wednesday we found that out when my pine
book probe would not work for the

936
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:50,529
book probe would not work for the
 

937
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,100
book probe would not work for the
feature and then so then signed off

938
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,110
feature and then so then signed off
 

939
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,790
feature and then so then signed off
rebooted

940
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:54,800
rebooted
 

941
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,650
rebooted
changed the way I connected things I

942
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:56,660
changed the way I connected things I
 

943
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,680
changed the way I connected things I
plugged the I plugged the Atomos ninja

944
00:23:59,680 --> 00:23:59,690
plugged the I plugged the Atomos ninja
 

945
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,450
plugged the I plugged the Atomos ninja
flame into the pine Book Pro and pushed

946
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:01,460
flame into the pine Book Pro and pushed
 

947
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,180
flame into the pine Book Pro and pushed
the cord mm-hmm worked flawlessly so

948
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,190
the cord mm-hmm worked flawlessly so
 

949
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,400
the cord mm-hmm worked flawlessly so
some and if not a half a dozen Raspberry

950
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,410
some and if not a half a dozen Raspberry
 

951
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,650
some and if not a half a dozen Raspberry
Pi for eight gigs yeah exactly so well I

952
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:11,660
Pi for eight gigs yeah exactly so well I
 

953
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,020
Pi for eight gigs yeah exactly so well I
think four would do it because four is

954
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,030
think four would do it because four is
 

955
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:20,080
think four would do it because four is
as many inputs as I have that oh yeah so

956
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,090
as many inputs as I have that oh yeah so
 

957
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,150
as many inputs as I have that oh yeah so
then we just basically that would allow

958
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,160
then we just basically that would allow
 

959
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,340
then we just basically that would allow
us to treat each person on their Zune

960
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:24,350
us to treat each person on their Zune
 

961
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,480
us to treat each person on their Zune
connection as a as a camera source so I

962
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,490
connection as a as a camera source so I
 

963
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,680
connection as a as a camera source so I
think that could work

964
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,690
think that could work
 

965
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,480
think that could work
and it's probably a pretty good way to

966
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,490
and it's probably a pretty good way to
 

967
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,730
and it's probably a pretty good way to
do it on the cheap on the cheap it's

968
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:33,740
do it on the cheap on the cheap it's
 

969
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,230
do it on the cheap on the cheap it's
going to cost like you know four

970
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,240
going to cost like you know four
 

971
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,790
going to cost like you know four

gotta buy the case I'm not even sure I'd
 

991
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,690
gotta buy the case I'm not even sure I'd
use a rough spot for that anymore I

yeah I really don't like and much menu

1010
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
yeah I really don't like and much menu
 

1011
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,410
yeah I really don't like and much menu
you've seen this too right

1012
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:35,420
you've seen this too right
 

1013
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,260
you've seen this too right
you've seen where the Raspberry Pi if it

1014
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,270
you've seen where the Raspberry Pi if it
 

1015
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,620
you've seen where the Raspberry Pi if it
loses power potentially that SD card

1016
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:41,630
loses power potentially that SD card
 

1017
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,230
loses power potentially that SD card
yeah it's corrupted you can't afford

1018
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,240
yeah it's corrupted you can't afford
 

1019
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,140
yeah it's corrupted you can't afford
that especially especially not live so

1020
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,150
that especially especially not live so
 

1021
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,080
that especially especially not live so
you know maybe maybe wants an option I

1022
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,090
you know maybe maybe wants an option I
 

1023
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,520
you know maybe maybe wants an option I
don't know what the price point is

1024
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,530
don't know what the price point is
 

1025
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,770
don't know what the price point is
though so maybe maybe just a bunch of a

1026
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:53,780
though so maybe maybe just a bunch of a
 

1027

1031
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,620
and this with the desktop yeah I like I
like what you're thinking and it's got

1032
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:02,630
like what you're thinking and it's got
 

1033
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,799
like what you're thinking and it's got
HDMI I was strictly thinking you know I

1034
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:05,809
HDMI I was strictly thinking you know I
 

1035
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:08,400
HDMI I was strictly thinking you know I
I just need a sec with

1036
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,410
I just need a sec with
 

1037
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,960
I just need a sec with
HDMI output but you're right it doesn't

1038
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:10,970
HDMI output but you're right it doesn't
 

1039
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,460
HDMI output but you're right it doesn't
have to be Raspberry Pi no you need for

1040
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:15,470
have to be Raspberry Pi no you need for
 

1041
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,710
have to be Raspberry Pi no you need for
it to work especially when you're alive

1042
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:17,720
it to work especially when you're alive
 

1043
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,049
it to work especially when you're alive
you can't afford to be having it break

1044
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:20,059
you can't afford to be having it break
 

1045
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:24,370
you can't afford to be having it break
down unexpectedly not just not to say

1046
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:24,380
down unexpectedly not just not to say
 

1047
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,970
down unexpectedly not just not to say
that they will but if you lose power all

1048
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:27,980
that they will but if you lose power all
 

1049
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,419
that they will but if you lose power all
of a sudden then but if you know why our

1050
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:31,429
of a sudden then but if you know why our
 

1051
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,020
of a sudden then but if you know why our
and the SD card corrupting is the least

1052
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,030
and the SD card corrupting is the least
 

1053
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:41,740
and the SD card corrupting is the least
of your problems if my UPS is so weak it

1054
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:41,750
of your problems if my UPS is so weak it
 

1055
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,440
of your problems if my UPS is so weak it
can't power for raspberry PI's I'm in

1056
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,450
can't power for raspberry PI's I'm in
 

1057
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,140
can't power for raspberry PI's I'm in
trouble because that are 510 is going

1058
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,150
trouble because that are 510 is going
 

1059
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,060
trouble because that are 510 is going
there we've got a Retina beeping at ups

1060
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,070
there we've got a Retina beeping at ups
 

1061
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,880
there we've got a Retina beeping at ups
don't you I do yeah I gotta get new

1062
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:51,890
don't you I do yeah I gotta get new
 

1063
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,370
don't you I do yeah I gotta get new
batteries and that thing well it's a

1064
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:54,380
batteries and that thing well it's a
 

1065
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,950
batteries and that thing well it's a
good point yeah I threw it out there in

1066
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:56,960
good point yeah I threw it out there in
 

1067
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,560
good point yeah I threw it out there in
case it would be you know yeah as a

1068
00:26:59,560 --> 00:26:59,570
case it would be you know yeah as a
 

1069
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,980
case it would be you know yeah as a
peasant option so yeah I like that idea

1070
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:02,990
peasant option so yeah I like that idea
 

1071
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,419
peasant option so yeah I like that idea
Xu fours or the new C for any of those

1072
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:07,429
Xu fours or the new C for any of those
 

1073
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,190
Xu fours or the new C for any of those
would probably do just fine it's really

1074
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
would probably do just fine it's really
 

1075
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,770
would probably do just fine it's really
just plugging them in and then seeing

1076
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:11,780
just plugging them in and then seeing
 

1077
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,020
just plugging them in and then seeing
how they how they operate with doing

1078
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,030
how they how they operate with doing
 

1079
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,240
how they how they operate with doing
