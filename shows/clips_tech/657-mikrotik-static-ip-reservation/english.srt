next in our microtic series is how to
 

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,710
next in our microtic series is how to
assign a static ip address

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
assign a static ip address
 

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,230
assign a static ip address
to a device in your dhcp in your dhcp

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
to a device in your dhcp in your dhcp

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,390
web fig here on my laptop
and i want to show you how easy this is

12
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
and i want to show you how easy this is
 

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,750
and i want to show you how easy this is
to do so

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
to do so
 

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,589
to do so
click on ip and click on dhcp

16
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
click on ip and click on dhcp
 

17
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,509
click on ip and click on dhcp
server and click on leases

18
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
server and click on leases
 

19
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,389
server and click on leases
this is an important thing to do because

20
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
this is an important thing to do because
 

21
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,830
this is an important thing to do because
you're you're going to need to have

22
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
you're you're going to need to have
 

23
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,790
you're you're going to need to have
static ip

24
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
static ip
 

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,870
static ip
addressing on your network for things

26
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
addressing on your network for things
 

27
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,310
addressing on your network for things
like servers

28
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
like servers
 

29
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,069
like servers
in my case we're also looking at pi hole

30
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
in my case we're also looking at pi hole
 

31
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,030
in my case we're also looking at pi hole
for example

32
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
for example
 

33
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,270
for example
so my pi hole server is in fact set as

34
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,280

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
so i'm just going to click on that
 

61
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,270
so i'm just going to click on that

00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
static but if i close that
 

75
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,950
static but if i close that
now you'll see 107 has that d next to it

76
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
now you'll see 107 has that d next to it
 

77
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,710
now you'll see 107 has that d next to it
and no longer is it dynamic

78
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
and no longer is it dynamic
 

79
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,710
and no longer is it dynamic
so now if i open it by single clicking

80
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
so now if i open it by single clicking
 

81
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,710
so now if i open it by single clicking
on it i get all these new options

82
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
on it i get all these new options
 

83
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,109
on it i get all these new options
and now i can assign it its own ip

84
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
and now i can assign it its own ip
 

85
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,190
and now i can assign it its own ip
address something that

86
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
address something that
 

87
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,190
address something that
is not currently in use on my pool so i

88
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
is not currently in use on my pool so i
 

89
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,590
is not currently in use on my pool so i
can assign that 2.88

90
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
can assign that 2.88
 

91
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,789
can assign that 2.88
and hit ok and now my pocophone

92
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
and hit ok and now my pocophone
 

93
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,550

107
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,550
who's asking shouldn't reserved ips be
outside of the dhcp pool's dynamic range

108
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
outside of the dhcp pool's dynamic range
 

109
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,589
outside of the dhcp pool's dynamic range
and while technically true in

you're not using dhcp

114
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
you're not using dhcp
 

115
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,589
you're not using dhcp
that's not the case here i'm going to

116
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
that's not the case here i'm going to
 

117
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,990
that's not the case here i'm going to
explain why so

118
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
explain why so
 

119
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,030
explain why so
traditionally us sysadmins are

120
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
traditionally us sysadmins are
 

121
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,710
traditionally us sysadmins are
basically it's it's ingrained in our

122
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
basically it's it's ingrained in our
 

123
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,350
basically it's it's ingrained in our
minds to always assign the dhc

124
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
minds to always assign the dhc
 

125
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,430
minds to always assign the dhc
uh the static address outside of the

126
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
uh the static address outside of the
 

127
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,830
uh the static address outside of the
pool the reason for that is

128
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
pool the reason for that is
 

129
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,910
pool the reason for that is
if you let's say you install a new

130
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
if you let's say you install a new
 

131
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,270
if you let's say you install a new
printer on a network

132
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
printer on a network
 

133
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,229
printer on a network
and you go to that printer and you type

134
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
and you go to that printer and you type
 

135
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:50,949
and you go to that printer and you type
in

136
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
in
 

137
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,430
in
the ip address and you put it within the

138
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
the ip address and you put it within the
 

139
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,309
the ip address and you put it within the
pool

140
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
pool
 

141
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,030
pool
now your dhcp server doesn't even know

142
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
now your dhcp server doesn't even know
 

143
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,990
now your dhcp server doesn't even know
that it exists

144
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
that it exists
 

145
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,509
that it exists
because it did not assign the ip address

146
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
because it did not assign the ip address
 

147
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,190
because it did not assign the ip address
so what we're doing here is completely

148
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
so what we're doing here is completely
 

149
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,390
so what we're doing here is completely
different what we're doing is we're

150
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
different what we're doing is we're
 

151
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,910
different what we're doing is we're
setting the reservation

152
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
setting the reservation
 

153
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,110
setting the reservation
in the dhcp server so that printer is

154
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
in the dhcp server so that printer is
 

155
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,509
in the dhcp server so that printer is
still

156
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
still
 

157
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,430
still
just getting the ip address from the

158
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
just getting the ip address from the
 

159
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,110
just getting the ip address from the
dhcp server

160
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
dhcp server
 

161
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,710
dhcp server
so does it have to be outside of the

162
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
so does it have to be outside of the
 

163
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,309
so does it have to be outside of the
pool now no

164
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
pool now no
 

165
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,149
pool now no
the reason it would have to be if i was

166
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
the reason it would have to be if i was
 

167
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,070
the reason it would have to be if i was
typing it in manually onto the printer

168
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
typing it in manually onto the printer
 

169
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,430
typing it in manually onto the printer
is because

170
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
is because
 

171
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,229
is because
when the dhcp server then assigns that

172
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
when the dhcp server then assigns that
 

173
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:24,710
when the dhcp server then assigns that
ip

174
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
ip
 

175
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,229
ip
address to another device on your

176
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
address to another device on your
 

177
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,390
address to another device on your
network it's going to cause an ip

178
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
network it's going to cause an ip
 

179
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,990
network it's going to cause an ip
collision conflict so you're going to

180
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
collision conflict so you're going to
 

181
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,430
collision conflict so you're going to
have two devices

182
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
have two devices
 

183
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,550
have two devices
sharing the same ip address and you're

184
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
sharing the same ip address and you're
 

185
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,229
sharing the same ip address and you're
going to get all kinds of like arp

186
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
going to get all kinds of like arp
 

187
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,430
going to get all kinds of like arp
attacks warning

188
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
attacks warning
 

189
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,350
attacks warning
arp attack warnings things like that

190
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
arp attack warnings things like that
 

191
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,030
arp attack warnings things like that
because you've got these collisions

192
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
because you've got these collisions
 

193
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,390
because you've got these collisions
occurring within your network things are

194
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
occurring within your network things are
 

195
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,149
occurring within your network things are
going to go slow all of a sudden

196
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
going to go slow all of a sudden
 

197
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,949
going to go slow all of a sudden
that's a problem because i am assigning

198
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
that's a problem because i am assigning
 

199
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,070
that's a problem because i am assigning
my ip address from the dhcp server to my

200
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
my ip address from the dhcp server to my
 

201
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,869
my ip address from the dhcp server to my
device

202
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
device
 

203
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,190
device
or to my printer i can set it to

204
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
or to my printer i can set it to
 

205
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,830
or to my printer i can set it to
anything that is not already assigned

206
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
anything that is not already assigned
 

207
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,550
anything that is not already assigned
and it will dish it out through the dhcp

208
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
and it will dish it out through the dhcp
 

209
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,670
and it will dish it out through the dhcp
and it doesn't matter whether it's

210
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
and it doesn't matter whether it's
 

211
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:19,110
and it doesn't matter whether it's
within the pool or not

212
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120

 

213
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
