so basically I'm saying I don't want to
use the DNS that's given to me by my ISP

158
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:51,640
use the DNS that's given to me by my ISP
 

159
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,170
use the DNS that's given to me by my ISP
and hit OK now when I go to when I go to

160
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,180
and hit OK now when I go to when I go to
 

161
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,910
and hit OK now when I go to when I go to
DNS you'll see now dynamic servers are

162
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
DNS you'll see now dynamic servers are
 

163
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,539
DNS you'll see now dynamic servers are
gone there's nothing there and

164
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:02,549
gone there's nothing there and
 

165
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,830
gone there's nothing there and
presumably unless it's cached if I try

166
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:04,840
presumably unless it's cached if I try
 

167
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,970
presumably unless it's cached if I try
to go somewhere it's just going to

168
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:05,980
to go somewhere it's just going to
 

169
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,979
to go somewhere it's just going to
timeout because right now I do not have

170
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:07,989
timeout because right now I do not have
 

171
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,759
timeout because right now I do not have
any DNS servers so now I need to add my

172
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:11,769
any DNS servers so now I need to add my
 

173
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,539
any DNS servers so now I need to add my
own

174
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:13,549
own
 

175
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:24,320
own
ten what 10.0.0.0 I done that's all

176
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,330
ten what 10.0.0.0 I done that's all
 

177
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,140
ten what 10.0.0.0 I done that's all
there is to it in a manner of speaking

178
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,150
there is to it in a manner of speaking
 

179
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,790
there is to it in a manner of speaking
but I'm going to reverse that so we've

180
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
but I'm going to reverse that so we've
 

181
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,589
but I'm going to reverse that so we've
gone through that process just to show

182
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:30,599
gone through that process just to show
 

183
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,600
gone through that process just to show
you I'm going to just kind of I'm gonna

184
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:32,610
you I'm going to just kind of I'm gonna
 

185
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,219
you I'm going to just kind of I'm gonna
reverse that so that I can show you a

186
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:34,229
reverse that so that I can show you a
 

187
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,370
reverse that so that I can show you a
demonstration of what we're actually

188
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:36,380
demonstration of what we're actually
 

189
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,510
demonstration of what we're actually
what we're performing here what we're

190
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520
what we're performing here what we're
 

191
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,270
what we're performing here what we're
actually achieving so let's turn back on

192
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
actually achieving so let's turn back on
 

193
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,390
actually achieving so let's turn back on
our pure DNS I have trouble with these

194
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
our pure DNS I have trouble with these
 

195
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,080
our pure DNS I have trouble with these
trackpads

196
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,090
trackpads
 

197
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,409
trackpads
I should get a mouse okay so see we're

198
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:48,419
I should get a mouse okay so see we're
 

199
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,390
I should get a mouse okay so see we're
back on the dynamic so I'm going to

200
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
back on the dynamic so I'm going to
 

201
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,129
back on the dynamic so I'm going to
bring up a website and you're gonna need

202
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:52,139
bring up a website and you're gonna need
 

203
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,779
bring up a website and you're gonna need
to do this within Firefox or Chrome

204
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:55,789
to do this within Firefox or Chrome
 

205
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,400
to do this within Firefox or Chrome
don't do it in brave because brave

206
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,410
don't do it in brave because brave
 

207
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,370
don't do it in brave because brave

advertisements don't do it in a browser

219
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,360
of doing what we're about to do by
revving through our pie hole so what I

220
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,370
revving through our pie hole so what I
 

221
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,610
revving through our pie hole so what I
want to do is go to HTTP colon slash

want to do is go to HTTP colon slash
 

223
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,620
want to do is go to HTTP colon slash
slash ads - blocker com and the reason I

224
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,630
slash ads - blocker com and the reason I
 

225
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,060
slash ads - blocker com and the reason I
want to go there is because it's just an

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,070
want to go there is because it's just an
 

227
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,939
want to go there is because it's just an
ad heavy demonstration web site so if

228
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:31,949
ad heavy demonstration web site so if
 

229
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,649
ad heavy demonstration web site so if
you scroll down a little ways you're

230
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:33,659
you scroll down a little ways you're
 

231
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,719
you scroll down a little ways you're
gonna start to see some advertising here

232
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:35,729
gonna start to see some advertising here
 

233
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,560
gonna start to see some advertising here
on this website there are ads that come

up on this site it looks like Firefox is

236
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:43,560
up on this site it looks like Firefox is
 

237
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,520
up on this site it looks like Firefox is
actually already blocking some and so

238
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:46,530
actually already blocking some and so
 

239
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,270
actually already blocking some and so
I'm going again you block origin request

240
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm going again you block origin request
 

241
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,980
I'm going again you block origin request
blocked 7 or 10% of this page can I turn

242
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:54,990
blocked 7 or 10% of this page can I turn
 

243
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,430
blocked 7 or 10% of this page can I turn
that off

244
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
that off
 

245
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,600
that off
is that what's doing it yeah now we're

246
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,610
is that what's doing it yeah now we're
 

247
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,810
is that what's doing it yeah now we're
gonna see ads there you go so Firefox is

248
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:05,820
gonna see ads there you go so Firefox is
 

249
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,629
gonna see ads there you go so Firefox is
now including an ad blocker that's cool

250
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:07,639
now including an ad blocker that's cool
 

251
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,939
now including an ad blocker that's cool
but understand so well if Firefox

252
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:10,949
but understand so well if Firefox
 

253
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,409
but understand so well if Firefox
already has an ad blocker why do we need

254
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
already has an ad blocker why do we need
 

255
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,999
already has an ad blocker why do we need
to go to all this work why do we need a

256
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,009
to go to all this work why do we need a
 

257
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,420
to go to all this work why do we need a
pie hole remember how I said this does

258
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:17,430
pie hole remember how I said this does
 

259
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,420
pie hole remember how I said this does
the ad blocking at the DNS level so and

260
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,430
the ad blocking at the DNS level so and
 

261
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,800
the ad blocking at the DNS level so and
I hinted to the fact that you're going

262
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,810
I hinted to the fact that you're going
 

263
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,120
I hinted to the fact that you're going
to reduce your bandwidth consumption

264
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,130
to reduce your bandwidth consumption
 

265
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,760
to reduce your bandwidth consumption
you're gonna speed up your internet and

266
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:24,770
you're gonna speed up your internet and
 

267
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,490
you're gonna speed up your internet and
that is because with something like an

268
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:27,500
that is because with something like an
 

269
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,200
that is because with something like an
ad blocking plugin

270
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,210
ad blocking plugin
 

271
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,070
ad blocking plugin
or an ad blocking browser traditionally

272
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,080
or an ad blocking browser traditionally
 

273
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,260
or an ad blocking browser traditionally
what happens is it still downloads the

274
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,270
what happens is it still downloads the
 

275
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,740
what happens is it still downloads the
ad it just hides it it blocks it but

276
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:38,750
ad it just hides it it blocks it but
 

277
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,110
ad it just hides it it blocks it but
with the DNS level blocking it's

278
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
with the DNS level blocking it's
 

279
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,540
with the DNS level blocking it's
actually the request to the ad servers

280
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:43,550
actually the request to the ad servers
 

281
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,409
actually the request to the ad servers
that respond with a null response so

282
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:47,419
that respond with a null response so
 

283
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,990
that respond with a null response so
it's actually blocking the ability for

284
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
it's actually blocking the ability for
 

285
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,869
it's actually blocking the ability for
your computer to reach the ad server at

286
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:52,879
your computer to reach the ad server at
 

287
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,119
your computer to reach the ad server at
all it can't download anything they

288
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:55,129
all it can't download anything they
 

289
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,950
all it can't download anything they
can't track you they can't trace that

290
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
can't track you they can't trace that
 

291
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,010
can't track you they can't trace that
request it doesn't matter there it's

292
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,020
request it doesn't matter there it's
 

293
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,719
request it doesn't matter there it's
going to be blocked at the DNS level so

294
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:01,729
going to be blocked at the DNS level so
 

295
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,610
going to be blocked at the DNS level so
there's so much more to it so now that

296
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:03,620
there's so much more to it so now that
 

297
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,439
there's so much more to it so now that
I've got this you block disable you can

298
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:05,449
I've got this you block disable you can
 

299
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,899
I've got this you block disable you can
see there's a Google ad right here okay

300
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:07,909
see there's a Google ad right here okay
 

301
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,080
see there's a Google ad right here okay
so back over to my micro tick here let's

302
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,090
so back over to my micro tick here let's
 

303
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,460
so back over to my micro tick here let's
again go to DHCP client under IP and

304
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,470
again go to DHCP client under IP and
 

305
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,290
again go to DHCP client under IP and
there are many ways to do this you can

306
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,300
there are many ways to do this you can
 

307
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,899
there are many ways to do this you can
do this on a network by network basis if

308
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:19,909
do this on a network by network basis if
 

309
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,159
do this on a network by network basis if
you want but I'm just going to do this

310
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:21,169
you want but I'm just going to do this
 

311
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,129
you want but I'm just going to do this
on my entire network because I want any

312
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:24,139
on my entire network because I want any
 

313
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,050
on my entire network because I want any
device that is on my network to go

314
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,060
device that is on my network to go
 

315
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,999
device that is on my network to go
through the piehole I can turn off use

316
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,009
through the piehole I can turn off use
 

317
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:33,420
through the piehole I can turn off use
pure DNS and hit ok now go to DNS and

318
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,430
pure DNS and hit ok now go to DNS and
 

319
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,360
pure DNS and hit ok now go to DNS and
add my piehole 10 dots

320
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,370
add my piehole 10 dots
 

321
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,170
add my piehole 10 dots
0.2 and this is all quite instantaneous

322
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:44,180
0.2 and this is all quite instantaneous
 

323
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,780
0.2 and this is all quite instantaneous
however there are a couple of things to

324
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:46,790
however there are a couple of things to
 

325
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,610
however there are a couple of things to
note so I'm going to clear my cache

326
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:48,620
note so I'm going to clear my cache
 

327
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,270
note so I'm going to clear my cache
this is DNS cache flush cache so now

328
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,280
this is DNS cache flush cache so now
 

329
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,219
this is DNS cache flush cache so now
anything that has already been accessed

330
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:54,229
anything that has already been accessed
 

331
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,590
anything that has already been accessed
is flushed out of the DNS cache and so

332
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:56,600
is flushed out of the DNS cache and so
 

333
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,310
is flushed out of the DNS cache and so
it's not going to be it's it's gonna

334
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,320
it's not going to be it's it's gonna
 

335
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,200
it's not going to be it's it's gonna
request to the game and go through the

336
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,210
request to the game and go through the
 

337
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,629
request to the game and go through the
piehole the other thing to keep in mind

338
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
piehole the other thing to keep in mind
 

339
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,990
piehole the other thing to keep in mind
is you could if you wanted to go into

340
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
is you could if you wanted to go into
 

341
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,460
is you could if you wanted to go into
DHCP server networks so instead of doing

342
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:12,470
DHCP server networks so instead of doing
 

343
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,400
DHCP server networks so instead of doing
this at DNS I could just say okay my LAN

344
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,410
this at DNS I could just say okay my LAN
 

345
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,270
this at DNS I could just say okay my LAN
or my these are my guest Wi-Fi networks

346
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
or my these are my guest Wi-Fi networks
 

347
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,439
or my these are my guest Wi-Fi networks
I could just add a specific DNS server

348
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:23,449
I could just add a specific DNS server
 

349
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,820
I could just add a specific DNS server
for those so I could do that see how

350
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:26,830
for those so I could do that see how
 

351
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,439
for those so I could do that see how
diverse the configuration can be with a

352
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,449
diverse the configuration can be with a
 

353
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,750
diverse the configuration can be with a
mikrotik so by doing it that way you

354
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:31,760
mikrotik so by doing it that way you
 

355
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,240
mikrotik so by doing it that way you
could have multiple pie holes with

356
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,250
could have multiple pie holes with
 

357
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,649
could have multiple pie holes with
multiple different settings you could

358
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:35,659
multiple different settings you could
 

359
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,740
multiple different settings you could
have a mum and dad Wi-Fi that has that

360
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:38,750
have a mum and dad Wi-Fi that has that
 

361
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,050
have a mum and dad Wi-Fi that has that
has direct access through like Google's

362
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,060
has direct access through like Google's
 

363
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,000
has direct access through like Google's
DNS or something like that if you don't

364
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,010
DNS or something like that if you don't
 

365
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,910
DNS or something like that if you don't
want to block things you can have your

366
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
want to block things you can have your
 

367
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,090
want to block things you can have your
guest Wi-Fi have a more hardened DNS

368
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,100
guest Wi-Fi have a more hardened DNS
 

369
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,190
guest Wi-Fi have a more hardened DNS
filter for example so you can do that at

370
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
filter for example so you can do that at
 

371
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,370
filter for example so you can do that at
a network level in my case as I say I'm

372
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:54,380
a network level in my case as I say I'm
 

373
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,560
a network level in my case as I say I'm
not doing it at this level I'm doing it

374
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:56,570
not doing it at this level I'm doing it
 

375
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,210
not doing it at this level I'm doing it
on my full network so my ether one is

376
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,220
on my full network so my ether one is
 

377
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,110
on my full network so my ether one is
gonna go through 10.0.0.0 love its DNS

378
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
gonna go through 10.0.0.0 love its DNS
 

379
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,190
gonna go through 10.0.0.0 love its DNS
requests so now if I jump over here and

380
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
requests so now if I jump over here and
 

381
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,960
requests so now if I jump over here and
just refresh this page as simple as that

382
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:13,970
just refresh this page as simple as that
 

383
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,540
just refresh this page as simple as that
the advertisement is blocked see that so

384
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:19,550
the advertisement is blocked see that so
 

385
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,900
the advertisement is blocked see that so
it tried to load it see how it's got a

386
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:22,910
it tried to load it see how it's got a
 

387
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,470
it tried to load it see how it's got a
placeholder it tried to access the ad

388
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,480
placeholder it tried to access the ad
 

389
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,210
placeholder it tried to access the ad
but it was blocked at the DNS level so

390
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:28,220
but it was blocked at the DNS level so
 

391
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,310
but it was blocked at the DNS level so
it never got to my browser how cool is

392
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,320
it never got to my browser how cool is
 

393
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,970
it never got to my browser how cool is
that so with this set up another thing

394
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:36,980
that so with this set up another thing
 

395
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,640
that so with this set up another thing
to keep in mind is that while your

396
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:39,650
to keep in mind is that while your
 

397
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,079
to keep in mind is that while your
mikrotik DHCP server is is going to dish

398
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:44,089
mikrotik DHCP server is is going to dish
 

399
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,920
mikrotik DHCP server is is going to dish
out this new DNS setting for 1000 - in

400
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:47,930
out this new DNS setting for 1000 - in
 

401
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,240
out this new DNS setting for 1000 - in
my case you may have a situation where

402
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,250
my case you may have a situation where
 

403
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,550
my case you may have a situation where
somebody has maybe accustomed

404
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
somebody has maybe accustomed
 

405
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,410
somebody has maybe accustomed
setting on their phone or maybe there is

406
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:58,420
setting on their phone or maybe there is
 

407
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,610
setting on their phone or maybe there is
there they're running a browser that

408
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:00,620
there they're running a browser that
 

409
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,910
there they're running a browser that
overrides your networks DNS settings

410
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
overrides your networks DNS settings
 

411
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,989
overrides your networks DNS settings
that could be a problem because this

412
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:07,999
that could be a problem because this
 

413
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,290
that could be a problem because this
setting is not enforced so this setting

414
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,300
setting is not enforced so this setting
 

415
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,030
setting is not enforced so this setting
can easily be bypassed by your device so

416
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,040
can easily be bypassed by your device so
 

417
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,819
can easily be bypassed by your device so
by default your mikrotik device right

418
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:18,829
by default your mikrotik device right
 

419
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,949
by default your mikrotik device right
now as I've just demonstrated with this

420
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
now as I've just demonstrated with this
 

421
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,269
now as I've just demonstrated with this
basic configuration is going to download

422
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:24,279
basic configuration is going to download
 

423
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,340
basic configuration is going to download
those settings through DHCP and I don't

424
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,350
those settings through DHCP and I don't
 

425
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,840
those settings through DHCP and I don't
know the download is the right term but

426
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:28,850
know the download is the right term but
 

427
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,509
know the download is the right term but
it's going to get the new IP and dns

428
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
it's going to get the new IP and dns
 

429
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,579
it's going to get the new IP and dns
settings from your DHCP server on the

430
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:33,589
settings from your DHCP server on the
 

431
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,989
settings from your DHCP server on the
Microtech but if your device has its own

432
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:37,999
Microtech but if your device has its own
 

433
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,749
Microtech but if your device has its own
custom settings it's going to circumvent

434
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:40,759
custom settings it's going to circumvent
 

435
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,920
custom settings it's going to circumvent
that so if you'd like to instead and

436
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:44,930
that so if you'd like to instead and
 

437
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,579
that so if you'd like to instead and
force it so that even if there was an

438
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:48,589
force it so that even if there was an
 

439
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,799
force it so that even if there was an
override on a device or if your browser

440
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:50,809
override on a device or if your browser
 

441
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:54,249
override on a device or if your browser
was ignoring your desired DNS settings

442
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:54,259
was ignoring your desired DNS settings
 

443
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,290
was ignoring your desired DNS settings
on your network well you'll want to

444
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:56,300
on your network well you'll want to
 

445
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,629
on your network well you'll want to
watch further in our series as we're

446
00:10:58,629 --> 00:10:58,639
watch further in our series as we're
 

447
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,549
watch further in our series as we're
gonna be looking at how to do what's

448
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:00,559
gonna be looking at how to do what's
 

449
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,030
gonna be looking at how to do what's
called DNS masquerading and with DNS

450
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,040
called DNS masquerading and with DNS
 

451
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,710
called DNS masquerading and with DNS
masquerading we're gonna take what we

452
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:05,720
masquerading we're gonna take what we
 

453
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,590
masquerading we're gonna take what we
learned today on this tutorial and we're

454
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:08,600
learned today on this tutorial and we're
 

455
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,720
learned today on this tutorial and we're
going to take it to the next level which

456
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:10,730
going to take it to the next level which
 

457
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,749
going to take it to the next level which
is to say okay my mikrotik is now going

458
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:13,759
is to say okay my mikrotik is now going
 

459
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,139
is to say okay my mikrotik is now going
to basically find any dns traffic that's

460
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:17,149
to basically find any dns traffic that's
 

461
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,720
to basically find any dns traffic that's
going through my network and it's going

462
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:19,730
going through my network and it's going
 

463
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,869
going through my network and it's going
to masquerade it so that it has to go

464
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:22,879
