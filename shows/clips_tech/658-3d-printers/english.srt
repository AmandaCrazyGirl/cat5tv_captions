my first bit attack that I'm curious

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:04,620
my first bit attack that I'm curious
 

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,869
my first bit attack that I'm curious
about right now and it's not something

4
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:05,879
about right now and it's not something
 

5
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,750
about right now and it's not something
that I have or can really get started

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:08,760
that I have or can really get started
 

7
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,150
that I have or can really get started
with is 3d printing

8
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,160
with is 3d printing
 

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,919
with is 3d printing
ah you see 3d printers to me have for

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:15,929
ah you see 3d printers to me have for
 

11
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,050
ah you see 3d printers to me have for
the longest time being this kind of

12
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,060
the longest time being this kind of
 

13
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,540
the longest time being this kind of
untouchable tech mm-hmm and I've looked

14
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:20,550
untouchable tech mm-hmm and I've looked
 

15
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,160
untouchable tech mm-hmm and I've looked
at them and I've kind of kept an eye on

16
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,170
at them and I've kind of kept an eye on
 

17
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,259
at them and I've kind of kept an eye on
them and wondered about them but it

18
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:24,269
them and wondered about them but it
 

19
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,290
them and wondered about them but it
seems so sci-fi to an old-school tech

20
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,300
seems so sci-fi to an old-school tech
 

21
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,720
seems so sci-fi to an old-school tech
guy like me to be able to 3d print tools

22
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:29,730
guy like me to be able to 3d print tools
 

23
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,759
guy like me to be able to 3d print tools
and 3d print things it just sounds like

24
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:31,769
and 3d print things it just sounds like
 

25
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,440
and 3d print things it just sounds like
something out of sci-fi from young we

26
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,450
something out of sci-fi from young we
 

27
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,750
something out of sci-fi from young we
were kids but it's a real tech now

28
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
were kids but it's a real tech now
 

29
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,610
were kids but it's a real tech now
and the price has come way down way down

30
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:40,620
and the price has come way down way down
 

31
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,470
and the price has come way down way down
to the point of unreasonable and I'll

32
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
to the point of unreasonable and I'll
 

33
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,569
to the point of unreasonable and I'll
talk about that a little bit but what

34
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:44,579
talk about that a little bit but what
 

35
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,880
talk about that a little bit but what
really has pushed me over the top is

36

really has pushed me over the top is
 

37
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,510
really has pushed me over the top is

seeing how some of my friends who are
 

39
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,470
seeing how some of my friends who are
into 3d printing technology are able to

40
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480
into 3d printing technology are able to
 

41
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,580
into 3d printing technology are able to
do just that come up with an idea and

42
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:00,590
do just that come up with an idea and
 

43
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,729
do just that come up with an idea and
realize it and manufacture it yeah and a

makeshift right and I can't get a

86
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
makeshift right and I can't get a
 

87
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,569
makeshift right and I can't get a
contractor in to build something and if

88
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:53,579
contractor in to build something and if
 

89
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,630
contractor in to build something and if
I did it's gonna cost 200 dollars if not

90
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
I did it's gonna cost 200 dollars if not
 

91

more just to have a proper conduit put

92
00:01:59,179 --> 00:01:59,189
more just to have a proper conduit put
 

93

in which is crazy when you think about

94
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:01,380
in which is crazy when you think about
 

95
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,130
in which is crazy when you think about
that it's it's a lot of money and so

96
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
that it's it's a lot of money and so
 

97
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,200
that it's it's a lot of money and so
Beau and I got talking about it and and

98
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,210
Beau and I got talking about it and and
 

99
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,139
Beau and I got talking about it and and
and working on some ideas and kind of

100
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,149
and working on some ideas and kind of
 

101
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,589
and working on some ideas and kind of
back and forth and he came up with a

102
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:12,599
back and forth and he came up with a
 

103
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,699
back and forth and he came up with a
design

104
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:13,709
design
 

105
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,410
design
for something that he's calling easy

106
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:15,420
for something that he's calling easy
 

107
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,649
for something that he's calling easy
portal and this is basically if you can

108
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:18,659
portal and this is basically if you can
 

109
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,349
portal and this is basically if you can
picture two pieces of pipe that are each

110
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:21,359
picture two pieces of pipe that are each
 

111
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,410
picture two pieces of pipe that are each
about this long and they screw into one

112
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:24,420
about this long and they screw into one
 

113
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,929
about this long and they screw into one
another okay but they have a flange on

114
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:26,939
another okay but they have a flange on
 

115
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,110
another okay but they have a flange on
both sides so with and he designed this

116
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,120
both sides so with and he designed this
 

117
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,670
both sides so with and he designed this
and he's actually printed one and I'm

118
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
and he's actually printed one and I'm
 

119
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,670
and he's actually printed one and I'm
and I'm hoping to receive one soon I

120
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:34,680
and I'm hoping to receive one soon I
 

121
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,059
and I'm hoping to receive one soon I
think it's in the mail but you put one

122
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:38,069
think it's in the mail but you put one
 

123
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,160
think it's in the mail but you put one
piece on one side one piece on the other

124
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,170
piece on one side one piece on the other
 

125
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,050
piece on one side one piece on the other
side and you know I guess I'll get

126
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,060
side and you know I guess I'll get
 

127
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,580
side and you know I guess I'll get
somebody on the other side to twist on

128
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:43,590
somebody on the other side to twist on
 

129
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,140
somebody on the other side to twist on
that side right and you twist it

130
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,150
that side right and you twist it
 

131
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,909
that side right and you twist it
together and it screws in together and

132
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:46,919
together and it screws in together and
 

133
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,159
together and it screws in together and
it sits flush and it's tight and it's a

it sits flush and it's tight and it's a
 

135
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,690
it sits flush and it's tight and it's a
perfect conduit with a nice little

Ameritrade calm and just do a quick

142
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:57,659
Ameritrade calm and just do a quick
 

143
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,800
Ameritrade calm and just do a quick
search for easy portal and and that to

144
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:00,810
search for easy portal and and that to
 

145
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,830
search for easy portal and and that to
me Jeff made me think okay so if I just

146
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
me Jeff made me think okay so if I just
 

147
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,289
me Jeff made me think okay so if I just
if I could do that instead of paying

148
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:06,299
if I could do that instead of paying
 

149
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,229
if I could do that instead of paying

portal something through the wall that
 

153
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,649
portal something through the wall that
starts to make a little bit of sense but

154
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:15,659
starts to make a little bit of sense but
 

155
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,899
starts to make a little bit of sense but
it's still beyond me it's still well

156
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:17,909
it's still beyond me it's still well
 

157
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,309
it's still beyond me it's still well
beyond me no he would have more of a a

158
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:21,319
beyond me no he would have more of a a
 

159
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,659
beyond me no he would have more of a a
robust 3d printer wouldn't be like a

160
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:23,669
robust 3d printer wouldn't be like a
 

161
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,000
robust 3d printer wouldn't be like a
little tabletop you know right well I

162
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,010
little tabletop you know right well I
 

163
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,289
little tabletop you know right well I
don't know I mean I asked him what kind

164
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:27,299
don't know I mean I asked him what kind
 

165
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,179
don't know I mean I asked him what kind
of printers he's using and he's got an

166
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:29,189
of printers he's using and he's got an
 

167
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,089
of printers he's using and he's got an
end or three okay he's got you know the

168
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:32,099
end or three okay he's got you know the
 

169
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,550
end or three okay he's got you know the
the standard kind of you know what we

170
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
the standard kind of you know what we
 

171
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,289
the standard kind of you know what we
would call a consumer 3d printer and

172
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:36,299
would call a consumer 3d printer and
 

173
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,689
would call a consumer 3d printer and
he's got he's got some that are a little

174
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:38,699
he's got he's got some that are a little
 

175
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,789
he's got he's got some that are a little
higher end as well hmm a little higher

176
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
higher end as well hmm a little higher
 

177
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,819
higher end as well hmm a little higher
end I was like no it's way higher end

178
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:43,829
end I was like no it's way higher end
 

179
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,589
end I was like no it's way higher end
yeah yeah I'm still learning the

180
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
yeah yeah I'm still learning the
 

181
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,249
yeah yeah I'm still learning the
industry prints human beings so and if

182
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:49,259
industry prints human beings so and if
 

183
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,379
industry prints human beings so and if
that's common well we could 3d print

184
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:51,389
that's common well we could 3d print
 

185
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,179
that's common well we could 3d print
body parts now yeah so here here's where

186
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:56,189
body parts now yeah so here here's where
 

187
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,119
body parts now yeah so here here's where
my thought processes go Jeff is I start

188
00:03:59,119 --> 00:03:59,129
my thought processes go Jeff is I start
 

189
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,099
my thought processes go Jeff is I start
to look at this wall and and so we need

190
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:01,109
to look at this wall and and so we need
 

191
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,710
to look at this wall and and so we need
to get the signage done right and so

192
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:03,720
to get the signage done right and so
 

193
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,149
to get the signage done right and so
I've got a signed person who's telling

194
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:05,159
I've got a signed person who's telling
 

195
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,219
I've got a signed person who's telling
me 300 dollars to do the sign so you can

196
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:07,229
me 300 dollars to do the sign so you can
 

197
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,379
me 300 dollars to do the sign so you can
think you can 3d print the cat5 logo I

198
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:09,389
think you can 3d print the cat5 logo I
 

199
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,869
think you can 3d print the cat5 logo I
start to think that I start to think

200
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:11,879
start to think that I start to think
 

201
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,050
start to think that I start to think
okay could I and then you start to look

202
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,060
okay could I and then you start to look
 

203
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,999
okay could I and then you start to look
at 3d printers and you realize that you

204
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:17,009
at 3d printers and you realize that you
 

205
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,349
at 3d printers and you realize that you
know for five hundred dollars you can

206
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:18,359
know for five hundred dollars you can
 

207
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,839
know for five hundred dollars you can
get a high end there like a decent

208
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:20,849
get a high end there like a decent
 

209
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,149
get a high end there like a decent
consumer 3d printer and that's on the

210
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:23,159
consumer 3d printer and that's on the
 

211
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,490
consumer 3d printer and that's on the
high end you can get them for 300 that's

212
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:25,500
high end you can get them for 300 that's
 

213
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,480
high end you can get them for 300 that's
true I

214
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,490
true I
 

215
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,790
true I
keep looking at them on ya different

216
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
keep looking at them on ya different
 

217
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,589
keep looking at them on ya different
online portals like Amazon and whatnot

218
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:30,599
online portals like Amazon and whatnot
 

219
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:36,740
online portals like Amazon and whatnot
and it's on my frivolous spending list

220
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:36,750
and it's on my frivolous spending list
 

221
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,370
and it's on my frivolous spending list
because is that's me too uh to me a like

222
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:40,380
because is that's me too uh to me a like
 

223
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,499
because is that's me too uh to me a like
a 3d printer I don't think I have a

224
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:42,509
a 3d printer I don't think I have a
 

225
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:45,140
a 3d printer I don't think I have a
legitimate need for at home actly but at

226
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,150
legitimate need for at home actly but at
 

227
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,499
legitimate need for at home actly but at
the same time I've thought about getting

228
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:48,509
the same time I've thought about getting
 

229
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,749
the same time I've thought about getting
a 3d printer for the sake of printing

230
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:50,759
a 3d printer for the sake of printing
 

231
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,839
a 3d printer for the sake of printing
LEGO pieces I don't know if that's even

232
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:53,849
LEGO pieces I don't know if that's even
 

233
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:56,420
LEGO pieces I don't know if that's even
a copyright thing probably but a lot of

234
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,430
a copyright thing probably but a lot of
 

235
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,909
a copyright thing probably but a lot of
times my seen them on Thingiverse but

236
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:58,919
times my seen them on Thingiverse but
 

237
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,550
times my seen them on Thingiverse but
yeah I mean my but like everyone so on

238
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,560
yeah I mean my but like everyone so on
 

239
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,680
yeah I mean my but like everyone so on
my kids will break a brick okay and it's

240
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:03,690
my kids will break a brick okay and it's
 

241
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,129
my kids will break a brick okay and it's
like and they cost a lot of money it's a

242
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:07,139
like and they cost a lot of money it's a
 

243
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,140
like and they cost a lot of money it's a
you know but if I could just print that

244
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,150
you know but if I could just print that
 

245
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,180
you know but if I could just print that
that you know that's a pretty basic use

246
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,190
that you know that's a pretty basic use
 

247
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,779
that you know that's a pretty basic use
case but for me I'm thinking like can I

248
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:14,789
case but for me I'm thinking like can I
 

249
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,770
case but for me I'm thinking like can I
offset expense mmm by printing something

250
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:18,780
offset expense mmm by printing something
 

251
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,460
offset expense mmm by printing something
myself can I justify the expense of a 3d

252
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,470
myself can I justify the expense of a 3d
 

253
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,499
myself can I justify the expense of a 3d
printer and learn and the time that it

254
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:24,509
printer and learn and the time that it
 

255
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,200
printer and learn and the time that it
takes to learn how to do it in such a

256
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,210
takes to learn how to do it in such a
 

257
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,749
takes to learn how to do it in such a
way that I'm actually saving money

258
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
way that I'm actually saving money
 

259
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,120
way that I'm actually saving money
that's the signage yeah it's to make it

260
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,130
that's the signage yeah it's to make it
 

261
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,310
that's the signage yeah it's to make it
look that way I bet you probably could

262
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
look that way I bet you probably could
 

263
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,850
look that way I bet you probably could
and now what okay for life me I'm

264
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:37,860
and now what okay for life me I'm
 

265
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,080
and now what okay for life me I'm
blanking on the name of the unit but

266
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,090
blanking on the name of the unit but
 

267
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,990
blanking on the name of the unit but
there's a tabletop 3d printer that I was

268
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
there's a tabletop 3d printer that I was
 

269
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,879
there's a tabletop 3d printer that I was
looking at there are so many Jeff well

270
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:43,889
looking at there are so many Jeff well
 

271
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,700
looking at there are so many Jeff well
these days they're easy but not only is

272
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:46,710
these days they're easy but not only is
 

273
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,480
these days they're easy but not only is
it a 3d printer it's also a laser

274
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,490
it a 3d printer it's also a laser
 

275
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,730
it a 3d printer it's also a laser
engraver yeah yeah I've seen though and

276
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:52,740
engraver yeah yeah I've seen though and
 

277
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,860
engraver yeah yeah I've seen though and
there was something else that did and I

278
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:54,870
there was something else that did and I
 

279
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,209
there was something else that did and I
was getting serious and I was loving

280
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:56,219
was getting serious and I was loving
 

281
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,999
was getting serious and I was loving
aren't those thousands it was it was 29

282
00:05:58,999 --> 00:05:59,009
aren't those thousands it was it was 29
 

283
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,740
aren't those thousands it was it was 29
yeah so and I was like oh I could come

284
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:03,750
yeah so and I was like oh I could come
 

285
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,439
yeah so and I was like oh I could come
up with something for that so maybe what

286
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:06,449
up with something for that so maybe what
 

287
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,450
up with something for that so maybe what
I what I would look at then in that case

288
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,460
I what I would look at then in that case
 

289
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,120
I what I would look at then in that case
is I would say okay would would I start

290
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,130
is I would say okay would would I start
 

291
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,459
is I would say okay would would I start
with something that's 300 and and see

292
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:13,469
with something that's 300 and and see
 

293
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:16,249
with something that's 300 and and see
how I do and see if I can offset cost

294
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:16,259
how I do and see if I can offset cost
 

295
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,800
how I do and see if I can offset cost
which is virtually making money and then

296
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:18,810
which is virtually making money and then
 

297
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,110
which is virtually making money and then
and then upgrade if I need to or if I

298
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
and then upgrade if I need to or if I
 

299
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,390
and then upgrade if I need to or if I
can justify that or I think you should

300
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,400
can justify that or I think you should
 

301
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,520
can justify that or I think you should
just say hey if somebody buys you that

302
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,530
just say hey if somebody buys you that
 

303
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,000
just say hey if somebody buys you that
unit you'll go through labor with me

304
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,010
unit you'll go through labor with me
 

305
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,570
unit you'll go through labor with me
[Laughter]

306
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:32,580
[Laughter]
 

307
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,560
[Laughter]
I know that's all on you Jeff

308
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:36,570
I know that's all on you Jeff
 

309
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,840
I know that's all on you Jeff
I looked at a 1u mounting system because

310
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:41,850
I looked at a 1u mounting system because
 

311
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,280
I looked at a 1u mounting system because
I want to rackmount some single board

312
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,290
I want to rackmount some single board
 

313
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,810
I want to rackmount some single board
computers right and you're looking a

314
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:44,820
computers right and you're looking a
 

315
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,370
computers right and you're looking a
couple hundred bucks yeah they're a

316
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,380
couple hundred bucks yeah they're a
 

317
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,140
couple hundred bucks yeah they're a
little server case to be able to put my

318
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,150
little server case to be able to put my
 

319
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,550
little server case to be able to put my
any single board computers on the server

320
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,560
any single board computers on the server
 

321
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,010
any single board computers on the server
rack and then I got onto Thingiverse and

322
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,020
rack and then I got onto Thingiverse and
 

323
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,440
rack and then I got onto Thingiverse and
I started looking and I could print one

324
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,450
I started looking and I could print one
 

325
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,220
I started looking and I could print one
mm-hmm so my approach has been so I

326
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,230
mm-hmm so my approach has been so I
 

327
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,110
mm-hmm so my approach has been so I
haven't bought a 3d printer I don't have

328
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
haven't bought a 3d printer I don't have
 

329
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,190
haven't bought a 3d printer I don't have
one but I decided okay I'm gonna see if

330
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,200
one but I decided okay I'm gonna see if
 

331
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,350
one but I decided okay I'm gonna see if
because this is this is what I fall into

332
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:06,360
because this is this is what I fall into
 

333
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,290
because this is this is what I fall into
I'll buy things thinking that oh yeah

334
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:09,300
I'll buy things thinking that oh yeah
 

335
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,790
I'll buy things thinking that oh yeah
I'm gonna use that I'm gonna it's gonna

336
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm gonna use that I'm gonna it's gonna
 

337
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,530
I'm gonna use that I'm gonna it's gonna
offset my cost and blah blah blah

338
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:12,540
offset my cost and blah blah blah
 

339
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,150
offset my cost and blah blah blah
but then I find that the learning curve

340
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
but then I find that the learning curve
 

341
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,220
but then I find that the learning curve
is too high so what I've been doing is

342
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,230
is too high so what I've been doing is
 

343
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,110
is too high so what I've been doing is
I've been going onto Tinkercad comm and

344
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,120
I've been going onto Tinkercad comm and
 

345
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,170
I've been going onto Tinkercad comm and
I've been doing my first designs uh-huh

346
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,180
I've been doing my first designs uh-huh
 

347
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,240
I've been doing my first designs uh-huh
and so I actually have four designs

348
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,250
and so I actually have four designs
 

349
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,280
and so I actually have four designs
already up including the category-five

350
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,290
already up including the category-five
 

351
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,060
already up including the category-five
logo Oh dice Oh on my I've got a thing a

versa count bald nerd mm-hmm so you can

354
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:31,800
versa count bald nerd mm-hmm so you can
 

355
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,680
versa count bald nerd mm-hmm so you can
see the designs including a little case

356
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:33,690
see the designs including a little case
 

357
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,390
see the designs including a little case
for a Raspberry Pi to be able to mount

358
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,400
for a Raspberry Pi to be able to mount
 

359
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,110
for a Raspberry Pi to be able to mount
it on my won-won you serve a rec 19-inch

360
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
it on my won-won you serve a rec 19-inch
 

361
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,930
it on my won-won you serve a rec 19-inch
server rack so so I'm doing the designs

362
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:41,940
server rack so so I'm doing the designs
 

363
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,750
server rack so so I'm doing the designs
first to see how how onerous it is I

364
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:44,760
first to see how how onerous it is I
 

365
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,630
first to see how how onerous it is I
figure out can I can I actually do this

366
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:47,640
figure out can I can I actually do this
 

367
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,210
figure out can I can I actually do this
and then I can start to look at okay if

368
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,220
and then I can start to look at okay if
 

369
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,770
and then I can start to look at okay if
the sign is going to be 300 how much

370
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:51,780
the sign is going to be 300 how much
 

371
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,870
the sign is going to be 300 how much
would it cost to print does it have that

372
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:53,880
would it cost to print does it have that
 

373
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,760
would it cost to print does it have that
kind of estimator online when you come

374
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:58,770
kind of estimator online when you come
 

375
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,420
kind of estimator online when you come
up yeah yeah okay in in the software you

376
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,430
up yeah yeah okay in in the software you
 

377
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,970
up yeah yeah okay in in the software you
can you can actually see how long it's

378
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:04,980
can you can actually see how long it's
 

379
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,780
can you can actually see how long it's
going to take and how much how much

380
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:07,790
going to take and how much how much
 

381
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,520
going to take and how much how much
filament it's going to use so there are

382
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:10,530
filament it's going to use so there are
 

383
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,920
filament it's going to use so there are
all those things so I'm starting to look

384
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:12,930
all those things so I'm starting to look
 

385
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,360
all those things so I'm starting to look
at that and I'm really really curious

386
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,370
at that and I'm really really curious
 

387
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,610
at that and I'm really really curious
and I'd love to know what you think and

388
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:16,620
and I'd love to know what you think and
 

389
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,130
and I'd love to know what you think and
you know is there a really valack are we

390
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,140
you know is there a really valack are we
 

391
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,870
you know is there a really valack are we
at that point where the prices come down

392
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:20,880
at that point where the prices come down
 

393
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,180
at that point where the prices come down
far enough on 3d printers that it now

394
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,190
far enough on 3d printers that it now
 

395
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,400
far enough on 3d printers that it now
makes sense to have one right in you

396
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,410
makes sense to have one right in you
 

397
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,860
makes sense to have one right in you
know in the home in the in the office

398
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:27,870
know in the home in the in the office
 

399
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,620
know in the home in the in the office
because you can do stuff now that is

400
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:30,630
because you can do stuff now that is
 

401
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,950
because you can do stuff now that is
like when I have ideas you can just 3d

402
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:33,960
like when I have ideas you can just 3d
 

403
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,660
like when I have ideas you can just 3d
print them right

404
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:35,670
print them right
 

405
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:40,700
print them right
I have ideas I have ideas comment below

406
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:40,710
I have ideas I have ideas comment below
 

407
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,890
I have ideas I have ideas comment below
what ideas do you have and what do you

408
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:42,900
what ideas do you have and what do you
 

409
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,960
what ideas do you have and what do you
think
