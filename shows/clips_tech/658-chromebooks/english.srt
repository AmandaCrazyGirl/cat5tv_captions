00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:26,970
so is it touchscreen like with your
 

61
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,580
so is it touchscreen like with your
finger it is a touch screen aqua with

62
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:28,590
finger it is a touch screen aqua with
 

63
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,910
finger it is a touch screen aqua with
Gorilla Glass and he absolutely loves it

64
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
Gorilla Glass and he absolutely loves it
 

65
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,120
Gorilla Glass and he absolutely loves it
and so because it is it is the

66
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,130
and so because it is it is the
 

67
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,859
and so because it is it is the
Chromebook you have access to the Google

68
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:36,869
Chromebook you have access to the Google
 

69
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,170
Chromebook you have access to the Google
Play Store and so all of his apps that

70
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,180
Play Store and so all of his apps that
 

71
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,340
Play Store and so all of his apps that
he's used through Google Play on his

72
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,350
he's used through Google Play on his
 

73
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,380
he's used through Google Play on his
phones he has access to but also because

74
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:42,390
phones he has access to but also because
 

75
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,999
phones he has access to but also because
of that it integrates with what the

76
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:44,009
of that it integrates with what the
 

77
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,170
of that it integrates with what the
school board does through the Google

78
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,180
school board does through the Google
 

79
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,670
school board does through the Google
Docs and yeah that's what I'm thinking

80
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
Docs and yeah that's what I'm thinking
 

81
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,490
Docs and yeah that's what I'm thinking
yeah so it's it's really was quite a

82
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,500
yeah so it's it's really was quite a
 

83
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,359
yeah so it's it's really was quite a
cost-effective option for a young child

84
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:53,369
cost-effective option for a young child
 

85
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,010

89
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,600
anymore he's no teenager yeah but but
for you know somebody who's learning

90
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,610
for you know somebody who's learning
 

91
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,139
for you know somebody who's learning
technology the responsibility of being

92
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:02,149
technology the responsibility of being
 

93
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,580
technology the responsibility of being
you know on their own device but in a

94
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,590
you know on their own device but in a
 

95
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,160
you know on their own device but in a
way that is safe and so that was one of

96
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,170
way that is safe and so that was one of
 

97
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,449
way that is safe and so that was one of
the key components as we needed

98
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:08,459
the key components as we needed
 

99
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,859
the key components as we needed
something that was safe that wasn't

100
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:09,869
something that was safe that wasn't
 

101
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,630
something that was safe that wasn't
gonna be you know I didn't want to have

102
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
gonna be you know I didn't want to have

stuff like that
 

107
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,259
stuff like that
obviously have to be start smart with

108
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:15,269
obviously have to be start smart with
 

109
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,640
obviously have to be start smart with

to do with the architecture within how

150
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:10,620
to do with the architecture within how
 

151
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,819
to do with the architecture within how
it done for OSS or the SOC no no it like

152
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:13,829
it done for OSS or the SOC no no it like
 

153
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,860
it done for OSS or the SOC no no it like
the like the the programming

154
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:15,870
the like the the programming
 

155
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,369
the like the the programming
architecture so it's not because

156
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:18,379
architecture so it's not because
 

157
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,500

13 so their Google account is provided
 

219
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,080
13 so their Google account is provided
by the education system so I have this

220
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,090
by the education system so I have this
 

221
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,420
by the education system so I have this
fear with if they started using a

222
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,430
fear with if they started using a
 

223
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,149
fear with if they started using a
Chromebook that when they graduate the

224
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:41,159
Chromebook that when they graduate the
 

225
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,040
Chromebook that when they graduate the
education system might shut down their

226
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,050
education system might shut down their
 

227
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,429
education system might shut down their
account and they lose like their files

228
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:46,439
