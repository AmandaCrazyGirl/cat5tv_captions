00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,160

do you guys notice these lights behind

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,170
do you guys notice these lights behind
 

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,820
do you guys notice these lights behind
us yes so they don't see the lights but

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:07,830
us yes so they don't see the lights but
 

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,530
us yes so they don't see the lights but
they see probably a little right so you

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:09,540
they see probably a little right so you
 

7
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,330
they see probably a little right so you
see the glow behind me and the glow

8
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:11,340
see the glow behind me and the glow
 

9
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,490
see the glow behind me and the glow
behind you hair

10
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:12,500
behind you hair
 

11
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,760
behind you hair
those are DMX lights not the rapper

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:17,770
those are DMX lights not the rapper
 

13
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,880
those are DMX lights not the rapper
[Laughter]

14
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:18,890
[Laughter]
 

15
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,130
[Laughter]
what's neat about so I've got we've got

16
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:22,140
what's neat about so I've got we've got
 

17
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,170
what's neat about so I've got we've got
LED lights all around us here at the

18
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,180
LED lights all around us here at the
 

19
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,620
LED lights all around us here at the
studio to illuminate us and Jeff you can

20
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:27,630
studio to illuminate us and Jeff you can
 

21
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,070
studio to illuminate us and Jeff you can
see them yep and they just plug in you

22
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,080
see them yep and they just plug in you
 

23
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,709
see them yep and they just plug in you
turn them on and they're significantly

24
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:33,719
turn them on and they're significantly
 

25
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,600
turn them on and they're significantly
smaller in size than the bulb lights

26
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:35,610
smaller in size than the bulb lights
 

27
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,270
smaller in size than the bulb lights
oh yeah now we've got all these soft

28
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
oh yeah now we've got all these soft
 

29
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,920
oh yeah now we've got all these soft
boxes that I got to sell because like

30
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:39,930
boxes that I got to sell because like
 

31
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,180
boxes that I got to sell because like
what do you do with them when you've got

32
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,190
what do you do with them when you've got
 

33
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,100
what do you do with them when you've got
all these nice little LEDs right but the

34
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,110
all these nice little LEDs right but the
 

35
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,170
all these nice little LEDs right but the
LED panels that we use are just plug and

36
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,180
LED panels that we use are just plug and
 

37
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,819
LED panels that we use are just plug and
play you plug in the power and turn it

38
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:46,829
play you plug in the power and turn it
 

39
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:47,590
play you plug in the power and turn it
on

40
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
on
 

41
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,479
on
DMX on the other hand gives us a whole

42
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:50,489
DMX on the other hand gives us a whole
 

43
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,150
DMX on the other hand gives us a whole
new realm for lighting in that you can

44
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
new realm for lighting in that you can
 

45
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,010
new realm for lighting in that you can
control all of the lights from a

46
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,020
control all of the lights from a
 

47
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,540
control all of the lights from a
controller okay

48
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:56,550
controller okay
 

49
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,939
controller okay
and when I say a controller so these

50
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:58,949
and when I say a controller so these
 

51
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,580
and when I say a controller so these
lights behind us are actually running

52
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:01,590
lights behind us are actually running
 

53
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,270
lights behind us are actually running
through oh my goodness what appears like

54
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
through oh my goodness what appears like
 

55
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,210
through oh my goodness what appears like
a mixer yeah right so like I can oh yeah

56
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,220
a mixer yeah right so like I can oh yeah
 

57
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,280
a mixer yeah right so like I can oh yeah
do do all kinds of changes we can I can

58
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,290
do do all kinds of changes we can I can
 

59
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,429
do do all kinds of changes we can I can
change the color so these are the this

60
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:16,439
change the color so these are the this
 

61
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,260
change the color so these are the this
is the RG oh that's the brightness and

62
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,270
is the RG oh that's the brightness and
 

63
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,890
is the RG oh that's the brightness and
then I've got red green blue yeah so I

64
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
then I've got red green blue yeah so I
 

65
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,330
then I've got red green blue yeah so I
can actually change that got a bit of a

66
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,340
can actually change that got a bit of a
 

67
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,380
can actually change that got a bit of a
purple going on so this is pretty neat

68
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,390
purple going on so this is pretty neat
 

69
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,219
purple going on so this is pretty neat
but again this is one of those

70
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:28,229
but again this is one of those
 

71
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,929
but again this is one of those
technologies that always thought it

72
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:29,939
technologies that always thought it
 

73
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,880
technologies that always thought it
would be ultra expensive but it was

74
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:31,890
would be ultra expensive but it was
 

75
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,890
would be ultra expensive but it was
pretty cheap so yeah they are very cheap

76
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:33,900
pretty cheap so yeah they are very cheap
 

77
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,740
pretty cheap so yeah they are very cheap
so but that blew my mind because I

78
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:36,750
so but that blew my mind because I
 

79
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,530
so but that blew my mind because I
needed to buy two lights for the studio

80
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,540
needed to buy two lights for the studio
 

81
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,670
needed to buy two lights for the studio
well this with eight lights was cheaper

82
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
well this with eight lights was cheaper
 

83
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,130
well this with eight lights was cheaper
than those two lights right that didn't

84
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,140
than those two lights right that didn't
 

85
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,020
than those two lights right that didn't
make any sense to me so then I but then

86
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,030
make any sense to me so then I but then
 

87
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,569
make any sense to me so then I but then
I started doing research and again I

88
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:49,579
I started doing research and again I
 

89
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,160
I started doing research and again I
start looking at how what can I do

90
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,170
start looking at how what can I do
 

91
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,350
start looking at how what can I do
that's kind of like tinker and and have

92
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,360
that's kind of like tinker and and have
 

93
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,060
that's kind of like tinker and and have
fun and I started looking at the other

94
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,070
fun and I started looking at the other
 

95
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,280
fun and I started looking at the other
lights that I have and well they are not

96
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,290
lights that I have and well they are not
 

97
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,600
lights that I have and well they are not
DMX compatible Oh however you can buy a

98
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,610
DMX compatible Oh however you can buy a
 

99
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,940
DMX compatible Oh however you can buy a
little controller that takes the power

100
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:04,950
little controller that takes the power
 

101
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,639
little controller that takes the power
and then takes DMX input and then

102
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:07,649
and then takes DMX input and then
 

103
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,999
and then takes DMX input and then
connects to any of the standard LEDs or

104
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,009
connects to any of the standard LEDs or
 

105
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,770
connects to any of the standard LEDs or
if you want to do like

106
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:12,780
if you want to do like
 

107
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,290
if you want to do like
tracks with the you know the spool of

108
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,300
tracks with the you know the spool of
 

109
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,930
tracks with the you know the spool of
light cable LED no so far me that's all

110
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:20,940
light cable LED no so far me that's all
 

111
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,140
light cable LED no so far me that's all
possible but then so again I'm looking

112
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,150
possible but then so again I'm looking
 

113
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,170
possible but then so again I'm looking
at okay well you know how can i what

114
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,180
at okay well you know how can i what
 

115
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,550
at okay well you know how can i what
else can I do with this is it worth

116
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
else can I do with this is it worth
 

117
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,990
else can I do with this is it worth
getting hmm there are DMX lights that

118
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,000
getting hmm there are DMX lights that
 

119
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,970
getting hmm there are DMX lights that
you've probably seen them that have a

120
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:34,980
you've probably seen them that have a
 

121
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,040
you've probably seen them that have a
pan and tilt feature yes so you've

122
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,050
pan and tilt feature yes so you've
 

123
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,150
pan and tilt feature yes so you've
probably seen them at dances and

124
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
probably seen them at dances and
 

125
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,070
probably seen them at dances and
everything else and with these lights

126
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
everything else and with these lights
 

127
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,580
everything else and with these lights
you can move the light around using that

128
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:43,590
you can move the light around using that
 

129
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,870
you can move the light around using that
controller okay then I got looking at a

130
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:47,880
controller okay then I got looking at a
 

131
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,220
controller okay then I got looking at a
particular very very cheap one and

132
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,230
particular very very cheap one and
 

133
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,449
particular very very cheap one and
realize that there are screws to remove

134
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:53,459
realize that there are screws to remove
 

135
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,750
realize that there are screws to remove
the faceplate why for service presumably

136
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
the faceplate why for service presumably
 

137
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,900
the faceplate why for service presumably
okay remember when I said look look

138
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:02,910
okay remember when I said look look
 

139
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,610
okay remember when I said look look
thinking about ways that I could use a

140
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:04,620
thinking about ways that I could use a
 

141
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,250
thinking about ways that I could use a
3d printer to do cool things that would

142
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,260
3d printer to do cool things that would
 

143
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,420
3d printer to do cool things that would
save money are you gonna make a

144
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,430
save money are you gonna make a
 

145
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,210
save money are you gonna make a
basketball no telling think about a pan

146
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,220
basketball no telling think about a pan
 

147
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,940
basketball no telling think about a pan
tilt zoom camera for $2000 yeah okay

148
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:13,950
tilt zoom camera for $2000 yeah okay
 

149
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,289
tilt zoom camera for $2000 yeah okay
then think about a pan and tilt light

150
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:18,299
then think about a pan and tilt light
 

151
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,530
then think about a pan and tilt light
that's controlled by this controller for

152
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,540
that's controlled by this controller for
 

153
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,060
that's controlled by this controller for
only $90 okay take the faceplate off put

154
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,070
only $90 okay take the faceplate off put
 

155
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,039
only $90 okay take the faceplate off put
a Raspberry Pi inside of it with the

156
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,049
a Raspberry Pi inside of it with the
 

157
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,030
a Raspberry Pi inside of it with the
Raspberry Pi HQ camera 3d print a new

158
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,040
Raspberry Pi HQ camera 3d print a new
 

159
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,030
Raspberry Pi HQ camera 3d print a new
faceplate to hold that in place now

I like that still think you should print

176
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:56,700
I like that still think you should print
 

177
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,170
I like that still think you should print
a bad symbol for there's nothing

so with with that controller you can

182
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
so with with that controller you can
 

183
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,699
so with with that controller you can
control as many like it'll do it has 196

control as many like it'll do it has 196
channels so you can control as many

186
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:09,660
channels so you can control as many
 

187
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,770
channels so you can control as many
lights and and pan/tilt systems as you

188
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:12,780
lights and and pan/tilt systems as you
 

189
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,199

virtually no limit for a small studio
 

193
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,050
virtually no limit for a small studio
like ours I wonder if at a

194
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,060
like ours I wonder if at a
 

195
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,390
like ours I wonder if at a
thinking from a pure like security

196
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,400
thinking from a pure like security
 

197
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,120
thinking from a pure like security
standpoint and if you could use that

198
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,130
standpoint and if you could use that
 

199
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,409
standpoint and if you could use that
housing to also hold like a wise cam so

200
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:30,419
housing to also hold like a wise cam so
 

201
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,140
housing to also hold like a wise cam so
that you've got your cameras inside yeah

202
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,150
that you've got your cameras inside yeah
 

203
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,930
that you've got your cameras inside yeah
the lights have multiple cameras yeah so

204
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:35,940
the lights have multiple cameras yeah so
 

205
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,150
the lights have multiple cameras yeah so
there's no reason why not that way you

206
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
there's no reason why not that way you
 

207
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,820
there's no reason why not that way you
can have your PTZ security as well going

208
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:40,830
can have your PTZ security as well going
 

209
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,650
can have your PTZ security as well going
on yeah sure

210
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:42,660
on yeah sure
 

211
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,230
on yeah sure
move it around well or you could just

212
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,240
move it around well or you could just
 

213
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,370
move it around well or you could just
buy a PT zy scam but in particular you

214
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:48,380
buy a PT zy scam but in particular you
 

215
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,080
buy a PT zy scam but in particular you
could use a real picture in particular
