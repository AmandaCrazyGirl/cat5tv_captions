1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:06,380

one of the tech that I'm looking at

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,390
one of the tech that I'm looking at
 

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,880
one of the tech that I'm looking at
right now actually in the middle of at

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:07,890
right now actually in the middle of at
 

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,749
right now actually in the middle of at
home is we've done away with our paid

6
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
home is we've done away with our paid
 

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,690
home is we've done away with our paid
minecraft server that we logged into

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:14,700
minecraft server that we logged into
 

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,029
minecraft server that we logged into
that the kids had access to and you know

10
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
that the kids had access to and you know
 

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,920
that the kids had access to and you know
like when I was traveling for work

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:18,930
like when I was traveling for work
 

13
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,840
like when I was traveling for work
yeah I'd be in a hotel room we log into

14
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:20,850
yeah I'd be in a hotel room we log into
 

15
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,099
yeah I'd be in a hotel room we log into
the server together and I'd be on the

16
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:22,109
the server together and I'd be on the
 

17
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,439
the server together and I'd be on the
phone with my kid and you know for like

18
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:24,449
phone with my kid and you know for like
 

19
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,330
phone with my kid and you know for like
an hour while I'm at home or while

20
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:26,340
an hour while I'm at home or while
 

21
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,130
an hour while I'm at home or while
they're at home and I'm in the hotel we

22
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,140
they're at home and I'm in the hotel we
 

23
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,269
they're at home and I'm in the hotel we
could play Minecraft together just that

24
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
could play Minecraft together just that
 

25
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,999
could play Minecraft together just that
I'll go Afghan acting remotely but I'm

26
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:32,009
I'll go Afghan acting remotely but I'm
 

27
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,030
I'll go Afghan acting remotely but I'm
using a Raspberry Pi to set up my own

28
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
using a Raspberry Pi to set up my own
 

29
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,910
using a Raspberry Pi to set up my own
at-home duel minecraft server one for

30
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
at-home duel minecraft server one for
 

31
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,450
at-home duel minecraft server one for
access through our pcs yeah and one for

32
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:44,460
access through our pcs yeah and one for
 

33
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,420
access through our pcs yeah and one for
Pocket Edition so the server is running

34
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,430
Pocket Edition so the server is running
 

35
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,049
Pocket Edition so the server is running
the software for both and once it's set

36
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,059
the software for both and once it's set
 

37
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,850
the software for both and once it's set
up no matter where we are we'll be able

38
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:52,860
up no matter where we are we'll be able
 

39
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,709
up no matter where we are we'll be able
to log into our home minecraft server

40
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
to log into our home minecraft server
 

41
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,709
to log into our home minecraft server
nice and have our own world and all the

42
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:57,719
nice and have our own world and all the
 

43
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,110
nice and have our own world and all the
kind of stuff but that way the kids have

44
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
kind of stuff but that way the kids have
 

45
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,439
kind of stuff but that way the kids have
full access to it they can have you know

46
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:03,449
full access to it they can have you know
 

47
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,660
full access to it they can have you know
give the login to their friends

48
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:05,670
give the login to their friends
 

49
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,730
give the login to their friends
it'll be behind those security features

50
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:07,740
it'll be behind those security features
 

51
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,859
it'll be behind those security features
of our network so it's safe and secure

52
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:09,869
of our network so it's safe and secure
 

53
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,469
of our network so it's safe and secure
that way but so you get to select who

54
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
that way but so you get to select who
 

55
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,480
that way but so you get to select who
joins the server right yeah but also

56
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,490
joins the server right yeah but also
 

57
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,399
joins the server right yeah but also
because it has the ability to do the

58
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:16,409
because it has the ability to do the
 

59
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,010
because it has the ability to do the
Pocket Edition server it means that on

60
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,020
Pocket Edition server it means that on
 

61
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,630
Pocket Edition server it means that on
their phones they can also stay

62
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
their phones they can also stay
 

63
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,570
their phones they can also stay
connected oh nice so now so that's what

64
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:23,580
connected oh nice so now so that's what
 

65
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,340
connected oh nice so now so that's what
I'm working on at home the the software

66
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,350
I'm working on at home the the software
 

67
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,109
I'm working on at home the the software
is installed I'm just configuring it

68
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
is installed I'm just configuring it
 

69
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,630
is installed I'm just configuring it
yeah I wasn't sure how it would run on

70
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,640
yeah I wasn't sure how it would run on
 

71
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,510
yeah I wasn't sure how it would run on
the Raspberry Pi because that's what

72
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,520
the Raspberry Pi because that's what
 

73
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,039
the Raspberry Pi because that's what
that's immediately what's coming to mind

74
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,049
that's immediately what's coming to mind
 

75
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,300
that's immediately what's coming to mind
because I'm like okay Raspberry Pi

76
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,310
because I'm like okay Raspberry Pi
 

77
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,399
because I'm like okay Raspberry Pi
unless you've got a four you're dealing

78
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:37,409
unless you've got a four you're dealing
 

79
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,270
unless you've got a four you're dealing
with one gig

80
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,280
with one gig
 

81
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,350
with one gig
no Ram it's a it's a three B+ and I

82
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
no Ram it's a it's a three B+ and I
 

83
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,139
no Ram it's a it's a three B+ and I
fought for sure it would be lagging yeah

84
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:45,149
fought for sure it would be lagging yeah
 

85
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,469
fought for sure it would be lagging yeah
but it's not what about world gen so if

86
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
but it's not what about world gen so if
 

87
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,530
but it's not what about world gen so if
you fly across the world is it is it I

88
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:51,540
you fly across the world is it is it I
 

89
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,450
you fly across the world is it is it I
haven't got I haven't gotten that far

90
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,460
haven't got I haven't gotten that far
 

91
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,020
haven't got I haven't gotten that far
yet okay so like I'm just I'm working

92
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,030
yet okay so like I'm just I'm working
 

93
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,580
yet okay so like I'm just I'm working
through the process of setting it up but

94
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:58,590
through the process of setting it up but
 

95
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,889
through the process of setting it up but
as far as running it on the on the PI

96
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:00,899
as far as running it on the on the PI
 

97
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,380
as far as running it on the on the PI
it runs okay there doesn't seem to be

98
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:03,390
it runs okay there doesn't seem to be
 

99
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,080
it runs okay there doesn't seem to be
any server lag with one of us joining

100
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,090
any server lag with one of us joining
 

101
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,199
any server lag with one of us joining
yeah it'll be you know the true test

102
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,209
yeah it'll be you know the true test
 

103
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,119
yeah it'll be you know the true test
will be when we add four five six people

104
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:11,129
will be when we add four five six people
 

105
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,520
will be when we add four five six people
oh yes

106
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,530
oh yes
 

107
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,980
oh yes
see how it goes but I was gonna do it

108
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:14,990
see how it goes but I was gonna do it
 

109
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,280
see how it goes but I was gonna do it
with my Audrey yeah that was an ex you

110
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,290
with my Audrey yeah that was an ex you
 

111
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,490
with my Audrey yeah that was an ex you
for yeah yeah yeah but I decided to give

112
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:21,500
for yeah yeah yeah but I decided to give
 

113
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,990
for yeah yeah yeah but I decided to give
it a try with the Raspberry Pi just

114
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,000
it a try with the Raspberry Pi just
 

115
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,510
it a try with the Raspberry Pi just
because of the the power usage yeah it's

116
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
because of the the power usage yeah it's
 

117
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,640
because of the the power usage yeah it's
a little bit lower and I had an extra PI

118
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:27,650
a little bit lower and I had an extra PI
 

119
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,560
a little bit lower and I had an extra PI
kick it around okay so yeah that's

120
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,570
kick it around okay so yeah that's
 

121
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,970
kick it around okay so yeah that's
that's the project that I'm working on

122
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:30,980
that's the project that I'm working on
 

123
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,010
that's the project that I'm working on
right now and and and if it works and it

124
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,020
right now and and and if it works and it
 

125
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,130
right now and and and if it works and it
runs well then maybe we'll do it as a

126
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,140
runs well then maybe we'll do it as a
 

127
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,210
runs well then maybe we'll do it as a
feature for the show that would be

128
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,220
feature for the show that would be
 

129
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,010
feature for the show that would be
awesome so PI 3b plus is limited to one

130
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,020
awesome so PI 3b plus is limited to one
 

131
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,070
awesome so PI 3b plus is limited to one
gig of ram versus an xu 4 which has two

132
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,080
gig of ram versus an xu 4 which has two
 

133
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,740
gig of ram versus an xu 4 which has two
gigs of ram right the 3b plus also is

134
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:47,750
gigs of ram right the 3b plus also is
 

135
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,990
gigs of ram right the 3b plus also is
limited to an SD card which is shared on

136
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
limited to an SD card which is shared on
 

137
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,910
limited to an SD card which is shared on
the USB bus so it's a little bit slow

138
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
the USB bus so it's a little bit slow
 

139
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,040
the USB bus so it's a little bit slow
yeah

140
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,050
yeah
 

141
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,290
yeah
whereas the xu 4 has the MMC yes so I

142
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:56,300
whereas the xu 4 has the MMC yes so I
 

143
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,080
whereas the xu 4 has the MMC yes so I
think if you have like a latent alike

144
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,090
think if you have like a latent alike
 

145
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,130
think if you have like a latent alike
not latency but issues with world gen I

146
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,140
not latency but issues with world gen I
 

147
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,110
not latency but issues with world gen I
think maybe the Xu form might resolve

148
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
think maybe the Xu form might resolve
 

149
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,290
think maybe the Xu form might resolve
that but also if you wanted to upgrade

150
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:08,300
that but also if you wanted to upgrade
 

151
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,830
that but also if you wanted to upgrade
to a PI for you can get up to 8 gigs of

152
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
to a PI for you can get up to 8 gigs of
 

153
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,710
to a PI for you can get up to 8 gigs of
ram I thought about that yeah see I just

154
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
ram I thought about that yeah see I just
 

155
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,539
ram I thought about that yeah see I just
