step up Oh droid x u 4x u 4 with 2 gigs

128
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,190
step up Oh droid x u 4x u 4 with 2 gigs
 

129
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,880
step up Oh droid x u 4x u 4 with 2 gigs
of ram with two the MMC are using SD I'm

130
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:37,890
of ram with two the MMC are using SD I'm
 

131
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,860
of ram with two the MMC are using SD I'm
using EMM see I've got a 64 gig emmc on

132
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:42,870
using EMM see I've got a 64 gig emmc on
 

133
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,630
using EMM see I've got a 64 gig emmc on
there you know which is way more than I

134
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
there you know which is way more than I
 

135
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,610
there you know which is way more than I
need for the server you say that but

136
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:46,620
need for the server you say that but
 

137
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,650
need for the server you say that but
then your kids become master builder

138
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:48,660
then your kids become master builder
 

139
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,690
then your kids become master builder
well exactly and that's why I went with

140
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:50,700
well exactly and that's why I went with
 

141
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,400
well exactly and that's why I went with
a bigger one I debated on the 128 but

142
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,410
a bigger one I debated on the 128 but
 

143
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,210
a bigger one I debated on the 128 but
I'm like I think that's a bit of

144
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm like I think that's a bit of
 

145
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,380
I'm like I think that's a bit of
overkill right now for minecraft server

146
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,390
overkill right now for minecraft server
 

147
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,830
overkill right now for minecraft server
but I so the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ was too

148
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
but I so the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ was too
 

149
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,520
but I so the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ was too
slow

150
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,530
slow
 

151
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,210
slow
going beyond multiple a single user and

152
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:02,220
going beyond multiple a single user and
 

153
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,710
going beyond multiple a single user and
I think even if it was speedy enough to

154
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
I think even if it was speedy enough to
 

155
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,170
I think even if it was speedy enough to
run multiple users by the time they

156
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,180
run multiple users by the time they
 

157
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,940
run multiple users by the time they
start creating and building and all that

158
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:10,950
start creating and building and all that
 

159
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,410
start creating and building and all that
it would slow right down so now I'm

160
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:12,420
it would slow right down so now I'm
 

161
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,550
it would slow right down so now I'm
trying it on the Xtreme I guess that

162
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:13,560
trying it on the Xtreme I guess that
 

163
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,430
trying it on the Xtreme I guess that
world gen yeah it's on Raspberry Pi and

164
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:16,440
world gen yeah it's on Raspberry Pi and
 

165
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,170
world gen yeah it's on Raspberry Pi and
we'll see how that goes well you don't

166
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,180
we'll see how that goes well you don't
 

167
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,590
we'll see how that goes well you don't
have an update for us yet no oh darn it

168
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
have an update for us yet no oh darn it
 

169
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,040
have an update for us yet no oh darn it
Jeff what are these like an old water so

170
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,050
Jeff what are these like an old water so
 

171
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,790
Jeff what are these like an old water so
much I gosh dude so I've got install I

172
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
much I gosh dude so I've got install I
 

173
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,740
much I gosh dude so I've got install I
just haven't done the the test yet

174
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,750
just haven't done the the test yet
 

175
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,110
just haven't done the the test yet
you're gonna fill us in on this yes of

176
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
you're gonna fill us in on this yes of
 

177
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,940
you're gonna fill us in on this yes of
course goodness and and if if the xu4 is

178
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:37,950
course goodness and and if if the xu4 is
 

179
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,090
course goodness and and if if the xu4 is
a little bit slow then I will go with

180
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100
a little bit slow then I will go with
 

181
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,270
a little bit slow then I will go with
the Raspberry Pi

182
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,280
the Raspberry Pi
 

183
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,060
the Raspberry Pi
here is what is nice about going with

184
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,070
here is what is nice about going with
 

185
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,610
here is what is nice about going with
the Raspberry Pi for you've already

186
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:47,620
the Raspberry Pi for you've already
 

187
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,040
the Raspberry Pi for you've already
created it for the Raspberry Pi 3 B+

188
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,050
created it for the Raspberry Pi 3 B+
 

189
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,790
created it for the Raspberry Pi 3 B+
correct so all you have to do is take

190
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:53,800
correct so all you have to do is take
 

191
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,090
correct so all you have to do is take
the SD card out of the three B+ pop it

192
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,100
the SD card out of the three B+ pop it
 

193
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,040
the SD card out of the three B+ pop it
in a Raspberry Pi four that's right and

194
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,050
in a Raspberry Pi four that's right and
 

195
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,790
in a Raspberry Pi four that's right and
turn it on

196
00:04:59,790 --> 00:04:59,800
turn it on
 

197
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,560
turn it on
that's right because it's already I

198
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,570
that's right because it's already I
 

199
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,820
that's right because it's already I
figured is beautiful

200
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:02,830
figured is beautiful
 

201
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,860
figured is beautiful
yes that's what Raspberry Pi has going

202
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:04,870
yes that's what Raspberry Pi has going
 

203
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,440
yes that's what Raspberry Pi has going
for it is that it is forward compatible

204
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,450
for it is that it is forward compatible
 

205
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,330
for it is that it is forward compatible
it's not backward compatible if it like

206
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:09,340
it's not backward compatible if it like
 

207
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,570
it's not backward compatible if it like
you have to a well not backward

208
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:12,580
you have to a well not backward
 

209
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,310
you have to a well not backward
compatible no that's not right

210
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
compatible no that's not right
 

211
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
compatible no that's not right
what I mean is that an old distro from a

212
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,250
what I mean is that an old distro from a
 

213
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,580
what I mean is that an old distro from a
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ will not work on a new

214
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:20,590
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ will not work on a new
 

215
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,290
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ will not work on a new
Raspberry Pi 4 because they changed the

216
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,300
Raspberry Pi 4 because they changed the
 

217
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,890
Raspberry Pi 4 because they changed the
bootloader yes however as long as you do

218
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:25,900
bootloader yes however as long as you do
 

219
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,080
bootloader yes however as long as you do
like an well I presume it's a new

220
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,090
like an well I presume it's a new
 

221
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,200
like an well I presume it's a new
version of Raspberry Pi os yes yeah it

222
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,210
version of Raspberry Pi os yes yeah it
 

223
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,060
version of Raspberry Pi os yes yeah it
was the most rigid so it's going to work

224
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,070
was the most rigid so it's going to work
 

225
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,430
was the most rigid so it's going to work
on a Raspberry Pi 4 or a Raspberry Pi 0

226
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
on a Raspberry Pi 4 or a Raspberry Pi 0
 

227
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,490
on a Raspberry Pi 4 or a Raspberry Pi 0
whatever but the performance will be

228
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:38,500
whatever but the performance will be
 

229
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,310
whatever but the performance will be
impacted if you have a distro that's

230
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,320
impacted if you have a distro that's
 

231
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,469
impacted if you have a distro that's
been built on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that's

232
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:43,479
been built on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that's
 

233
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,650
been built on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that's
not compatible with a raspberry pi 4 you

234
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:46,660
not compatible with a raspberry pi 4 you
 

235
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,810
not compatible with a raspberry pi 4 you
can do a dist upgrade exactly and that

236
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:48,820
can do a dist upgrade exactly and that
 

237
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,969
can do a dist upgrade exactly and that
will actually make it compatible with

238
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:50,979
will actually make it compatible with
 

239
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,130
will actually make it compatible with
the Raspberry Pi do ya apt update and

240
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,140
the Raspberry Pi do ya apt update and
 

241
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,730
the Raspberry Pi do ya apt update and
then enter and then apt upgrade and then

242
00:05:59,730 --> 00:05:59,740
then enter and then apt upgrade and then
 

243
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,140
then enter and then apt upgrade and then
enter and then apt dist - upgrade and

244
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,150
enter and then apt dist - upgrade and
 

245
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,029
enter and then apt dist - upgrade and
that's all you need to do on a Raspberry

246
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:06,039
that's all you need to do on a Raspberry
 

247
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,580
that's all you need to do on a Raspberry
Pi 3 or 0 don't paint anything in

248
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:08,590
Pi 3 or 0 don't paint anything in
 

249
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,590
Pi 3 or 0 don't paint anything in
between in order to make it compatible

250
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:10,600
between in order to make it compatible
 

251
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,409
between in order to make it compatible
with a Raspberry Pi floor so you can

252
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:13,419
with a Raspberry Pi floor so you can
 

253
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,390
with a Raspberry Pi floor so you can
take that SD card and move it into

254
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:15,400
take that SD card and move it into
 

255
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,450
take that SD card and move it into
another into a faster system you cannot

256
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,460
another into a faster system you cannot
 

257
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,880
another into a faster system you cannot
take that SD card out of the Raspberry

258
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:20,890
take that SD card out of the Raspberry
 

259
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,550
take that SD card out of the Raspberry
Pi 3 and plug it into an X you for from

260
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:23,560
Pi 3 and plug it into an X you for from
 

261
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,770
Pi 3 and plug it into an X you for from
override because they are not compatible

262
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:25,780
override because they are not compatible
 

263
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,830
override because they are not compatible
right yeah but the Odroid has twice as

264
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:28,840
right yeah but the Odroid has twice as
 

265
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,000
right yeah but the Odroid has twice as
much RAM mm-hmm way more storage

266
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,010
much RAM mm-hmm way more storage
 

267
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,460
much RAM mm-hmm way more storage
MMC is so much faster than SD cards

268
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:35,470
MMC is so much faster than SD cards
 

269
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,090
MMC is so much faster than SD cards
especially on the pre PI 4 yeah because

270
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,100
especially on the pre PI 4 yeah because
 

271
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,520
especially on the pre PI 4 yeah because
those were really slow SD card readers

272
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,530
those were really slow SD card readers
 

273
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,310
those were really slow SD card readers
and the reason I went with if I what if

274
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,320
and the reason I went with if I what if
 

275
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,370
and the reason I went with if I what if
I had a Raspberry Pi for yeah one of you

276
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:47,380
I had a Raspberry Pi for yeah one of you
 

277
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,750
I had a Raspberry Pi for yeah one of you
I would just would have gone from the 3

278
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:48,760
I would just would have gone from the 3
 

279
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,909
I would just would have gone from the 3
to the 4 but because I have not

280
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:50,919
to the 4 but because I have not
 

281
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,520
to the 4 but because I have not
purchased a Raspberry Pi for yet the

282
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:53,530
purchased a Raspberry Pi for yet the
 

283
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,260
purchased a Raspberry Pi for yet the
extra 4 is what I had and so that's why

284
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,270
extra 4 is what I had and so that's why
 

285
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,050
extra 4 is what I had and so that's why
I'm giving it

286
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,060
I'm giving it
 

287
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,540
I'm giving it
that wonderful as I was doing anything

288
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:58,550
that wonderful as I was doing anything
 

289
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,250
that wonderful as I was doing anything
I've thought about our conversation last

290
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,260
I've thought about our conversation last
 

291
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,420
I've thought about our conversation last
week you like all what about they were

292
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,430
week you like all what about they were
 

293
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,400
week you like all what about they were
dry and what about the you know and so

294
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,410
dry and what about the you know and so
 

295
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,960
dry and what about the you know and so
I'm like here here's the progression on

296
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:04,970
I'm like here here's the progression on
 

297
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,060
I'm like here here's the progression on
we're so we can you know I'll be able to

298
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,070
we're so we can you know I'll be able to
 

299
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,890
we're so we can you know I'll be able to
report back and say this was the

300
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:08,900
report back and say this was the
 

301
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,110
report back and say this was the
difference now I I should have fought to

302
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
difference now I I should have fought to
 

303
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,630
difference now I I should have fought to
do like benchmarks and stuff between the

304
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:13,640
do like benchmarks and stuff between the
 

305
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,320
do like benchmarks and stuff between the
two but yeah but you know yo you can

306
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,330
two but yeah but you know yo you can
 

307
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,000
two but yeah but you know yo you can
tell when you're playing minecraft if

308
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,010
tell when you're playing minecraft if
 

309
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,630
tell when you're playing minecraft if
world gen is bad yes yeah so Jeff on

310
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:22,640
world gen is bad yes yeah so Jeff on
 

311
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,530
