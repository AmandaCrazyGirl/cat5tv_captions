what i wanted to show you

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
what i wanted to show you
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,470
what i wanted to show you
is simply a clock that i've been working

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
is simply a clock that i've been working
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,310
is simply a clock that i've been working
on i know that sounds crazy but

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
on i know that sounds crazy but
 

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,190
on i know that sounds crazy but
one of the things that i've been trying

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
one of the things that i've been trying
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,990
one of the things that i've been trying
to achieve

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
to achieve
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,310
to achieve
with this space which is our basically

12
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
with this space which is our basically
 

13
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,829
with this space which is our basically
our producers room

14
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
our producers room
 

15
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,310
our producers room
is to make it as functional as possible

16
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
is to make it as functional as possible
 

17
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,470
is to make it as functional as possible
but also try to give it some eye candy

18
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
but also try to give it some eye candy
 

19
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,189
but also try to give it some eye candy
as well

20
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
as well
 

21
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,990
as well
i've been using just a standard analog

22
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
i've been using just a standard analog
 

23
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,230
i've been using just a standard analog
clock on the wall because it has

24
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
clock on the wall because it has
 

25
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,349
clock on the wall because it has
tick tick tick tick and i can count the

26
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
tick tick tick tick and i can count the
 

27
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,669
tick tick tick tick and i can count the
seconds but i wanted to take it one more

28
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
seconds but i wanted to take it one more
 

29
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,990
seconds but i wanted to take it one more
like a step further because quite often

30
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
like a step further because quite often
 

31
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,670
like a step further because quite often
when we're producing video especially

32
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
when we're producing video especially
 

33
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,549
when we're producing video especially
live

34
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
live
 

35
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,790
live
we have to meet markers so there's a

36
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
we have to meet markers so there's a
 

37
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,470
we have to meet markers so there's a
countdown

38
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
countdown
 

39
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,790
countdown
usually i have a walkie-talkie if i'm

40
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
usually i have a walkie-talkie if i'm
 

41
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,990
usually i have a walkie-talkie if i'm
producing somebody in the other

42
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
producing somebody in the other
 

43
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,630
producing somebody in the other
room and i'll be communicating back and

44
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
room and i'll be communicating back and
 

45
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,190
room and i'll be communicating back and
forth

46
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
forth
 

47
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,510
forth
in order to let them know the countdown

48
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
in order to let them know the countdown
 

49
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,590
in order to let them know the countdown
so you've seen it on tv i'm sure so

50
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
so you've seen it on tv i'm sure so
 

51
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,110
so you've seen it on tv i'm sure so
you know five seconds three

52
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
you know five seconds three
 

53
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,029
you know five seconds three
mark you know so we're punching in that

54
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
mark you know so we're punching in that
 

55
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,430
mark you know so we're punching in that
way but it's not always ideal to use

56
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
way but it's not always ideal to use
 

57
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,349
way but it's not always ideal to use
just a standard clock

58
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
just a standard clock
 

59
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,670
just a standard clock
so i set out to build something a little

60
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
so i set out to build something a little
 

61
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,189
so i set out to build something a little
bit different and it's powered

62
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
bit different and it's powered
 

63
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,870
bit different and it's powered
by today anyways a raspberry pi

64
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
by today anyways a raspberry pi
 

65
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,630
by today anyways a raspberry pi
3b plus i am not at all satisfied with

66
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
3b plus i am not at all satisfied with
 

67
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,910
3b plus i am not at all satisfied with
the performance of that which you're

68
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
the performance of that which you're
 

69
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,030
the performance of that which you're
about to see

70
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
about to see
 

71
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,230
about to see
um however it's given me a development

72
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
um however it's given me a development
 

73
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,109
um however it's given me a development
platform to

74
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
platform to
 

75
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,310
platform to
play around with now i may have to

76
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
play around with now i may have to
 

77
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,590
play around with now i may have to
install it on something

78
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
install it on something
 

79
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,630
install it on something
that can handle better graphics well why

80
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
that can handle better graphics well why
 

81
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,270
that can handle better graphics well why
do you need

82
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
do you need
 

83
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,030
do you need
graphics for a clock robbie because

84
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
graphics for a clock robbie because
 

85
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,469
graphics for a clock robbie because
i want to so this is what i'm working on

86
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
i want to so this is what i'm working on
 

87
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,830
i want to so this is what i'm working on
i based this on the aries jquery

88
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840
i based this on the aries jquery
 

89
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,190
i based this on the aries jquery
dashboard so you may be familiar with

90
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
dashboard so you may be familiar with
 

91
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,350
dashboard so you may be familiar with
that but what i've done is i've actually

92
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
that but what i've done is i've actually
 

93
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,389
that but what i've done is i've actually
created a functional clock

94
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
created a functional clock
 

95
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,950
created a functional clock
out of this system so um so i've taken

96
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
out of this system so um so i've taken
 

97
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,030
out of this system so um so i've taken
that it's basically a template

98
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
that it's basically a template
 

99
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,550
that it's basically a template
and then i've created a jquery clock

100
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
and then i've created a jquery clock
 

101
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,709
and then i've created a jquery clock
counter countdown disk check that uses

102
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
counter countdown disk check that uses
 

103
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,950
counter countdown disk check that uses
ajax to php to be able to check my

failures

108
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439

109
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,830
failures
or or hard drives that are full in our

110
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
or or hard drives that are full in our
 

111
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,990
or or hard drives that are full in our
array um

112
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
array um
 

113
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,830
array um
and i'll show you also it'll it even

114
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
and i'll show you also it'll it even
 

115
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,430
and i'll show you also it'll it even
shows when we're live on the air so

116
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
shows when we're live on the air so
 

117
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,790
shows when we're live on the air so
that's pretty cool right now it's not

118
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
that's pretty cool right now it's not
 

119
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,830
that's pretty cool right now it's not
connected so

120
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
connected so
 

121
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,470
connected so
we've got studio e up here these are the

122
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
we've got studio e up here these are the
 

123
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,070
we've got studio e up here these are the
only things that are not functional

124
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
only things that are not functional
 

125
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,990
only things that are not functional
these are just eye candy right now

126
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
these are just eye candy right now
 

127
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,309
these are just eye candy right now
um from the original theme i've left

128
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
um from the original theme i've left
 

129
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,750
um from the original theme i've left
them in just to make it

130
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
them in just to make it
 

131
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,070
them in just to make it
so that there's some filled space there

132
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
so that there's some filled space there
 

133
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,750
so that there's some filled space there
no point in removing them and having

134
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
no point in removing them and having
 

135
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,990
no point in removing them and having
having it not look symmetrical so

136
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
having it not look symmetrical so
 

137
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,509
having it not look symmetrical so
um so with this we can ignore those

138
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
um so with this we can ignore those
 

139
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,229
um so with this we can ignore those
things

140
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
things
 

141
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,470
things
here we have the actual functional clock

142
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
here we have the actual functional clock
 

143
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,509
here we have the actual functional clock
and i've got greek

144
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
and i've got greek
 

145
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,830
and i've got greek
for time there according to google

146
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
for time there according to google
 

147
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,490
for time there according to google
translate

148
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:40,500

[Laughter]

150
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
[Laughter]
 

151
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,229
[Laughter]
so we've got 9 46 is the time and we've

152
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
so we've got 9 46 is the time and we've
 

153
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,150
so we've got 9 46 is the time and we've
got a seconds counter here

154
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
got a seconds counter here
 

155
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,830
got a seconds counter here
10 11 12. so you can see how janky the

156
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
10 11 12. so you can see how janky the
 

157
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,830
10 11 12. so you can see how janky the
video is that's because of the raspberry

158
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
video is that's because of the raspberry
 

159
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,830
video is that's because of the raspberry
pi 3b plus not being

160
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
pi 3b plus not being
 

161
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,990
pi 3b plus not being
uh it's the graphics processing not

162
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
uh it's the graphics processing not
 

163
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,589
uh it's the graphics processing not

so every second there's a timer that

so every second there's a timer that
 

189
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,190
so every second there's a timer that
updates the time

so that's how it works so what we have

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
so that's how it works so what we have
 

215
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,869
so that's how it works so what we have

is now now we've seen that it's 9 47 we
can

00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
can
 

219
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,949
can
really easily calculate that we've got

00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
really easily calculate that we've got
 

221
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,710
really easily calculate that we've got

but if we look down here we actually
 

225
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,789
but if we look down here we actually
have a countdown that says time will be

00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
have a countdown that says time will be

33 you can see that jquery timer is a

33 you can see that jquery timer is a
 

231
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,149
33 you can see that jquery timer is a

it but not
well enough so i'm going to try a couple

well enough so i'm going to try a couple
 

261

of different sbcs

it has wi-fi which makes it a little

it has wi-fi which makes it a little

out up here so
as i'm recording this as we mentioned

00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
as i'm recording this as we mentioned

as i'm recording this as we mentioned
we're not actually broadcasting live

today this is all

today this is all
we've produced this behind like after

290
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
we've produced this behind like after
 

291
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,110
we've produced this behind like after
the fact so

292
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
the fact so
 

293
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,590
the fact so
um this shows the video feed is off the

294
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
um this shows the video feed is off the
 

295
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,990
um this shows the video feed is off the
air but as soon as we go live

296
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
air but as soon as we go live
 

297
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,710
air but as soon as we go live
this will actually shift to say on air

298
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
this will actually shift to say on air
 

299
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,710
this will actually shift to say on air
so that also serves a double purpose if

300
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
so that also serves a double purpose if
 

301
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,510
so that also serves a double purpose if
we're here

302
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
we're here
 

303
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,909
we're here

show
 

307
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,950
show
we'll notice that presumably i mean if

308
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
we'll notice that presumably i mean if
 

309
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,550
we'll notice that presumably i mean if
we look up we'll see that we're off the

310
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
we look up we'll see that we're off the
 

311
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,070
we look up we'll see that we're off the
air something's going on even though we

think we're on the air
 

315
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,670
think we're on the air
this will actually show that then this

316
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
this will actually show that then this
 

317
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,430
this will actually show that then this
is also functional

318
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
is also functional
 

319
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,670
is also functional
so this shows disk usage my disk usage

320
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
so this shows disk usage my disk usage
 

321
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,590
so this shows disk usage my disk usage
is not actually that bad although it is

what this is looking to do is it's going
 

327
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,150
what this is looking to do is it's going
to connect to samba

328
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
to connect to samba
 

329
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,590
to connect to samba
shares on my server and it does a disk

check every 15 seconds to see
 

333
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,710
check every 15 seconds to see
how much disk usage there is and this

334
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
how much disk usage there is and this
 

335
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,390
how much disk usage there is and this
will move automatically

336
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
will move automatically
 

337

is the sd card so you can see i'm using

344
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
is the sd card so you can see i'm using
 

345
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,430
is the sd card so you can see i'm using
about what looks like about ten percent

about what looks like about ten percent
eight percent of my sd card so these

348
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
eight percent of my sd card so these

the animation is so much better on a

352
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
the animation is so much better on a
 

353
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,870
the animation is so much better on a
computer

354
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
computer
 

355
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,830
computer
so i've got this little box here that

356
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
so i've got this little box here that
 

357
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,670
so i've got this little box here that
i'm thinking maybe i'll turn that into

358
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
i'm thinking maybe i'll turn that into
 

359
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,629
i'm thinking maybe i'll turn that into
my clock but

360
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
my clock but
 

361
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,790
my clock but
part of the idea is i want to create a

362
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
part of the idea is i want to create a
 

363
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,150
part of the idea is i want to create a
setup here that's

364
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
setup here that's
 

365
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,270
setup here that's
very low power consumption yet has some

366
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
very low power consumption yet has some
 

367
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,070
very low power consumption yet has some
eye candy

368
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
eye candy
 

369
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,870
eye candy
and is also functional so this serves

370
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
and is also functional so this serves
 

371
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,990
and is also functional so this serves
many purposes from the

372
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
many purposes from the
 

373
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,430
many purposes from the
time to the countdown um to the disk

374
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
time to the countdown um to the disk
 

375
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,629
time to the countdown um to the disk
usage warnings

376
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
usage warnings
 

377
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,029
usage warnings
and even showing us whether we're on air

378
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
and even showing us whether we're on air
 

379
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,629

responding this will go red

386
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
responding this will go red
 

387
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,350
responding this will go red
and it will warn us of that right here

388
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
and it will warn us of that right here
 

389
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,270
and it will warn us of that right here
you see an empty box and that's because

390
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
you see an empty box and that's because
 

391
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,870
you see an empty box and that's because
i have not yet plugged

392
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
i have not yet plugged
 

393
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,990
i have not yet plugged
a microphone into the raspberry pi this

394
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
a microphone into the raspberry pi this
 

395
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,270
a microphone into the raspberry pi this
is a spectrum

396
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
is a spectrum
 

397
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,309
is a spectrum
analyzer um so that

398
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
analyzer um so that
 

399
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,189
analyzer um so that
will actually show the the spectrum uh

400
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
will actually show the the spectrum uh
 

401
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,469
will actually show the the spectrum uh
in real time of

402
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
in real time of
 

403
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,589
in real time of
audio that's flowing through the

404
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
audio that's flowing through the
 

405
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,749
audio that's flowing through the
raspberry pi so i'm thinking maybe we'll

406
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
raspberry pi so i'm thinking maybe we'll
 

407
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,070
raspberry pi so i'm thinking maybe we'll
pull that off of our mixing console

408
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
pull that off of our mixing console
 

409
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,230
pull that off of our mixing console
so that we can actually see the audio

410
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
so that we can actually see the audio
 

411
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,670
so that we can actually see the audio
levels on the

412
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
levels on the
 

413
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,070
levels on the
on the dashboard so that's pretty cool

414
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
on the dashboard so that's pretty cool
 

415
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,670
on the dashboard so that's pretty cool
so that's my new clock

416
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
so that's my new clock
 

417
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,110
so that's my new clock
it's much more than a clock it's a

418
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
it's much more than a clock it's a
 

419
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,710
it's much more than a clock it's a
functional dashboard and going to be

420
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
functional dashboard and going to be
 

421
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,309
functional dashboard and going to be
growing over the next little while as i

422
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
growing over the next little while as i
 

423
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,189
growing over the next little while as i
develop it

424
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
develop it
 

425
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,870
develop it
it's not really ready for mainstream use

426
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
it's not really ready for mainstream use
 

427
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,870
it's not really ready for mainstream use
right yet however if you'd like to check

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
right yet however if you'd like to check
 

429
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,309
right yet however if you'd like to check
it out you'll see

430
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
it out you'll see
 

431
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,670

check it out if you have a pr for me to
 

443
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,629
check it out if you have a pr for me to
make it even funkier i'd love to see it

444
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
make it even funkier i'd love to see it
 

445
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,110
make it even funkier i'd love to see it
and i'm going to be working on figuring

446
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
and i'm going to be working on figuring
 

447
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,110
and i'm going to be working on figuring
out which platform which hardware

448
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
out which platform which hardware
 

449
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,110
out which platform which hardware
platform is going to work the best

450
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
platform is going to work the best
 

451
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,909
platform is going to work the best
i don't really want to put it on a pi 4

452
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
i don't really want to put it on a pi 4
 

453
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,230
i don't really want to put it on a pi 4
i

454
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
i
 

455
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,430
i
figure it probably will run better there

456
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
figure it probably will run better there
 

457
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,189
figure it probably will run better there
but that's a very expensive clock

458
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
but that's a very expensive clock
 

459
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,230
but that's a very expensive clock
very expensive clock so so

460
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
very expensive clock so so
 

461
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,390
very expensive clock so so
maybe though because there's dual video

462
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
maybe though because there's dual video
 

463
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,230
maybe though because there's dual video
output on a raspberry pi 4

output on a raspberry pi 4
 

465
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,950

i could offset that cost by running my

466
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
i could offset that cost by running my
 

467
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,070
i could offset that cost by running my

nem server on the fourth screen
 

469
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,869
nem server on the fourth screen
so that gives me some thought so maybe

470
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
so that gives me some thought so maybe
 

471
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,230
so that gives me some thought so maybe
i'm going to tinker with that what are

472
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
i'm going to tinker with that what are
 

473
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,990
i'm going to tinker with that what are
your thoughts what system should i run

474
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
your thoughts what system should i run
 

475
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,270
your thoughts what system should i run
it on what one do you think is going to

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
it on what one do you think is going to
 

477
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,670
it on what one do you think is going to
perform best as far as the graphics go

478
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
perform best as far as the graphics go
 

479
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,309
perform best as far as the graphics go
the processor is doing just fine it's

00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
the processor is doing just fine it's
 

481
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,670
the processor is doing just fine it's
able to do all this but it's the

482
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
able to do all this but it's the
 

483
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,430
able to do all this but it's the
