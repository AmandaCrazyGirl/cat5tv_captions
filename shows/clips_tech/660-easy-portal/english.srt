ordering it that's the size of the hole
not the actual size that's going to be

168
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
not the actual size that's going to be
 

169
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,150
not the actual size that's going to be
required for the hole

170
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
required for the hole
 

171

to 16.15 inches so the smaller one is

182
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
to 16.15 inches so the smaller one is
 

183
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,430

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,270
but again
the imperfections are just because of

330
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
the imperfections are just because of
 

331
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,670
the imperfections are just because of
the 3d print and i think that is

332
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
the 3d print and i think that is
 

333
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,550
the 3d print and i think that is
very very good and in fact this you know

334
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
very very good and in fact this you know
 

335
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,430
very very good and in fact this you know
i'm i'm

336
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
i'm i'm
 

337
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,029
i'm i'm
quite impressed with this it's it's

338
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
quite impressed with this it's it's
 

339
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,710
quite impressed with this it's it's
really really good quality

340
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
really really good quality
 

341
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,430
really really good quality
and exactly what i needed so let's see

342
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
and exactly what i needed so let's see
 

343
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,870
and exactly what i needed so let's see
how easy it really is

344
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
how easy it really is
 

345
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,430
how easy it really is
and get the easy portal installed so

346
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
and get the easy portal installed so
 

347
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,310
and get the easy portal installed so
that's the hole

348
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
that's the hole
 

349
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,189
that's the hole
in the on the bridge our production room

350
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
in the on the bridge our production room
 

351
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,990
in the on the bridge our production room
leading out

352
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
leading out
 

353
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,790
leading out
into the main studio so um so you can

354
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
into the main studio so um so you can
 

355
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,310
into the main studio so um so you can
see all the wires here

356
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
see all the wires here
 

357
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,029
see all the wires here
going in through the uh the pipe

358
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039

 

359
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,150

so we'll just pull that through and

360
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
so we'll just pull that through and
 

361
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,029
so we'll just pull that through and
no effort whatsoever to do uh to do the

362
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
no effort whatsoever to do uh to do the
 

363
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,390
no effort whatsoever to do uh to do the
installation you'll see but

364
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
installation you'll see but
 

365
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,070
installation you'll see but
uh for me it's just getting all this

366
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
uh for me it's just getting all this
 

367
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,670
uh for me it's just getting all this
stuff out of the way man

368
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
stuff out of the way man
 

369
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,870
stuff out of the way man
i forgot how big and bulky that pipe was

370
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
i forgot how big and bulky that pipe was
 

371
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,150
i forgot how big and bulky that pipe was
oh jeff all right all right

372
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
oh jeff all right all right
 

373
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,510
oh jeff all right all right
speaking of big and bulky check out our

374
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
speaking of big and bulky check out our
 

375
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,350
speaking of big and bulky check out our
old lights that's right now we're all

376
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
old lights that's right now we're all
 

377
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,430
old lights that's right now we're all
led so anybody want to buy some

378
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
led so anybody want to buy some
 

379
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,670
led so anybody want to buy some
some old lights now here i'm actually

380
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
some old lights now here i'm actually
 

381
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,670
some old lights now here i'm actually
kind of measuring all scientific like

382
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
kind of measuring all scientific like
 

383
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,070
kind of measuring all scientific like
uh the size of the flange to make sure

384
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
uh the size of the flange to make sure
 

385
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,710
uh the size of the flange to make sure
that the whole

386
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
that the whole
 

387
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,110
that the whole
because i did pre-drill a hole for the

388
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
because i did pre-drill a hole for the
 

389
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,790
because i did pre-drill a hole for the
pipe so i needed to actually

390
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
pipe so i needed to actually
 

391
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,510
pipe so i needed to actually
make this hole a little bit higher which

392
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
make this hole a little bit higher which
 

393
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,790
make this hole a little bit higher which
is a little bit difficult because i

394
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
is a little bit difficult because i
 

395
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,070
is a little bit difficult because i
already had a hole there but

396
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
already had a hole there but
 

397
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,990
already had a hole there but
i i was able to just kind of quickly

398
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
i i was able to just kind of quickly
 

399
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,830
i i was able to just kind of quickly
figure out how much room i needed for

400
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
figure out how much room i needed for
 

401
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,550
figure out how much room i needed for
the flange

402
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
the flange
 

403
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,830
the flange
and you can see on the other side and

404
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
and you can see on the other side and
 

405
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,189
and you can see on the other side and
now there's actually a little bit of a

406
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
now there's actually a little bit of a
 

407
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,790
now there's actually a little bit of a
broken space

408
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
broken space
 

409
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,029
broken space
on the lower part of the other side of

410
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
on the lower part of the other side of
 

411
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,309
on the lower part of the other side of
the wall you'll see that in a moment

412
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
the wall you'll see that in a moment
 

413
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,629
the wall you'll see that in a moment
here

414
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
here
 

415
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,629
here
even better jeff it's nice and flush

416
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
even better jeff it's nice and flush
 

417
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,270
even better jeff it's nice and flush
yeah so but here on the other side so i

418
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
yeah so but here on the other side so i
 

419
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,790
yeah so but here on the other side so i
came through from that side so that it

420
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
came through from that side so that it
 

421
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,909
came through from that side so that it
would line up really well

422
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
would line up really well
 

423
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,710
would line up really well
yeah but i think that previously there

424
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
yeah but i think that previously there
 

425
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,029
yeah but i think that previously there
was

426
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
was
 

427
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,469
was
some there was another hole there that

428
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
some there was another hole there that
 

429
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,230
some there was another hole there that
wasn't patched properly so that's why it

430
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
wasn't patched properly so that's why it
 

431
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,670
wasn't patched properly so that's why it
kind of cracked at the bottom there

432
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
kind of cracked at the bottom there
 

433
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,870
kind of cracked at the bottom there
right however my i'm lucky because the

434
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
right however my i'm lucky because the
 

435
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,950
right however my i'm lucky because the
flange is big enough to cover that

436
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
flange is big enough to cover that
 

437
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,350
flange is big enough to cover that
so even though you can see how bad it

438
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
so even though you can see how bad it
 

439
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,469
so even though you can see how bad it
looks right there

440
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
looks right there
 

441
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,990
looks right there
on the other side of the wall it covers

442
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
on the other side of the wall it covers
 

443
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,070
on the other side of the wall it covers
it up yeah the flange is big enough that

444
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
it up yeah the flange is big enough that
 

445
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,309
it up yeah the flange is big enough that
it

446
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
it
 

447
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,390
it
uh that it really does cover up any of

448
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
uh that it really does cover up any of
 

449
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,830
uh that it really does cover up any of
those kind of like

450
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
those kind of like
 

451
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,270
those kind of like
the damaged look see that wow that fits

452
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
the damaged look see that wow that fits
 

453
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,390
the damaged look see that wow that fits
so smoothly it's perfect so

454
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
so smoothly it's perfect so
 

455
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,550
so smoothly it's perfect so
that looks and i like that it covers up

456
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
that looks and i like that it covers up
 

457
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,830
that looks and i like that it covers up
my

458
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
my
 

459
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,430
my
horrible hack job but so super simple so

460
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
horrible hack job but so super simple so
 

461
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,629
horrible hack job but so super simple so
i'm just

462
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
i'm just
 

463
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,070
i'm just
do it by hand and we wondered if it

464
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
do it by hand and we wondered if it
 

465
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,430
do it by hand and we wondered if it
would spin and i needed someone on the

466
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
would spin and i needed someone on the
 

467
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,469
would spin and i needed someone on the
other side and nope

468
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
other side and nope
 

469
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,150
other side and nope
it worked perfectly incredible so i'm

470
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
it worked perfectly incredible so i'm
 

471
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,070
it worked perfectly incredible so i'm
pushing that through

472
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
pushing that through
 

473
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,270
pushing that through
so much easier now to run cable um

474
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
so much easier now to run cable um
 

475
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,710
so much easier now to run cable um
through the wall and it's only going

476
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
through the wall and it's only going
 

477
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,150
through the wall and it's only going
through that wall i don't have to feed

478
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
through that wall i don't have to feed
 

479
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,589
through that wall i don't have to feed
it through a big long pipe

480
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
it through a big long pipe
 

481
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,749
it through a big long pipe
which was part of the problem i couldn't

482
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
which was part of the problem i couldn't
 

483
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,790
which was part of the problem i couldn't
i couldn't feed

484
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
i couldn't feed
 

485
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,150
i couldn't feed
xlr cables through because there's no

486
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
xlr cables through because there's no
 

487
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,070
xlr cables through because there's no
way to push them through a 10-foot pipe

488
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
way to push them through a 10-foot pipe
 

489
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,830
way to push them through a 10-foot pipe
