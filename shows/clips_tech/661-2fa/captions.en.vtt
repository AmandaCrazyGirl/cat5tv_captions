that is

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:03:51.040><c> that's</c><00:03:51.440><c> the</c><00:03:51.599><c> right</c><00:03:51.920><c> password</c><00:03:52.959><c> but</c><00:03:53.439><c> i</c>

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the right password but i
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.030 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the right password but i
know<00:03:54.000><c> robbie</c><00:03:54.640><c> and</c><00:03:55.040><c> you're</c><00:03:55.280><c> not</c><00:03:55.519><c> him</c><00:03:56.480><c> right</c>
