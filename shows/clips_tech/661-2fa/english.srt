i couldn't grow a beard like that if i

88
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
i couldn't grow a beard like that if i
 

89
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,950
i couldn't grow a beard like that if i
tried

90
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
tried
 

91
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,550
tried
when you sign into your online account

92
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
when you sign into your online account
 

93
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,230
when you sign into your online account
you've got typically a username and a

94
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
you've got typically a username and a
 

95
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,670
you've got typically a username and a
password right

96
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
password right
 

97
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,469
password right
so that's basically so that the server

98
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
so that's basically so that the server
 

99
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,710
so that's basically so that the server
can tell that it is you that is logging

100
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
can tell that it is you that is logging
 

101
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,030
can tell that it is you that is logging
in

102
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
in
 

103
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,190
in
right your username is often something

104
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
right your username is often something
 

105
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,069
right your username is often something
that is

106
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
that is
 

107
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,670
that is
publicly accessible so that could be

108
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
publicly accessible so that could be
 

109
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,190
publicly accessible so that could be
your email address or

110
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
your email address or
 

111
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,429
your email address or
in my case like it could be baldnerd

112
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
in my case like it could be baldnerd
 

113
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,550
in my case like it could be baldnerd
right

114
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
right
 

115
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,749
right
so that username is not something that

116
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
so that username is not something that
 

117
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,830
so that username is not something that
is a security factor whatsoever of

118
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
is a security factor whatsoever of
 

119
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,990
is a security factor whatsoever of
course anyone can get that so

120
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
course anyone can get that so
 

121
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,830
course anyone can get that so
um anyone who knows your password

122
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
um anyone who knows your password
 

123
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,470
um anyone who knows your password
can say okay well my username is

124
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
can say okay well my username is
 

125
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,390
can say okay well my username is
baldnerd and my password is

126
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
baldnerd and my password is
 

127
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,390
baldnerd and my password is
winston2075 right so now they can access

128
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
winston2075 right so now they can access
 

129
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,350
winston2075 right so now they can access
your account because

130
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
your account because
 

131
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,790
your account because
those are the only factors that you have

132
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
those are the only factors that you have
 

133
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,470
those are the only factors that you have
basically just the password right

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
basically just the password right
 

135
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,470
basically just the password right
the plot thickens if you've got the same

136
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
the plot thickens if you've got the same
 

137
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,470
the plot thickens if you've got the same
password on other services as well which

138
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
password on other services as well which
 

139
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,830
password on other services as well which
so many people do

140
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
so many people do
 

141
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,910
so many people do
don't do that yeah and that's why we say

don't do that yeah and that's why we say
do not have the same password on other

144
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
do not have the same password on other
 

145
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,509
do not have the same password on other
services because

146
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
services because
 

147
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,990
services because
if you get compromised on one you're now

148
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
if you get compromised on one you're now
 

149

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
they can click on forgot password
 

167
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,790
they can click on forgot password
and they're going to be able to reset

168
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
and they're going to be able to reset
 

169
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,390
and they're going to be able to reset
your password and gain access to those

170
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
your password and gain access to those
 

171
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,070
your password and gain access to those
services as well

so with the username and password

174
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
so with the username and password
 

175
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,350
so with the username and password
combination

176
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
combination
 

177
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,750
combination
the server itself so the connecting

178
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
the server itself so the connecting
 

179
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,190
the server itself so the connecting
server whether it's like

180
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
server whether it's like
 

181
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,830

your online banking or twitter or

182
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
your online banking or twitter or
 

183
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,110
your online banking or twitter or
facebook or whatever it is you're

184
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
facebook or whatever it is you're
 

185
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,550
facebook or whatever it is you're
logging into

186
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
logging into
 

187
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,190
logging into
it has no way of actually verifying that

188
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
it has no way of actually verifying that
 

189
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,430
it has no way of actually verifying that
the person who's logging in

190
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
the person who's logging in
 

191
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,710
the person who's logging in
is in fact you right

192
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
is in fact you right
 

193
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,270
is in fact you right
they know the username and password and

194
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
they know the username and password and
 

195
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,070
they know the username and password and
so they're

196
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
so they're
 

197
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,949
so they're
given access right so two-factor

198
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
given access right so two-factor
 

199
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,830
given access right so two-factor
authentication

200
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
authentication
 

201
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,350
authentication
sometimes called multi-factor

202
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
sometimes called multi-factor
 

203
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,070
sometimes called multi-factor
authentication it can be intimidating

204
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
authentication it can be intimidating
 

205
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,390
authentication it can be intimidating
it can sound kind of complicated but

206
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
it can sound kind of complicated but
 

207
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,390
it can sound kind of complicated but
really

208
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
really
 

209
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,110
really
it's just a way for the online server to

210
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
it's just a way for the online server to
 

211
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,910
it's just a way for the online server to
recognize

212
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
recognize
 

213
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,270
recognize
that when uh when someone is logging in

214
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
that when uh when someone is logging in
 

215
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,630
that when uh when someone is logging in
as you that it is in fact

216
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
as you that it is in fact
 

217
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,589
as you that it is in fact
you you right um so the server is able

218
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
you you right um so the server is able
 

219
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,630
you you right um so the server is able
to say

220
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
to say
 

221
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,750
to say
yeah that's the right password but i

222
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
yeah that's the right password but i
 

223
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,030
yeah that's the right password but i
know robbie and you're not him right

224
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
know robbie and you're not him right
 

225
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,149
know robbie and you're not him right
okay so then how do we do that and

226
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
okay so then how do we do that and
 

227
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,149
okay so then how do we do that and
really it comes down to that the easiest

228
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
really it comes down to that the easiest
 

229
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,270
really it comes down to that the easiest
way

230
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
way
 

231
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,630
way
is something like this something you

232
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
is something like this something you
 

233
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,190
is something like this something you
already own

234
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
already own
 

235
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,030
already own
your smartphone right how many of us

236
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
your smartphone right how many of us
 

237
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,789
your smartphone right how many of us
have a smartphone sitting in our pocket

238
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
have a smartphone sitting in our pocket
 

239
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,350
have a smartphone sitting in our pocket
right now

240
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360

right now
exactly you might be watching the show

242
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
exactly you might be watching the show
 

243
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,910
exactly you might be watching the show
on your smartphone you've got it on you

244
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
on your smartphone you've got it on you
 

245
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,909
on your smartphone you've got it on you
all the time that's right that is

246
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
all the time that's right that is
 

247
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,189
all the time that's right that is
probably my wife's biggest complaint

248
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
probably my wife's biggest complaint
 

249
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,390
probably my wife's biggest complaint
about me

250
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
about me
 

251
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,790
about me
is that it's literally on me all the

252
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
is that it's literally on me all the
 

253
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,310
is that it's literally on me all the
time but that's convenient when it comes

254
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
time but that's convenient when it comes
 

255
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,950
time but that's convenient when it comes
to this

256
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
to this
 

257
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,430
to this
absolutely it is because even though

258
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
absolutely it is because even though
 

259
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,710
absolutely it is because even though
somebody might be able to

260
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
somebody might be able to
 

261
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,909
somebody might be able to
obtain your password and your email uh

262
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
obtain your password and your email uh
 

263
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,070
obtain your password and your email uh
because that's not really impossible

264
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
because that's not really impossible
 

265
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,790
because that's not really impossible
it's a lot harder and less likely that

266
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
it's a lot harder and less likely that
 

267
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,710
it's a lot harder and less likely that
they're going to have physical access

268
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
they're going to have physical access
 

269
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,870
they're going to have physical access
to your phone so with two factor

270
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
to your phone so with two factor
 

271
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,469
to your phone so with two factor
authentication enabled

272
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
authentication enabled
 

273
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,870
authentication enabled
once you enter your password uh and your

274
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
once you enter your password uh and your
 

275
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,469
once you enter your password uh and your
login for the account

276
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
login for the account
 

277
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,870
login for the account
you'll be uh prompted to obtain and

278
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
you'll be uh prompted to obtain and
 

279
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,790
you'll be uh prompted to obtain and
enter a code from your phone it could

280
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
enter a code from your phone it could
 

281
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,550
enter a code from your phone it could
come in through text or

282
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
come in through text or
 

283
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,950
come in through text or
you know maybe through an app whatever

284
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
you know maybe through an app whatever
 

285
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,030
you know maybe through an app whatever
but you know your phone becomes that

286
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
but you know your phone becomes that
 

287
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,430
but you know your phone becomes that
second factor in the authentication

288
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
second factor in the authentication
 

289
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,390
second factor in the authentication
process

290
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
process
 

291
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,670
process
which makes it two-factor authentication

292
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
which makes it two-factor authentication
 

293
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,510
which makes it two-factor authentication
so it's not really as complicated as it

294
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
so it's not really as complicated as it
 

295
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,510
so it's not really as complicated as it
sounds online services

296
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
sounds online services
 

297
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,629
sounds online services
um such as google drive yep gmail

298
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
um such as google drive yep gmail
 

299
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,150
um such as google drive yep gmail
is is part of that um we we talk about

300
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
is is part of that um we we talk about
 

301
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,670
is is part of that um we we talk about
amazon and aws

302
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
amazon and aws
 

303
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,909
amazon and aws
that's right twitter facebook your

304
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
that's right twitter facebook your

online banking
 

307
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,870
online banking
they all support multi-factor

308
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
they all support multi-factor
 

309
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,150
they all support multi-factor
authentication so

310
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
authentication so
 

311
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,710
authentication so
