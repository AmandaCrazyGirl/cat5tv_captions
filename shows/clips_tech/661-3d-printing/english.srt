00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,350

i've been

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
i've been
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,030
i've been
teaching myself how to

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
teaching myself how to
 

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,390
teaching myself how to
use a 3d printer and also it's arrived

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
use a 3d printer and also it's arrived
 

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,589
use a 3d printer and also it's arrived
well no well this is the thing is is

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
well no well this is the thing is is
 

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,630
well no well this is the thing is is
my my experiment

10
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
my my experiment
 

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,950
my my experiment
is i want to know if i were to get a 3d

12
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
is i want to know if i were to get a 3d
 

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,990
is i want to know if i were to get a 3d
printer

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
printer
 

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,830
printer
is it going to be so onerous

16
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
is it going to be so onerous
 

17
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,630
is it going to be so onerous
for me to learn how to use it that

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
for me to learn how to use it that
 

19
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,950
for me to learn how to use it that
it becomes another one of those

20
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
it becomes another one of those
 

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,270
it becomes another one of those
technologies that i purchase

22
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
technologies that i purchase
 

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,830
technologies that i purchase
and then never use right because we fall

24
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
and then never use right because we fall
 

25
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,430
and then never use right because we fall
into that that's right

26
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
into that that's right
 

27
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,270
into that that's right
cool tech comes out and you want it and

28
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
cool tech comes out and you want it and
 

29
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,350
cool tech comes out and you want it and
you buy it and then it's too hard to

30
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
you buy it and then it's too hard to
 

31
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,869
you buy it and then it's too hard to
learn and you don't have time and it

32
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
learn and you don't have time and it
 

33
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,790
learn and you don't have time and it
just sits on a shelf somewhere

34
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
just sits on a shelf somewhere
 

35
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,190
just sits on a shelf somewhere
and then it becomes obsolete yes so i've

36
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
and then it becomes obsolete yes so i've
 

37
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,869
and then it becomes obsolete yes so i've
taken a different approach and said okay

38
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
taken a different approach and said okay
 

39
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,430
taken a different approach and said okay
i'm going to learn how to 3d print first

40
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
i'm going to learn how to 3d print first
 

41
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,910
i'm going to learn how to 3d print first
okay and then i'm going to

42
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
okay and then i'm going to
 

43
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,590
okay and then i'm going to
make that decision so yes working with

44
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
make that decision so yes working with
 

45
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,830
make that decision so yes working with
design very cool so i use a tool

46
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
design very cool so i use a tool
 

47
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,950
design very cool so i use a tool

cool so what ideas have you come up with
so my original ideas

58
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
so my original ideas
 

59
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,429
so my original ideas
are very very basic jeff as you can

are very very basic jeff as you can
imagine i mean i'm just learning

62
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
imagine i mean i'm just learning
 

63
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,149
imagine i mean i'm just learning
the ropes but so so

64
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
the ropes but so so
 

65
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,830
the ropes but so so
and i mentioned this two weeks ago when

66
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
and i mentioned this two weeks ago when
 

67
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,510
and i mentioned this two weeks ago when
you were here that i was going to do

68
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
you were here that i was going to do
 

69
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,789
you were here that i was going to do
this and i've done it

70
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
this and i've done it
 

71
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,390
this and i've done it
is that in my laundry room

72
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
is that in my laundry room
 

73
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,350
is that in my laundry room
i wanted a place to hang face masks

74
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
i wanted a place to hang face masks
 

75
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,230
i wanted a place to hang face masks
because

76
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
because
 

77
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,630
because
we have we've got three kids at home yes

78
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
we have we've got three kids at home yes
 

79

we have we've got three kids at home yes
and we all have

80
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
and we all have
 

81
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,749
and we all have
five or more of these i think i've got

82
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
five or more of these i think i've got
 

83
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,429
five or more of these i think i've got
like 10 of them myself because i'm

84
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
like 10 of them myself because i'm
 

85
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,950
like 10 of them myself because i'm
working in the field and the kids each

86
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
working in the field and the kids each
 

87
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,950
working in the field and the kids each
have five yeah face masks

88
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
have five yeah face masks
 

89
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,990
have five yeah face masks
but we bought the washable ones

90
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
but we bought the washable ones
 

91
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,990
but we bought the washable ones
and you don't want to put them through

92
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
and you don't want to put them through
 

93
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,190
and you don't want to put them through
the dryer so

94
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
the dryer so
 

95
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,310
the dryer so
right i want to make a rack for them so

96
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
right i want to make a rack for them so
 

97
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,069
right i want to make a rack for them so
i've designed i haven't printed because

98
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
i've designed i haven't printed because
 

99
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,590
i've designed i haven't printed because
i don't have a 3d printer

100
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
i don't have a 3d printer
 

101
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,709
i don't have a 3d printer
but this was the experiment can i design

102
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
but this was the experiment can i design
 

103
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,109
but this was the experiment can i design
the the idea that comes to mind which is

104
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
the the idea that comes to mind which is
 

105
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,910
the the idea that comes to mind which is
a

106
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
a
 

107
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,109
a
half inch piece of pvc pipe hanging in

108
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
half inch piece of pvc pipe hanging in
 

109
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,790
half inch piece of pvc pipe hanging in
the unfinished laundry room so i've got

110
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
the unfinished laundry room so i've got
 

111
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,309
the unfinished laundry room so i've got
access to the rafters i can just screw

112
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
access to the rafters i can just screw
 

113
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,430
access to the rafters i can just screw
right into them

114
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
right into them
 

115
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,710
right into them
and so i designed the um the mech

116
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
and so i designed the um the mech
 

117
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,470
and so i designed the um the mech
well the mechanism the plates to put the

118
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
well the mechanism the plates to put the
 

119
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,190
well the mechanism the plates to put the
half inch pvc up on the ceiling okay

120
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
half inch pvc up on the ceiling okay
 

121
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,750
half inch pvc up on the ceiling okay
hanging

122
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
hanging
 

123
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,589
hanging
and the hooks that are going to hook on

124
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
and the hooks that are going to hook on
 

125
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,589
and the hooks that are going to hook on
to that to allow us to hang as many

126
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
to that to allow us to hang as many
 

127
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,710
to that to allow us to hang as many
masks as we want

128
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
masks as we want
 

129
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,869
masks as we want
very cool so it is kind of cool so it

130
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
very cool so it is kind of cool so it
 

131
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,150
very cool so it is kind of cool so it
feels like something that

132
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
feels like something that
 

133
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,550
feels like something that
i hey i'm i'm actually designing i'm

134
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
i hey i'm i'm actually designing i'm
 

135
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,830
i hey i'm i'm actually designing i'm
actually creating

136
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
actually creating
 

137
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,910
actually creating
based on a need based on something that

138
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
based on a need based on something that
 

139
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,750
based on a need based on something that
i probably couldn't just walk into a

140
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
i probably couldn't just walk into a
 

141
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,589
i probably couldn't just walk into a
hardware store and buy

142
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
hardware store and buy
 

143
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,470
hardware store and buy
and probably doing it a lot cheaper

144
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
and probably doing it a lot cheaper
 

145
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,470
and probably doing it a lot cheaper
there's the cost of a 3d printer

146
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
there's the cost of a 3d printer
 

147
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,110
there's the cost of a 3d printer
but as bp9 mentioned in on on the

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
but as bp9 mentioned in on on the

the the fact is is that even though

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
the the fact is is that even though
 

153
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,910
the the fact is is that even though
there's an investment in the 3d printer

154

there's an investment in the 3d printer
 

155
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,350
there's an investment in the 3d printer
which is pretty cheap these days

156

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,949
there
and they're not very expensive so the

164
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
and they're not very expensive so the
 

165
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,509
and they're not very expensive so the
the

166
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
the
 

167
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,030
the
initial hurdle of like the investment

168
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
initial hurdle of like the investment
 

169
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,630
initial hurdle of like the investment
is there but fairly quickly as you

170
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
is there but fairly quickly as you
 

171
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,630
is there but fairly quickly as you
design and print things you're going to

172
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
design and print things you're going to
 

173
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,910
design and print things you're going to
make that back of course

174
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
make that back of course
 

175
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,750
make that back of course
that's the idea yeah and that makes

176
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
that's the idea yeah and that makes
 

177
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,990
that's the idea yeah and that makes
sense i'm really seeing that as i l

178
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
sense i'm really seeing that as i l
 

179
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,750
sense i'm really seeing that as i l
as i look at things in online shopping

180
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
as i look at things in online shopping
 

181
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,750
as i look at things in online shopping
and think could i this is the challenge

182
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
and think could i this is the challenge
 

183
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,869
and think could i this is the challenge
that i've given myself

184
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
that i've given myself
 

185
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,750
that i've given myself
could i create that myself with a 3d

186
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
could i create that myself with a 3d
 

187
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,550
could i create that myself with a 3d
printer

188
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
printer
 

189
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,309
printer
and then i start looking at okay well

190
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
and then i start looking at okay well
 

191
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,910
and then i start looking at okay well
that thing

192
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
that thing
 

193
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,190
that thing
would cost me 20 and i could print it

194
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
would cost me 20 and i could print it
 

195
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,710
would cost me 20 and i could print it
for 20 cents

196
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
for 20 cents
 

197
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,190
for 20 cents
right so how quickly could i make that

198
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
right so how quickly could i make that
 

199
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,070
right so how quickly could i make that
back

200
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
back
 

201
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,390
back
it's an interesting experiment but but

202
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
it's an interesting experiment but but
 

203
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,390
it's an interesting experiment but but
i've proven to myself that

204
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
i've proven to myself that
 

205
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,190
i've proven to myself that
one i can design things i can take my
