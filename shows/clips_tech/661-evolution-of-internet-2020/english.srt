00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,350
it's going to go completely
wireless if you can remove that

170
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
wireless if you can remove that
 

171
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,550
wireless if you can remove that
physical cable uh are we

172
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
physical cable uh are we
 

173
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,589
physical cable uh are we
there yet are we already there

174
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
there yet are we already there
 

175
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,309
there yet are we already there
to some degree i mean i use the wi-fi

176
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
to some degree i mean i use the wi-fi
 

177
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,910
to some degree i mean i use the wi-fi
yeah the tech is there but i think from

178
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
yeah the tech is there but i think from
 

179
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,589
yeah the tech is there but i think from
an infrastructure standpoint

180
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
an infrastructure standpoint
 

181
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,910
an infrastructure standpoint
we're not there there's a whole lot that

182
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
we're not there there's a whole lot that
 

183
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,509
we're not there there's a whole lot that
would have to come in place to make that

184
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
would have to come in place to make that
 

185
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,190
would have to come in place to make that
more reliable but at the same time

186
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
more reliable but at the same time
 

187
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,149
more reliable but at the same time
you've got

188
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
you've got
 

189
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,070
you've got

um is it a tesla working on their
 

191
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,430
um is it a tesla working on their
satellite network it's going to hit the

192
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
satellite network it's going to hit the
 

193
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,350
satellite network it's going to hit the
globe not tesla but

194
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360

think it's gonna be wireless and i think

204
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
think it's gonna be wireless and i think
 

205
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,509
think it's gonna be wireless and i think
it's gonna

206
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
it's gonna
 

207
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,070
it's gonna
allow bandwidth to go so much faster uh

208
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
allow bandwidth to go so much faster uh
 

209
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,670
allow bandwidth to go so much faster uh
it'll be interesting to see how it

210
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
it'll be interesting to see how it
 

211
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,430
it'll be interesting to see how it
progresses over the years and and what

212
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
progresses over the years and and what
 

213
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,229
progresses over the years and and what
it changes

214
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
it changes
 

215
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,910
it changes
what's uh what's really kind of catching

216
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
what's uh what's really kind of catching

in the back end on your device and i'm

244
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
in the back end on your device and i'm
 

245
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,789
in the back end on your device and i'm
and so i was thinking about that going

this is just with bluetooth is there a

248
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
this is just with bluetooth is there a
 

249
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,990
this is just with bluetooth is there a
way to have

250
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
way to have
 

251
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,670

almost like hot spotting as you go

252
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
almost like hot spotting as you go
 

253
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,629
almost like hot spotting as you go
with mobile phones that would allow this

254
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
with mobile phones that would allow this
 

255
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,990
with mobile phones that would allow this
constant wireless network to be like

256
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
constant wireless network to be like
 

257
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,350
constant wireless network to be like
so interesting i mean a couple things

258
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
so interesting i mean a couple things
 

259
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,030
so interesting i mean a couple things
come to mind jeff first

260
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
come to mind jeff first
 

261
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,710
come to mind jeff first
first of all when you start talking

262
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
first of all when you start talking
 

263
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,070
first of all when you start talking
about wireless i start thinking about

264
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
about wireless i start thinking about
 

265
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,150
about wireless i start thinking about
man that would be so expensive

266
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
man that would be so expensive
 

267
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,749
man that would be so expensive
but the interesting thing is that with

268
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
but the interesting thing is that with
 

269
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,590
but the interesting thing is that with
the progression of technology

270
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
the progression of technology
 

271
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,710
the progression of technology
and the the betterment of the underlying

272
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
and the the betterment of the underlying
 

273
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,510
and the the betterment of the underlying
infrastructure the cost to the end

274
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
infrastructure the cost to the end
 

275
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,030
infrastructure the cost to the end
consumers goes down

276
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
consumers goes down
 

277
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,590
consumers goes down
yeah so we're going to see that price go

278
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
yeah so we're going to see that price go
 

279
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,230
yeah so we're going to see that price go
down so

280
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
down so
 

281
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,150
down so
maybe my my smartphone and the ability

282
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
maybe my my smartphone and the ability
 

283
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,110
maybe my my smartphone and the ability
to connect to

284
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
to connect to
 

285
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,469
to connect to
five 6g internet is going to drop

286
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
five 6g internet is going to drop
 

287
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,310
five 6g internet is going to drop
and when that happens now all of a

288
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
and when that happens now all of a
 

289
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,550
and when that happens now all of a
sudden autonomous vehicles become

290
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
sudden autonomous vehicles become
 

291
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,629
sudden autonomous vehicles become
much more autonomous that's right

292
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
much more autonomous that's right
 

293
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,390
much more autonomous that's right
because they're internet connected

294
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
because they're internet connected
 

295
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,629
because they're internet connected
all the time with a high-speed internet

296
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
all the time with a high-speed internet
 

297
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,230
all the time with a high-speed internet
connection yeah

298
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
connection yeah
 

299
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,230
connection yeah
and and then we've got all these new new

300
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
and and then we've got all these new new
 

301
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,070
and and then we've got all these new new
technologies that can just open up

302
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
technologies that can just open up
 

303
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,990
technologies that can just open up
that's right and things like these apps

304
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
that's right and things like these apps
 

305
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,990
that's right and things like these apps
that communicate but then the second

306
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
that communicate but then the second
 

307
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,189
that communicate but then the second
thing that comes to mind is

308
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
thing that comes to mind is
 

309
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,950
thing that comes to mind is
