there i am moving it around

976
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
there i am moving it around
 

977
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,630
there i am moving it around
apparently i'm in like left-handed mode

978
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
apparently i'm in like left-handed mode
 

979
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,830
apparently i'm in like left-handed mode
on the mouse though

980
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
on the mouse though
 

981
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,909
on the mouse though
that's strange so let's see if there's a

982
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
that's strange so let's see if there's a
 

983
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,350
that's strange so let's see if there's a
quick way to fix that

984
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360

 

985
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,270

it's a little bit slow too so i might

986
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
it's a little bit slow too so i might
 

987
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,510
it's a little bit slow too so i might
want to accelerate the mouse

988
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
want to accelerate the mouse
 

989
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,430
want to accelerate the mouse
so let's see if i can just like turn it

990
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
so let's see if i can just like turn it
 

991
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,470
so let's see if i can just like turn it
up a bit

992
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480

 

993
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,710
