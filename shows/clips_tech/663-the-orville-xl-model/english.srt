that idea but i haven't been able to

196

that idea but i haven't been able to
 

197
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,710
that idea but i haven't been able to
find it so i think that that might have

find it so i think that that might have
 

199
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,470
find it so i think that that might have
been like a custom base that was

been like a custom base that was
 

201
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,309
been like a custom base that was
like for maybe for tom or something like

like for maybe for tom or something like
 

203
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,869
like for maybe for tom or something like
that so that just kind of snaps together
