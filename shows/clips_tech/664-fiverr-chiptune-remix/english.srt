really simple revision though i would
expect

dragging one note down as long as he's
not actually playing this out

bits but it seems to me like that's
 

1109
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,149

probably something that he can just

1110
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159
probably something that he can just
 

1111
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,470
probably something that he can just
pull together in the sequencer if he's

1112
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
pull together in the sequencer if he's
