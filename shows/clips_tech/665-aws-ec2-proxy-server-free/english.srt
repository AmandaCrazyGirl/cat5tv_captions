done we're going to jump on to aws

128
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
done we're going to jump on to aws
 

129
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,949
done we're going to jump on to aws
and in particular ec2 so of course

130
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
and in particular ec2 so of course
 

131
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,910
and in particular ec2 so of course
you if you're not familiar with aws just

132
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
you if you're not familiar with aws just
 

133
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,070
you if you're not familiar with aws just
go to aws.amazon.com

134
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
go to aws.amazon.com
 

135
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,150
go to aws.amazon.com
sign in with your amazon account and

136
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
sign in with your amazon account and
 

137
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,869
sign in with your amazon account and
then do a quick search for

138
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:51,879
then do a quick search for
 

139
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,509
then do a quick search for
ec2 and that will take you into

140
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
ec2 and that will take you into
 

141
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,509
ec2 and that will take you into
basically their virtualization platform

142
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
basically their virtualization platform
 

143
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,949
basically their virtualization platform
think of ec2 as

144
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
think of ec2 as
 

145
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,910
think of ec2 as
just that so the first thing i note when

146
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
just that so the first thing i note when
 

147
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,790
just that so the first thing i note when
i'm here

148
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
i'm here
 

149
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,229
i'm here
in ec2 is my region and this is

150
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
in ec2 is my region and this is
 

151
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,470
in ec2 is my region and this is
important because this is where my proxy

152
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
important because this is where my proxy
 

153
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,470
important because this is where my proxy
server is going to reside

154
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
server is going to reside
 

155
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,350
server is going to reside
should i set it there why is that

156
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
should i set it there why is that
 

157
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,790
should i set it there why is that
important well think about this

158
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
important well think about this
 

159
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,710
important well think about this
let's say i'm using a video streaming

160
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
let's say i'm using a video streaming
 

161
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,990
let's say i'm using a video streaming
service that

162
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
service that
 

163
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,949
service that
restricts canadian access to their video

164
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
restricts canadian access to their video
 

165
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,470
restricts canadian access to their video

can even put a server in africa
 

189
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,149
can even put a server in africa
or asia look at that you can put one

190
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
or asia look at that you can put one
 

191
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,750
or asia look at that you can put one
right in hong kong

right in hong kong
you can put one in canada a uh in europe

194
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
you can put one in canada a uh in europe
 

195
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,430
you can put one in canada a uh in europe
you've got

196
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
you've got
 

197
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,470
you've got
all over the place and then we've got

198
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
all over the place and then we've got
 

199
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,030
all over the place and then we've got
middle east and south america right now

00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
it's a pretty big list of where they
 

205
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,589
it's a pretty big list of where they
have this infrastructure set up for

it does a drop down and this gives me
 

241
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,749
it does a drop down and this gives me
a list of um operating systems that i

when i said instance i'm talking about a

264
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
when i said instance i'm talking about a
 

265
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,510
when i said instance i'm talking about a
virtual machine

266

virtual machine
 

267
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,150
virtual machine
so that is literally a virtual machine

268
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
so that is literally a virtual machine
 

269
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,430
so that is literally a virtual machine
so i'm going to deploy one of these

270
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
so i'm going to deploy one of these
 

271
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,909
so i'm going to deploy one of these
operating systems to an instance of ec2

272
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
operating systems to an instance of ec2
 

273
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,629
operating systems to an instance of ec2
which is

274
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
which is
 

275
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,550
which is
a virtual machine so what do i want it

276
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
a virtual machine so what do i want it
 

277
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,070
a virtual machine so what do i want it
to be

278
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
to be
 

279
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,950

done it before because i deploy a ton of

288
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
done it before because i deploy a ton of
 

289
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,390
done it before because i deploy a ton of
servers

290
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
servers
 

291
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,950
servers
in the cloud i'm gonna click on debian

292
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
in the cloud i'm gonna click on debian
 

293
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,870
in the cloud i'm gonna click on debian
uh just type in debian into the search

294
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
uh just type in debian into the search
 

295
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,350
uh just type in debian into the search
here

296

here
 

297
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,550
here
so then i'm gonna go to aws

298
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
so then i'm gonna go to aws
 

299
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,590
so then i'm gonna go to aws
marketplace results there are also

300
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
marketplace results there are also
 

301
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,909
marketplace results there are also
ones that i've created and ones in the

304
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
community
 

305
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,390
community
you would think oh well i want to use

306
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
you would think oh well i want to use
 

307
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,990
you would think oh well i want to use
community ones well no you don't because

308
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
community ones well no you don't because
 

309
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,070
community ones well no you don't because
those ones are going to cost you money

310
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
those ones are going to cost you money
 

311
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,909
those ones are going to cost you money
and you say well but community is free

312
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
and you say well but community is free
 

313
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,590
and you say well but community is free
it's open source and yes

314
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
it's open source and yes
 

315
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,790
it's open source and yes
however it's um not a part of the aws

316
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
however it's um not a part of the aws
 

317
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,150
however it's um not a part of the aws
marketplace and so you're going to have

318
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
marketplace and so you're going to have
 

319
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,909
marketplace and so you're going to have
to pay for the usage

320
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
to pay for the usage
 

321
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,590
to pay for the usage
to have that virtual machine that

322
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
to have that virtual machine that
 

323
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,590
to have that virtual machine that
instance running

324
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
instance running
 

325
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,430
instance running
in the cloud so instead we're going to

326
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
in the cloud so instead we're going to
 

327
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,629
in the cloud so instead we're going to
use one of the official ones from the

328
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
use one of the official ones from the
 

329
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,629
use one of the official ones from the
aws marketplace let's see what results

330
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639

if we want the free tier we've got to go
 

355
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,990
if we want the free tier we've got to go
with a t2 micro so

356
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
with a t2 micro so
 

357
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,270
with a t2 micro so
i'm going to select that but what does

358
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
i'm going to select that but what does
 

359
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,070
i'm going to select that but what does
it give us it gives us one cpu

360
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
it give us it gives us one cpu
 

361
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,590
it give us it gives us one cpu
one gigabyte of memory um

362
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
one gigabyte of memory um
 

363
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,510
one gigabyte of memory um
and then we've got storage to deal with

364
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
and then we've got storage to deal with
 

365
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,870
and then we've got storage to deal with
we don't need a lot of storage because

366
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
we don't need a lot of storage because
 

367
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,189
we don't need a lot of storage because
we're just setting up a basic proxy

368
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
we're just setting up a basic proxy
 

369
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,110
we're just setting up a basic proxy
and that's about it so i'm going to

370
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
and that's about it so i'm going to
 

371
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,629
and that's about it so i'm going to
deploy just as

372
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
deploy just as
 

373
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,350
deploy just as
that so t2 micro is the one that's free

374
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
that so t2 micro is the one that's free
 

375
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,070
that so t2 micro is the one that's free

for it
 

383
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,909
for it
right away i'm going to review and

384
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
right away i'm going to review and
 

385
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,710
right away i'm going to review and
launch we're going to come back to do

386
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
launch we're going to come back to do
 

387
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,070
launch we're going to come back to do
settings like our security groups and

388
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
settings like our security groups and
 

389
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,110
settings like our security groups and
things like that i'm just going to leave

390
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
things like that i'm just going to leave
 

391
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,749
things like that i'm just going to leave
everything

392
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
everything
 

393
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,749
everything
by default for now and we're going to

394
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
by default for now and we're going to
 

395
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,870
by default for now and we're going to
launch that so

396
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
launch that so
 

397
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,189
launch that so
first of all i need to create a new key

398
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
first of all i need to create a new key
 

399
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,469
first of all i need to create a new key
pair so this is

400
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
pair so this is
 

401
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,629
pair so this is
the ssh key that i'm going to use in

402
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
the ssh key that i'm going to use in
 

403
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,710
the ssh key that i'm going to use in
order to ssh into

404
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
order to ssh into
 

405
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,950
order to ssh into
this server so i'm going to call this

406
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
this server so i'm going to call this
 

407
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,790
this server so i'm going to call this
one proxy

408
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
one proxy
 

409
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,430
one proxy
server and then download my key pair

410
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
server and then download my key pair
 

411
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,110
server and then download my key pair
make sure you save that somewhere safe

412
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
make sure you save that somewhere safe
 

413
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,589
make sure you save that somewhere safe
i'm going to

414
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
i'm going to
 

415
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,950
i'm going to
throw that onto my server and drop that

416
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
throw that onto my server and drop that
 

417
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,070
throw that onto my server and drop that
there

418
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
there
 

419
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,189
there
and now launch instance means power

420
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
and now launch instance means power
 

421
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,510
and now launch instance means power
on your virtual machine so i'm going to

422
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
on your virtual machine so i'm going to
 

423
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,670
on your virtual machine so i'm going to
push that

424
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
push that
 

425
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,270
push that
and there we go so it's basically

426
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
and there we go so it's basically
 

427
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,749
and there we go so it's basically
creating it is creating a virtual

428
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
creating it is creating a virtual
 

429
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,629
creating it is creating a virtual
machine

430
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
machine
 

431
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,230
machine
an ec2 instance in the cloud for us in

432
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
an ec2 instance in the cloud for us in
 

433
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,950
an ec2 instance in the cloud for us in
uh in northern california so there we go

434
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
uh in northern california so there we go
 

435
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,350
uh in northern california so there we go
so

436
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
so
 

437
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,550
so
i'm going to view instances down here

438
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
i'm going to view instances down here
 

439
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,390
i'm going to view instances down here
and now i can see i now have one

440
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
and now i can see i now have one
 

441
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,469
and now i can see i now have one
instance running a t2 micro

442
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
instance running a t2 micro
 

443
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,110
instance running a t2 micro
and it is just no name so i'm going to

444
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
and it is just no name so i'm going to
 

445
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,469
and it is just no name so i'm going to
click on edit and i'm going to call this

446
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
click on edit and i'm going to call this
 

447
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,070
click on edit and i'm going to call this
my proxy server

448
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
my proxy server
 

449
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,110
my proxy server
server try that there we go okay so it's

450
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
server try that there we go okay so it's
 

451
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,710
server try that there we go okay so it's
already up and running

452
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
already up and running
 

453
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,790
already up and running
so if i click on that i can see the ip

454
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
so if i click on that i can see the ip
 

455
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,950
so if i click on that i can see the ip
address of that server it is i've called

456
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
address of that server it is i've called
 

457
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,629
address of that server it is i've called
it proxy server but right now

458
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
it proxy server but right now
 

459
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,390
it proxy server but right now
remember it's just debian 10. there's

460
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
remember it's just debian 10. there's
 

461
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,990
remember it's just debian 10. there's
nothing else installed on it

462
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
nothing else installed on it
 

463
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,110
nothing else installed on it
so i need to copy that ip address

464
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
so i need to copy that ip address
 

465
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,749
so i need to copy that ip address
and then i'm going to jump into my

and then i'm going to jump into my
 

467
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,749
and then i'm going to jump into my

important so
 

729
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,629
important so
let's do that just to be in good

730

let's do that just to be in good
security practices so

732
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
security practices so
 

733
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,949
security practices so

change it to my ip
 

741
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,310
change it to my ip
then i'm going to add a new rule you saw

742
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
then i'm going to add a new rule you saw
 

743

proxy and then save my rules
 

763
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,189
proxy and then save my rules
there we go so now you see ssh and

764
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
there we go so now you see ssh and
 

765
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,629
there we go so now you see ssh and
custom tcp

766

one called proxy on port 8888
 

769
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,030
one called proxy on port 8888
so how do we test this okay so our

770
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
so how do we test this okay so our
 

771
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,790
so how do we test this okay so our
current ip address is 99.233

so i'm going to simply type in proxy
 

827
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,550
so i'm going to simply type in proxy
and go into proxy settings again this is
