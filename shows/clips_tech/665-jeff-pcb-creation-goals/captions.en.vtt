okay<00:02:10.720><c> it's</c><00:02:11.280><c> actually</c><00:02:11.920><c> not</c><00:02:12.239><c> that</c><00:02:12.480><c> difficult</c>

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
okay it's actually not that difficult
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.150 align:start position:0%

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.869 align:start position:0%
simple process so i've found
i've<00:02:33.680><c> done</c><00:02:33.840><c> a</c><00:02:33.920><c> bunch</c><00:02:34.080><c> of</c><00:02:34.160><c> research</c><00:02:34.560><c> into</c><00:02:34.800><c> it</c>

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 align:start position:0%
i've done a bunch of research into it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
and you know my approach is a little bit
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.229 align:start position:0%
and you know my approach is a little bit

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
and then increase my investment in
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.110 align:start position:0%
and then increase my investment in

that will function like a pcb but then
 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.869 align:start position:0%
that will function like a pcb but then
you<00:03:49.280><c> can</c><00:03:49.440><c> just</c><00:03:49.519><c> take</c><00:03:49.680><c> it</c><00:03:49.840><c> all</c><00:03:50.000><c> apart</c><00:03:50.319><c> and</c>

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
you can just take it all apart and
 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.550 align:start position:0%
you can just take it all apart and
put<00:03:51.040><c> the</c><00:03:51.120><c> parts</c><00:03:51.440><c> away</c><00:03:51.840><c> right</c><00:03:53.280><c> and</c><00:03:53.439><c> it's</c><00:03:53.760><c> cheap</c>

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
put the parts away right and it's cheap
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.309 align:start position:0%
put the parts away right and it's cheap
very<00:03:54.799><c> cheap</c><00:03:55.120><c> and</c><00:03:55.280><c> it</c><00:03:55.360><c> just</c><00:03:55.519><c> gets</c><00:03:55.680><c> you</c><00:03:55.840><c> started</c>

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
very cheap and it just gets you started
 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.229 align:start position:0%
very cheap and it just gets you started
and<00:03:56.400><c> then</c><00:03:56.560><c> the</c><00:03:56.799><c> next</c><00:03:57.040><c> step</c><00:03:57.360><c> for</c><00:03:57.519><c> me</c><00:03:57.760><c> is</c><00:03:58.000><c> what's</c>

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
and then the next step for me is what's
 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
and then the next step for me is what's
called<00:03:58.400><c> a</c><00:03:58.480><c> prototyping</c><00:03:59.200><c> board</c><00:03:59.439><c> so</c><00:03:59.599><c> you</c><00:03:59.760><c> get</c>

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
called a prototyping board so you get
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.309 align:start position:0%
called a prototyping board so you get
pcb<00:04:00.560><c> boards</c><00:04:00.879><c> that</c><00:04:01.360><c> have</c><00:04:01.599><c> all</c><00:04:01.680><c> the</c><00:04:01.840><c> holes</c>

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
pcb boards that have all the holes
 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
pcb boards that have all the holes
that's<00:04:02.480><c> right</c><00:04:02.959><c> and</c><00:04:03.120><c> they've</c><00:04:03.360><c> got</c><00:04:03.599><c> solder</c>

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's right and they've got solder
 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
that's right and they've got solder
um<00:04:05.120><c> like</c><00:04:05.840><c> points</c><00:04:06.720><c> but</c><00:04:07.040><c> there's</c><00:04:07.360><c> no</c>

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
um like points but there's no
 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
um like points but there's no
interconnection<00:04:08.480><c> between</c><00:04:08.799><c> them</c><00:04:08.959><c> so</c><00:04:09.519><c> you</c>

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
interconnection between them so you
 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.949 align:start position:0%
interconnection between them so you
actually<00:04:10.000><c> run</c><00:04:10.319><c> wires</c>

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
actually run wires
 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.030 align:start position:0%
actually run wires
or<00:04:11.200><c> you</c><00:04:11.920><c> run</c><00:04:12.159><c> a</c><00:04:12.239><c> little</c><00:04:12.400><c> bit</c><00:04:12.560><c> of</c><00:04:12.640><c> solder</c>

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
or you run a little bit of solder
 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.589 align:start position:0%
or you run a little bit of solder
between<00:04:13.599><c> two</c><00:04:13.760><c> different</c><00:04:14.080><c> joints</c><00:04:14.480><c> for</c><00:04:14.720><c> example</c>

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
between two different joints for example
 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.270 align:start position:0%
between two different joints for example
and<00:04:15.920><c> you</c><00:04:16.079><c> do</c><00:04:16.239><c> it</c><00:04:16.320><c> that</c><00:04:16.479><c> way</c><00:04:16.639><c> so</c><00:04:16.799><c> that's</c><00:04:17.040><c> my</c>

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
and you do it that way so that's my
 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.909 align:start position:0%
and you do it that way so that's my
second<00:04:17.680><c> step</c><00:04:18.160><c> yes</c><00:04:18.479><c> then</c><00:04:18.880><c> i</c><00:04:19.120><c> would</c><00:04:19.280><c> look</c><00:04:19.519><c> at</c>

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
second step yes then i would look at
 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.710 align:start position:0%
second step yes then i would look at
maybe<00:04:20.959><c> going</c><00:04:21.280><c> the</c><00:04:21.359><c> route</c><00:04:21.680><c> of</c><00:04:22.320><c> actually</c>

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
maybe going the route of actually
 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.550 align:start position:0%
maybe going the route of actually
etching<00:04:23.199><c> your</c><00:04:23.440><c> own</c>

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.550 align:start position:0%
the and i'm i haven't researched it but
um

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
um
it's<00:04:32.800><c> a</c><00:04:32.960><c> much</c><00:04:33.280><c> more</c><00:04:33.600><c> intricate</c><00:04:34.240><c> process</c><00:04:34.639><c> so</c><00:04:34.800><c> i</c>

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's a much more intricate process so i
 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
it's a much more intricate process so i
like<00:04:35.120><c> to</c><00:04:35.360><c> start</c>

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.749 align:start position:0%

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
built on a breadboard
very<00:04:39.600><c> very</c><00:04:39.840><c> basic</c><00:04:40.400><c> but</c><00:04:40.639><c> i</c><00:04:40.720><c> designed</c><00:04:41.199><c> it</c><00:04:41.680><c> right</c>

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
very very basic but i designed it right
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.629 align:start position:0%
very very basic but i designed it right
okay

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.030 align:start position:0%
okay
and<00:04:43.199><c> all</c><00:04:43.440><c> it</c><00:04:43.600><c> is</c><00:04:43.840><c> is</c><00:04:44.000><c> it</c><00:04:44.080><c> takes</c><00:04:44.320><c> a</c><00:04:44.400><c> five</c><00:04:44.720><c> volt</c>

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
and all it is is it takes a five volt
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.749 align:start position:0%
and all it is is it takes a five volt
signal

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
signal
 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.350 align:start position:0%
signal
and<00:04:46.080><c> when</c><00:04:46.479><c> it</c><00:04:46.639><c> has</c><00:04:47.040><c> five</c><00:04:47.360><c> volts</c><00:04:48.400><c> the</c><00:04:48.720><c> relay</c><00:04:49.199><c> is</c>

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
and when it has five volts the relay is
 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.070 align:start position:0%
and when it has five volts the relay is
closed

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
closed
 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.909 align:start position:0%
closed
so<00:04:50.240><c> it</c><00:04:50.320><c> has</c><00:04:50.479><c> a</c><00:04:50.560><c> relay</c><00:04:50.960><c> right</c><00:04:51.199><c> okay</c><00:04:51.600><c> when</c><00:04:51.759><c> it</c>

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
so it has a relay right okay when it
 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
so it has a relay right okay when it
does<00:04:52.160><c> not</c><00:04:52.400><c> have</c><00:04:52.720><c> five</c><00:04:52.960><c> volts</c><00:04:53.280><c> the</c><00:04:53.440><c> relay</c><00:04:53.840><c> opens</c>

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
does not have five volts the relay opens
 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
does not have five volts the relay opens
so<00:04:55.120><c> it</c><00:04:55.440><c> disconnects</c><00:04:56.639><c> so</c><00:04:57.360><c> the</c><00:04:57.600><c> reason</c><00:04:57.840><c> that</c><00:04:57.919><c> i</c>

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it disconnects so the reason that i
 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.950 align:start position:0%
so it disconnects so the reason that i
created<00:04:58.479><c> that</c>

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a purpose-built application so i
 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.390 align:start position:0%

right<00:06:00.720><c> so</c><00:06:01.120><c> that</c><00:06:01.280><c> was</c><00:06:01.440><c> the</c><00:06:01.600><c> circuit</c><00:06:01.840><c> i</c><00:06:01.919><c> built</c><00:06:02.160><c> so</c>

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
right so that was the circuit i built so
 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
right so that was the circuit i built so
i<00:06:02.479><c> built</c><00:06:02.720><c> that</c><00:06:02.880><c> on</c><00:06:03.039><c> a</c><00:06:03.120><c> prototyping</c><00:06:03.759><c> board</c><00:06:04.000><c> once</c>

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
i built that on a prototyping board once
 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.469 align:start position:0%
i built that on a prototyping board once
i<00:06:04.560><c> had</c><00:06:04.720><c> it</c><00:06:04.880><c> working</c><00:06:05.520><c> and</c><00:06:05.680><c> i</c><00:06:05.759><c> just</c><00:06:05.919><c> soldered</c><00:06:06.319><c> it</c>

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
i had it working and i just soldered it
 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.070 align:start position:0%
i had it working and i just soldered it
together<00:06:06.800><c> and</c><00:06:06.960><c> it's</c><00:06:07.039><c> a</c><00:06:07.280><c> very</c><00:06:07.520><c> very</c><00:06:07.759><c> simple</c>

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
and everything an arduino is like you
 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:52.469 align:start position:0%
and everything an arduino is like you
just<00:07:51.280><c> program</c><00:07:51.759><c> it</c><00:07:51.919><c> to</c><00:07:52.080><c> do</c>

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
just program it to do
 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
just program it to do
a<00:07:52.720><c> very</c><00:07:52.960><c> specific</c><00:07:53.520><c> task</c><00:07:54.000><c> it's</c><00:07:54.160><c> a</c><00:07:54.240><c> solid</c><00:07:54.639><c> state</c>

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
a very specific task it's a solid state
 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.909 align:start position:0%
a very specific task it's a solid state
and

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
and
 

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:58.790 align:start position:0%
and
it<00:07:56.080><c> will</c><00:07:56.560><c> respond</c><00:07:57.280><c> to</c><00:07:58.240><c> and</c><00:07:58.319><c> i</c><00:07:58.400><c> think</c><00:07:58.560><c> this</c><00:07:58.720><c> is</c>

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
it will respond to and i think this is
 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.869 align:start position:0%
it will respond to and i think this is
why<00:07:59.039><c> it</c><00:07:59.120><c> would</c><00:07:59.280><c> work</c><00:07:59.520><c> really</c><00:07:59.840><c> well</c><00:08:00.080><c> an</c><00:08:00.240><c> arduino</c>

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
why it would work really well an arduino
 

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.749 align:start position:0%
why it would work really well an arduino
for

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
for
 

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
for
uh<00:08:02.479><c> for</c><00:08:03.440><c> a</c><00:08:03.599><c> useless</c><00:08:04.000><c> box</c><00:08:04.639><c> is</c><00:08:04.720><c> because</c><00:08:05.039><c> it's</c>

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh for a useless box is because it's
 

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
uh for a useless box is because it's
like

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:07.189 align:start position:0%
like
it's<00:08:05.759><c> either</c><00:08:06.080><c> on</c><00:08:06.240><c> or</c><00:08:06.400><c> off</c><00:08:06.639><c> that's</c><00:08:06.879><c> right</c><00:08:07.039><c> and</c>

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's either on or off that's right and
 

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.029 align:start position:0%
it's either on or off that's right and
if<00:08:07.360><c> it's</c><00:08:07.599><c> on</c><00:08:08.400><c> do</c><00:08:08.560><c> this</c>

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
if it's on do this
 

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
if it's on do this
and<00:08:09.199><c> then</c><00:08:10.080><c> it</c><00:08:10.160><c> will</c><00:08:10.319><c> turn</c><00:08:10.560><c> off</c><00:08:10.960><c> that's</c><00:08:11.120><c> right</c>

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then it will turn off that's right
 

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.110 align:start position:0%
and then it will turn off that's right
so<00:08:11.520><c> very</c><00:08:11.759><c> very</c><00:08:12.000><c> basic</c><00:08:12.319><c> programming</c>

now<00:08:26.960><c> what</c><00:08:27.120><c> do</c><00:08:27.199><c> you</c><00:08:27.280><c> think</c><00:08:27.599><c> high</c><00:08:27.919><c> means</c><00:08:28.479><c> versus</c>

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
now what do you think high means versus
 

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
now what do you think high means versus
low

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
low
 

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.029 align:start position:0%
low
which<00:08:29.680><c> is</c><00:08:29.840><c> what</c><00:08:29.919><c> i'm</c><00:08:30.080><c> going</c><00:08:30.160><c> to</c><00:08:30.240><c> put</c><00:08:30.400><c> here</c><00:08:30.800><c> just</c>

00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
which is what i'm going to put here just
 

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.589 align:start position:0%
which is what i'm going to put here just
a<00:08:31.120><c> guess</c><00:08:32.000><c> on</c><00:08:32.320><c> or</c><00:08:32.560><c> off</c>

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
a guess on or off
 

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.709 align:start position:0%
a guess on or off
yes<00:08:34.479><c> so</c><00:08:34.719><c> that's</c><00:08:35.039><c> what</c><00:08:35.279><c> my</c><00:08:35.839><c> circuit</c><00:08:36.159><c> now</c><00:08:36.399><c> looks</c>

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
yes so that's what my circuit now looks
 

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:37.269 align:start position:0%
yes so that's what my circuit now looks
like

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:40.469 align:start position:0%
like

that's<00:11:10.240><c> way</c><00:11:10.480><c> more</c><00:11:10.720><c> advanced</c><00:11:11.200><c> but</c><00:11:11.360><c> that's</c>

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's way more advanced but that's
 

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.949 align:start position:0%
that's way more advanced but that's
probably<00:11:11.920><c> the</c><00:11:12.000><c> only</c><00:11:12.240><c> thing</c><00:11:12.480><c> i</c><00:11:12.560><c> can</c><00:11:12.640><c> think</c><00:11:12.880><c> of</c>

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
probably the only thing i can think of
 

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
probably the only thing i can think of
where<00:11:13.120><c> i'm</c><00:11:13.279><c> like</c><00:11:13.519><c> i</c><00:11:13.680><c> want</c><00:11:13.839><c> to</c><00:11:13.920><c> do</c><00:11:14.079><c> this</c><00:11:14.320><c> but</c><00:11:14.480><c> see</c>

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
where i'm like i want to do this but see
 

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.990 align:start position:0%
where i'm like i want to do this but see
you<00:11:14.800><c> talk</c><00:11:15.040><c> about</c><00:11:15.279><c> that</c><00:11:15.440><c> and</c><00:11:15.519><c> then</c><00:11:15.680><c> i</c><00:11:15.760><c> think</c>

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
you talk about that and then i think
 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.790 align:start position:0%
you talk about that and then i think
okay<00:11:16.240><c> well</c>

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay well
 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
okay well
you<00:11:16.959><c> could</c><00:11:17.120><c> use</c><00:11:17.279><c> a</c><00:11:17.360><c> passive</c><00:11:17.760><c> infrared</c><00:11:18.240><c> sensor</c>

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
you could use a passive infrared sensor
 

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.269 align:start position:0%
you could use a passive infrared sensor
yep<00:11:19.120><c> which</c><00:11:19.360><c> is</c><00:11:19.519><c> used</c><00:11:19.760><c> in</c><00:11:19.920><c> motion</c><00:11:20.320><c> sensors</c>

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
yep which is used in motion sensors
 

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
yep which is used in motion sensors
you<00:11:21.440><c> could</c><00:11:21.600><c> use</c><00:11:22.240><c> a</c><00:11:22.399><c> laser</c><00:11:22.880><c> sensor</c><00:11:24.000><c> but</c>

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
you could use a laser sensor but
 

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.670 align:start position:0%
you could use a laser sensor but
pir<00:11:25.279><c> is</c><00:11:25.680><c> very</c><00:11:25.920><c> very</c><00:11:26.160><c> cheap</c><00:11:26.640><c> yes</c><00:11:27.200><c> yeah</c><00:11:27.440><c> and</c><00:11:27.600><c> it's</c>

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's
 

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.269 align:start position:0%
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's
just<00:11:27.839><c> a</c><00:11:27.920><c> little</c><00:11:28.079><c> sensor</c><00:11:28.399><c> that</c><00:11:28.560><c> it's</c><00:11:28.800><c> like</c><00:11:29.040><c> okay</c>

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
just a little sensor that it's like okay
 

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:30.069 align:start position:0%
just a little sensor that it's like okay
there<00:11:29.440><c> was</c><00:11:29.600><c> motion</c>

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
there was motion
 

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:31.990 align:start position:0%
there was motion
do<00:11:30.320><c> something</c><00:11:30.959><c> yeah</c><00:11:31.200><c> so</c><00:11:31.440><c> you</c><00:11:31.519><c> could</c><00:11:31.680><c> create</c>

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
do something yeah so you could create
 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.470 align:start position:0%
do something yeah so you could create
something<00:11:32.720><c> again</c><00:11:33.040><c> with</c><00:11:33.200><c> a</c><00:11:33.360><c> relay</c>

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
something again with a relay
 

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.949 align:start position:0%
something again with a relay
that<00:11:35.040><c> controls</c><00:11:35.600><c> just</c><00:11:35.920><c> whether</c><00:11:36.160><c> the</c><00:11:36.320><c> speaker</c>

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
that controls just whether the speaker
 

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.190 align:start position:0%
that controls just whether the speaker
has<00:11:37.360><c> a</c><00:11:37.519><c> completed</c><00:11:38.000><c> circuit</c><00:11:38.399><c> or</c><00:11:38.480><c> not</c>

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
has a completed circuit or not
 

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.829 align:start position:0%
has a completed circuit or not
yeah<00:11:39.519><c> so</c><00:11:39.680><c> if</c><00:11:39.760><c> it</c><00:11:39.839><c> was</c><00:11:40.000><c> just</c><00:11:40.240><c> a</c><00:11:41.519><c> bunch</c><00:11:41.760><c> of</c>

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so if it was just a bunch of
 

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.990 align:start position:0%
yeah so if it was just a bunch of
speakers<00:11:42.320><c> connected</c><00:11:42.720><c> through</c><00:11:42.880><c> an</c><00:11:43.040><c> amplifier</c>

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
speakers connected through an amplifier
 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.870 align:start position:0%
speakers connected through an amplifier
you<00:11:44.160><c> could</c><00:11:44.320><c> have</c><00:11:44.560><c> relays</c><00:11:45.120><c> set</c><00:11:45.440><c> up</c><00:11:46.000><c> with</c><00:11:46.240><c> pir</c>

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
you could have relays set up with pir
 

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.710 align:start position:0%
you could have relays set up with pir
sensors<00:11:47.279><c> that</c><00:11:47.519><c> you'd</c><00:11:47.680><c> be</c><00:11:47.839><c> able</c><00:11:47.920><c> to</c><00:11:48.079><c> control</c><00:11:48.480><c> by</c>

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
sensors that you'd be able to control by
 

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.829 align:start position:0%
sensors that you'd be able to control by
motion

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
motion
 

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
motion
yeah<00:11:50.399><c> good</c><00:11:50.639><c> and</c><00:11:50.800><c> if</c><00:11:50.880><c> there's</c><00:11:51.120><c> no</c><00:11:51.360><c> motion</c><00:11:52.000><c> for</c>

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
yeah good and if there's no motion for
 

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.069 align:start position:0%
yeah good and if there's no motion for
10<00:11:52.639><c> minutes</c><00:11:53.040><c> turn</c><00:11:53.279><c> off</c><00:11:53.360><c> the</c><00:11:53.519><c> speaker</c>

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
10 minutes turn off the speaker
 

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.190 align:start position:0%
10 minutes turn off the speaker
automatically<00:11:54.639><c> or</c><00:11:54.800><c> something</c><00:11:55.040><c> like</c><00:11:55.120><c> that</c>

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
automatically or something like that
 

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
automatically or something like that
yeah

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
yeah
exactly<00:11:56.000><c> so</c><00:11:56.399><c> like</c><00:11:56.639><c> these</c><00:11:56.800><c> kinds</c><00:11:57.040><c> of</c><00:11:57.200><c> ideas</c>

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
exactly so like these kinds of ideas
 

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.110 align:start position:0%
exactly so like these kinds of ideas
like<00:11:57.760><c> there's</c><00:11:58.000><c> so</c><00:11:58.160><c> much</c><00:11:58.399><c> stuff</c><00:11:58.639><c> that</c><00:11:58.800><c> you</c><00:11:58.880><c> can</c>

00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
like there's so much stuff that you can
 

00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
like there's so much stuff that you can
do

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
do
 

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:01.190 align:start position:0%
do
when<00:12:00.000><c> you</c><00:12:00.160><c> start</c><00:12:00.399><c> to</c><00:12:00.480><c> understand</c><00:12:00.959><c> and</c><00:12:01.040><c> then</c>

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
when you start to understand and then
 

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
when you start to understand and then
there's<00:12:01.440><c> the</c><00:12:01.519><c> whole</c><00:12:01.680><c> flip</c><00:12:01.920><c> side</c><00:12:02.160><c> of</c><00:12:02.320><c> it</c><00:12:02.399><c> where</c>

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's the whole flip side of it where
 

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.670 align:start position:0%
there's the whole flip side of it where
something<00:12:03.440><c> breaks</c><00:12:03.760><c> and</c><00:12:03.839><c> you</c><00:12:04.000><c> can</c><00:12:04.240><c> fix</c><00:12:04.560><c> it</c><00:12:04.800><c> yes</c>

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
something breaks and you can fix it yes
 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.269 align:start position:0%
something breaks and you can fix it yes
that's<00:12:06.000><c> a</c><00:12:06.079><c> good</c><00:12:06.320><c> feeling</c>

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
that's a good feeling
 

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:09.110 align:start position:0%
that's a good feeling
and<00:12:07.360><c> that's</c><00:12:07.519><c> done</c><00:12:07.920><c> we've</c><00:12:08.160><c> done</c><00:12:08.399><c> that</c><00:12:08.639><c> already</c>

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that's done we've done that already
 

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
and that's done we've done that already
yeah<00:12:09.519><c> nice</c><00:12:10.160><c> so</c>

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
yeah nice so
 

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.910 align:start position:0%
yeah nice so
you<00:12:10.880><c> know</c><00:12:11.040><c> you</c><00:12:11.120><c> get</c><00:12:11.279><c> those</c><00:12:11.440><c> little</c><00:12:11.519><c> battery</c>

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know you get those little battery
 

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
you know you get those little battery
testers<00:12:13.200><c> uh</c><00:12:13.519><c> like</c><00:12:13.680><c> to</c><00:12:13.920><c> check</c><00:12:14.160><c> the</c><00:12:14.240><c> charge</c>

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
testers uh like to check the charge
 

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
testers uh like to check the charge
yeah<00:12:15.279><c> so</c><00:12:15.440><c> we</c><00:12:15.519><c> had</c><00:12:15.760><c> one</c><00:12:15.920><c> of</c><00:12:16.000><c> those</c><00:12:16.399><c> and</c><00:12:16.959><c> it's</c>

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so we had one of those and it's
 

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.310 align:start position:0%
yeah so we had one of those and it's
funny<00:12:17.360><c> when</c><00:12:17.519><c> my</c><00:12:17.600><c> son</c><00:12:17.839><c> was</c><00:12:17.920><c> building</c><00:12:18.240><c> his</c>

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
funny when my son was building his
 

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
funny when my son was building his
calculator<00:12:19.040><c> we</c><00:12:19.200><c> weren't</c><00:12:19.440><c> sure</c><00:12:19.600><c> if</c><00:12:19.680><c> the</c>

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
calculator we weren't sure if the
 

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.110 align:start position:0%
calculator we weren't sure if the
batteries<00:12:20.079><c> were</c><00:12:20.240><c> working</c><00:12:20.560><c> and</c><00:12:20.800><c> we</c><00:12:20.880><c> weren't</c>

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
batteries were working and we weren't
 

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.389 align:start position:0%
batteries were working and we weren't
getting<00:12:21.440><c> anything</c>

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
getting anything
 

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
getting anything
i'm<00:12:22.560><c> like</c><00:12:22.720><c> this</c><00:12:22.880><c> is</c><00:12:23.040><c> odd</c><00:12:23.279><c> that</c><00:12:23.519><c> we're</c><00:12:23.600><c> not</c>

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm like this is odd that we're not
