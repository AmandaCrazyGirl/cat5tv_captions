00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,030

our son has

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
our son has
 

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,230
our son has
gotten into soldering and he's done very

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
gotten into soldering and he's done very
 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,230
gotten into soldering and he's done very
well at it and remind us how old is he

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
well at it and remind us how old is he
 

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,830
well at it and remind us how old is he
just turning 12. just turned 12. all

8
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
just turning 12. just turned 12. all
 

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,749
just turning 12. just turned 12. all
right um

10

but yeah he's done very well with it and
 

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,430
but yeah he's done very well with it and
uh

14
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
uh
 

15
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,230
uh
he's soldered two calculators so far um

16
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
he's soldered two calculators so far um
 

17
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,910
he's soldered two calculators so far um
and one of them he's taken to school

18
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
and one of them he's taken to school
 

19
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,830
and one of them he's taken to school
which his teacher was completely blown

20
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
which his teacher was completely blown
 

21
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,589
which his teacher was completely blown
away by yeah i'm thinking 12 years old

22
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
away by yeah i'm thinking 12 years old
 

23
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,029
away by yeah i'm thinking 12 years old
and he's already making a calculator

24
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
and he's already making a calculator
 

25
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,710
and he's already making a calculator
yeah yeah he made a calculator we got a

26
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
yeah yeah he made a calculator we got a
 

27
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,150
yeah yeah he made a calculator we got a
diy kit from

28
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
diy kit from
 

29
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,790
diy kit from
amazon and he built it and it maybe two

30
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
amazon and he built it and it maybe two
 

31
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,270
amazon and he built it and it maybe two
hours

32
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
hours
 

33
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,350
hours
of work it was really phenomenal unreal

34
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
of work it was really phenomenal unreal
 

35
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,870
of work it was really phenomenal unreal
and his soldering job is

36
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
and his soldering job is
 

37
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,510
and his soldering job is
really really clean excellent like looks

38
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
really really clean excellent like looks
 

39
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,709
really really clean excellent like looks

pro
 

41
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,790
pro
but anyway he's been asking how to do

42
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
but anyway he's been asking how to do
 

43
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,389
but anyway he's been asking how to do
other stuff and as we're soldering he's

44
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
other stuff and as we're soldering he's
 

45
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:44,630
other stuff and as we're soldering he's
like

46
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
like
 

47
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,470
like
what's this and what's this and how's

48
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
what's this and what's this and how's
 

49
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,310
what's this and what's this and how's
that work and i'm going

50
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
that work and i'm going
 

51
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,670
that work and i'm going
i want to be able to teach him these

52
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
i want to be able to teach him these
 

53
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,590
i want to be able to teach him these
things i want to be able to

54
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
things i want to be able to
 

55
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,470
things i want to be able to
explain to him how a circuit board

56
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
explain to him how a circuit board
 

57
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,510
explain to him how a circuit board
actually works

58
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
actually works
 

59
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,670
actually works
not just soldering it but understanding

60
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
not just soldering it but understanding
 

61
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,110
not just soldering it but understanding
the components and the routing and all

62
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
the components and the routing and all
 

63
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,069
the components and the routing and all
that kind of stuff

64
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
that kind of stuff
 

65
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,189
that kind of stuff
and i mean i know you can buy um

66
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
and i mean i know you can buy um
 

67
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,910
and i mean i know you can buy um
just plain boards that are just rows of

68
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
just plain boards that are just rows of
 

69
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,469
just plain boards that are just rows of
of of little connection points but i

70
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
of of little connection points but i
 

71
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,990
of of little connection points but i
want to be able to make our own board

72
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
want to be able to make our own board
 

73
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,789
want to be able to make our own board
yeah and so he's asked specifically if

74
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
yeah and so he's asked specifically if
 

75
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,469
yeah and so he's asked specifically if
we can find a diy kit

76
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
we can find a diy kit
 

77
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,550
we can find a diy kit
for a useless box you know that's the

78
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
for a useless box you know that's the
 

79
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,070
for a useless box you know that's the
box when you push the button yeah

80
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
box when you push the button yeah
 

81
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,429
box when you push the button yeah
the little thing comes out and pops it

82
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
the little thing comes out and pops it
 

83
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,510
the little thing comes out and pops it
yeah give it a try

84
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
yeah give it a try
 

85
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,590
yeah give it a try
what do you do are you serious

86
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600

 

87
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,550

oh my gosh that is hilarious

88
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560

 

89
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,310

hello it's like having a kitten in there

90
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
hello it's like having a kitten in there
 

91
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,069
hello it's like having a kitten in there
it's like my cat

92
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079

 

93
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,109

hey hey now so i've been looking for one

94
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
hey hey now so i've been looking for one
 

95
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,630
hey hey now so i've been looking for one
haven't found one but i found a bunch of

96
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
haven't found one but i found a bunch of
 

97
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,149
haven't found one but i found a bunch of
people like oh you can make one using an

98
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
people like oh you can make one using an
 

99
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,990
people like oh you can make one using an
arduino you can make one using this

100
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
arduino you can make one using this
 

101
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,230
arduino you can make one using this
and i was like if i'm gonna do a diy

102
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
and i was like if i'm gonna do a diy
 

103
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,350
and i was like if i'm gonna do a diy
box useless box i want to build it from

104
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
box useless box i want to build it from
 

105
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,789
box useless box i want to build it from
the ground up

106
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
the ground up
 

107
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,630
the ground up
so i've been researching how to make my

108
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
so i've been researching how to make my
 

109
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,990
so i've been researching how to make my
own pcbs at home

110
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
own pcbs at home
 

111
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,589
own pcbs at home
okay it's actually not that difficult

112
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
okay it's actually not that difficult
 

113
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,150
okay it's actually not that difficult
and i was blown away that all i need is

114
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
and i was blown away that all i need is
 

115
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,790
and i was blown away that all i need is
a laser printer to set my routing

116
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
a laser printer to set my routing
 

117
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,430
a laser printer to set my routing
like where the paths go so you're going

118
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
like where the paths go so you're going
 

119
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,990
like where the paths go so you're going
to actually

120
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
to actually
 

121
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,550
to actually
etch it i'm going to actually etch it at

122
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
etch it i'm going to actually etch it at
 

123
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,750
etch it i'm going to actually etch it at
home oh man

124
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
home oh man
 

125
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,229
home oh man
that's way beyond me jeff it's really

126
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
that's way beyond me jeff it's really
 

127
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,030
that's way beyond me jeff it's really
that involves

128
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
that involves
 

129
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,990
that involves
chemicals it does but but a really

130
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
chemicals it does but but a really
 

131
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,509
chemicals it does but but a really
simple process so i've found

132
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
simple process so i've found
 

133
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,869
simple process so i've found
i've done a bunch of research into it

134
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
i've done a bunch of research into it
 

135
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,710
i've done a bunch of research into it
and so i found a

136
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
and so i found a
 

137
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,550
and so i found a
really simple easy way to make my own

138
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
really simple easy way to make my own
 

139
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,750
really simple easy way to make my own
pcb

140
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
pcb
 

141
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,030
pcb
and that's what we're going to be doing

142
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
and that's what we're going to be doing
 

143
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,630
and that's what we're going to be doing
so my project for the next probably a

144
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
so my project for the next probably a
 

145
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,750
so my project for the next probably a
couple of months

146
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
couple of months
 

147
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,509
couple of months
because i have to learn how this stuff

148
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
because i have to learn how this stuff
 

149
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,949
because i have to learn how this stuff
works is to design a circuit board

150
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
works is to design a circuit board
 

151
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,869
works is to design a circuit board
which i've never done before make the

152
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
which i've never done before make the
 

153
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,990
which i've never done before make the
circuit board

154
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
circuit board
 

155
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,670
circuit board
and then my son's gonna solder it

156
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
and then my son's gonna solder it
 

157
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,830
and then my son's gonna solder it
together and we're gonna make our own

158
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
together and we're gonna make our own
 

159
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,030
together and we're gonna make our own
useless box that i'm hoping to also 3d

160
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
useless box that i'm hoping to also 3d
 

161
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,990
useless box that i'm hoping to also 3d
print the box as well

162
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
print the box as well
 

163
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,830
print the box as well
oh that's cool yeah you're just diving

164
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
oh that's cool yeah you're just diving
 

165
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,110
oh that's cool yeah you're just diving
right in i

166
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
right in i
 

167
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,309
right in i
when i do something i don't go small

168
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
when i do something i don't go small
 

169
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,750
when i do something i don't go small
and you know my approach is a little bit

170
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
and you know my approach is a little bit
 

171
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,229
and you know my approach is a little bit
different because i am very much

172
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
different because i am very much
 

173
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,390
different because i am very much
into like i like to learn something

174
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
into like i like to learn something
 

175
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,350
into like i like to learn something
first

176
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
first
 

177
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,710
first
and then increase my investment in

178
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
and then increase my investment in
 

179
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,110
and then increase my investment in
that process and and you're like talking

180
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
that process and and you're like talking
 

181
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,869
that process and and you're like talking
about jumping right to pcb

182
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
about jumping right to pcb
 

183
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,509
about jumping right to pcb
creation so i would back up so you know

184
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
creation so i would back up so you know
 

185
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,110
creation so i would back up so you know
if this is you thinking hey maybe i'd

186
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
if this is you thinking hey maybe i'd
 

187
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,630
if this is you thinking hey maybe i'd
like to be able to make my own circuits

188
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
like to be able to make my own circuits
 

189
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,910
like to be able to make my own circuits
and things like that

190
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
and things like that
 

191
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,229
and things like that
my starting point is a breadboard yes

192
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
my starting point is a breadboard yes
 

193
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,710
my starting point is a breadboard yes
and the breadboard allows you to lay out

194
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
and the breadboard allows you to lay out
 

195
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,270
and the breadboard allows you to lay out
your circuit that you've designed or

196
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
your circuit that you've designed or
 

197
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,910
your circuit that you've designed or
that you've

198
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
that you've
 

199
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,550
that you've
downloaded like a circuit blueprint from

200
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
downloaded like a circuit blueprint from
 

201
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,830
downloaded like a circuit blueprint from
the internet or however

202
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
the internet or however
 

203
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,229
the internet or however
however you've got that lets you lay it

204
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
however you've got that lets you lay it
 

205
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,869
however you've got that lets you lay it
out on a

206
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
out on a
 

207
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,630
out on a
on a basically a mock pcb

208
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
on a basically a mock pcb
 

209
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,190
on a basically a mock pcb
that will function like a pcb but then

210
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
that will function like a pcb but then
 

211
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,869
that will function like a pcb but then
you can just take it all apart and

212
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
you can just take it all apart and
 

213
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,550
you can just take it all apart and
put the parts away right and it's cheap

214
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
put the parts away right and it's cheap
 

215
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,309
put the parts away right and it's cheap
very cheap and it just gets you started

216
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
very cheap and it just gets you started
 

217
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,229
very cheap and it just gets you started
and then the next step for me is what's

218
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
and then the next step for me is what's
 

219
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,990
and then the next step for me is what's
called a prototyping board so you get

220
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
called a prototyping board so you get
 

221
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,309
called a prototyping board so you get
pcb boards that have all the holes

222
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
pcb boards that have all the holes
 

223
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,390
pcb boards that have all the holes
that's right and they've got solder

224
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
that's right and they've got solder
 

225
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,750
that's right and they've got solder
um like points but there's no

226
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
um like points but there's no
 

227
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,670
um like points but there's no
interconnection between them so you

228
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
interconnection between them so you
 

229
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,949
interconnection between them so you
actually run wires

230
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
actually run wires
 

231
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,030
actually run wires
or you run a little bit of solder

232
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
or you run a little bit of solder
 

233
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,589
or you run a little bit of solder
between two different joints for example

234
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
between two different joints for example
 

235
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,270
between two different joints for example
and you do it that way so that's my

236
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
and you do it that way so that's my
 

237
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,909
and you do it that way so that's my
second step yes then i would look at

238
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
second step yes then i would look at
 

239
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,710
second step yes then i would look at
maybe going the route of actually

240
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
maybe going the route of actually
 

241
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,550
maybe going the route of actually
etching your own

242
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
etching your own
 

243
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,430
etching your own
pcbs because then you're getting into

244
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
pcbs because then you're getting into
 

245
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,110
pcbs because then you're getting into
like the chemical processes

246
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
like the chemical processes
 

247
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,070
like the chemical processes
the and i'm i haven't researched it but

248
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
the and i'm i haven't researched it but
 

249
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,550
the and i'm i haven't researched it but
um

250
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
um
 

251
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,950
um
it's a much more intricate process so i

252
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
it's a much more intricate process so i
 

253
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,830
it's a much more intricate process so i
like to start

254
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
like to start
 

255
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,749
like to start
a little bit simpler my first pcb i

256
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
a little bit simpler my first pcb i
 

257
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,350
a little bit simpler my first pcb i
built on a breadboard

258
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
built on a breadboard
 

259
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,990
built on a breadboard
very very basic but i designed it right

260
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
very very basic but i designed it right
 

261
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,629
very very basic but i designed it right
okay

262
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
okay
 

263
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,030
okay
and all it is is it takes a five volt

264
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
and all it is is it takes a five volt
 

265
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,749
and all it is is it takes a five volt
signal

266
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
signal
 

267
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,350
signal
and when it has five volts the relay is

268
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
and when it has five volts the relay is
 

269
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,070
and when it has five volts the relay is
closed

270
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
closed
 

271
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,909
closed
so it has a relay right okay when it

272
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
so it has a relay right okay when it
 

273
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,710
so it has a relay right okay when it
does not have five volts the relay opens

274
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
does not have five volts the relay opens
 

275
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,070
does not have five volts the relay opens
so it disconnects so the reason that i

276
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
so it disconnects so the reason that i
 

277
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,950
so it disconnects so the reason that i
created that

278
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
created that
 

279
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,950
created that
it's a purpose-built application so i

280
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
it's a purpose-built application so i
 

281
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,390
it's a purpose-built application so i
built it on a breadboard

282
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
built it on a breadboard
 

283
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,830
built it on a breadboard
and feeding at 5 volts is coming from

284
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
and feeding at 5 volts is coming from
 

285
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,070
and feeding at 5 volts is coming from
any guesses any guesses spc no

286
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
any guesses any guesses spc no
 

287
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,270
any guesses any guesses spc no
it's another three letter acronym usb uh

288
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
it's another three letter acronym usb uh
 

289
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,830

tick i programmed code that said
that basically to dumb it down if the

300
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
that basically to dumb it down if the
 

301
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,950
that basically to dumb it down if the
internet goes down

302
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
internet goes down
 

303
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,749
internet goes down
kill the power on the usb oh so then

304
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
kill the power on the usb oh so then
 

305
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,390
kill the power on the usb oh so then
that

306
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
that
 

307
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,629
that
opens up the relay and what is the relay

308
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
opens up the relay and what is the relay
 

309
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,590
opens up the relay and what is the relay
control but

310
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
control but
 

311
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,950
control but
the power to my modem so my modem

312
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
the power to my modem so my modem
 

313
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,550
the power to my modem so my modem
if the internet goes down will

314
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
if the internet goes down will
 

315
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,710
if the internet goes down will
automatically turn the power

316
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
automatically turn the power
 

317
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,590
automatically turn the power
of itself off because of my relay right

318
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
of itself off because of my relay right
 

319
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:43,990
of itself off because of my relay right
and

320
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
and
 

321
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,990
and
wait five seconds and then power back on

322
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
wait five seconds and then power back on
 

323
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,990
wait five seconds and then power back on
so it's essentially a virtual version

324
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
so it's essentially a virtual version
 

325
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,790
so it's essentially a virtual version
of did you turn it off and on again

326
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
of did you turn it off and on again
 

327
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,150
of did you turn it off and on again
because what do you do when you're in an

328
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
because what do you do when you're in an
 

329
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,510
because what do you do when you're in an
internet goes down you pull the plug

330
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
internet goes down you pull the plug
 

331
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,270
internet goes down you pull the plug
from the momentum you wait five seconds

332
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
from the momentum you wait five seconds
 

333
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,629
from the momentum you wait five seconds
and you plug it back in and

334
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
and you plug it back in and
 

335
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,309
and you plug it back in and
you know eight times out of ten it's

336
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
you know eight times out of ten it's
 

337
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,150
you know eight times out of ten it's
going to come back up and be working

338
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
going to come back up and be working
 

339
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,309
going to come back up and be working
right so that was the circuit i built so

340
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
right so that was the circuit i built so
 

341
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,390
right so that was the circuit i built so
i built that on a prototyping board once

342
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
i built that on a prototyping board once
 

343
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,469
i built that on a prototyping board once
i had it working and i just soldered it

344
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
i had it working and i just soldered it
 

345
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,070
i had it working and i just soldered it
together and it's a very very simple

346
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
together and it's a very very simple
 

347
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,550
together and it's a very very simple
circuit

348
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
circuit
 

349
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,629
circuit
very cool and it worked great i like

350
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
very cool and it worked great i like
 

351
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,830
very cool and it worked great i like
that

352
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
that
 

353
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,550
that
very cool so tools what have you got so

354
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
very cool so tools what have you got so
 

355
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,670
very cool so tools what have you got so
far where are you at

356
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
far where are you at
 

357
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,909
far where are you at
uh well like i said i've just been doing

358
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
uh well like i said i've just been doing
 

359
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,070
uh well like i said i've just been doing
the research this past week oh so

360
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
the research this past week oh so
 

361
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,670
the research this past week oh so
i'm um i'm at the buying stage

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
i'm um i'm at the buying stage
 

363
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,990
i'm um i'm at the buying stage
uh so we've got all the soldering stuff

364
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
uh so we've got all the soldering stuff
 

365
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,670
uh so we've got all the soldering stuff
i'm gonna be buying the board buying the

366
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
i'm gonna be buying the board buying the
 

367
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,629
i'm gonna be buying the board buying the
chemicals

chemicals
 

369
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,749
chemicals
i've already downloaded the um software

370
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
i've already downloaded the um software
 

371
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,390
i've already downloaded the um software
for

372
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
for
 

373
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,430
for
designing the pcb wow um

374
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
designing the pcb wow um
 

375
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,749
designing the pcb wow um
and i've got a component kit that's on

376
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
and i've got a component kit that's on
 

377
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,270
and i've got a component kit that's on
the way with all the

378
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
the way with all the
 

379
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,270
the way with all the
resistors and capacitors right yeah all

380
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
resistors and capacitors right yeah all
 

381
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,870
resistors and capacitors right yeah all
that kind of stuff that's a neat thing

382
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
that kind of stuff that's a neat thing
 

383
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,990
that kind of stuff that's a neat thing
too is that these

384
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
too is that these
 

385
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,390
too is that these
these days i mean you can't really walk

386
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
these days i mean you can't really walk
 

387
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,830
these days i mean you can't really walk
into a radio shack like we used to be

388
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
into a radio shack like we used to be
 

389
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,870
into a radio shack like we used to be
able to they're no

390
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
able to they're no
 

391
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,189
able to they're no
there are still stores like here in

392
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
there are still stores like here in
 

393
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,589
there are still stores like here in
barrie we have one called seaal

394
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
barrie we have one called seaal
 

395
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,510
barrie we have one called seaal
which is a brilliant store that's kind

396
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
which is a brilliant store that's kind
 

397
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,950
which is a brilliant store that's kind
of like that old radio shack where you

398
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
of like that old radio shack where you
 

399
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,430
of like that old radio shack where you
go in and

400
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
go in and
 

401
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,309
go in and
it's like i just need one capacitor yeah

402
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
it's like i just need one capacitor yeah
 

403
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,950
it's like i just need one capacitor yeah
and it's like

404
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
and it's like
 

405
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,309
and it's like
here you go yeah you know it's like

406
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
here you go yeah you know it's like
 

407
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,070
here you go yeah you know it's like
drawers and drawers of capacitors and

408
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
drawers and drawers of capacitors and
 

409
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,230
drawers and drawers of capacitors and
resistors and everything else diodes and

all the kind of like the common stuff
 

419
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,790
all the kind of like the common stuff
and it's a kit that comes with a

420
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
and it's a kit that comes with a
 

421
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,670
and it's a kit that comes with a
breadboard

422
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
breadboard
 

423
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,270
breadboard
and it comes with a breadboard and that

424
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
and it comes with a breadboard and that
 

425
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,510
and it comes with a breadboard and that
was one of the things is is i wanna like

426
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
was one of the things is is i wanna like
 

427
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,110
was one of the things is is i wanna like
yes i'm gonna be designing it but part

428
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
yes i'm gonna be designing it but part
 

429
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,550
yes i'm gonna be designing it but part
of the planning process

430
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
of the planning process
 

431
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,670
of the planning process
is just like you said using the

432
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
is just like you said using the
 

433
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,790
is just like you said using the
breadboard to figure out how the

434
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
breadboard to figure out how the
 

435
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,230
breadboard to figure out how the
circuitry is gonna go

436
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
circuitry is gonna go
 

437
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,430
circuitry is gonna go
that's gonna be a great learning

438
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
that's gonna be a great learning
 

439
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,629
that's gonna be a great learning
experience for luke because they'll be

440
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
experience for luke because they'll be
 

441
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,670
experience for luke because they'll be
like hey this is

442
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
like hey this is
 

443
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,189
like hey this is
how does this work and let's try this

444
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
how does this work and let's try this
 

445
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,110
how does this work and let's try this
and let's do that and then

446
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
and let's do that and then
 

447
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,390
and let's do that and then
you know we'll be able to trial an error

448
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
you know we'll be able to trial an error
 

449
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,909
you know we'll be able to trial an error
without actually making our own pieces

450
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
without actually making our own pieces
 

451
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,430
without actually making our own pieces
that's really neat you mentioned also

452
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
that's really neat you mentioned also
 

453
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,710
that's really neat you mentioned also
arduino and arduino is kind of

454
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
arduino and arduino is kind of
 

455
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,270
arduino and arduino is kind of
like it's a controller so yeah you know

456
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
like it's a controller so yeah you know
 

457
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,990
like it's a controller so yeah you know
whereas

458
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
whereas
 

459
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,830
whereas
a raspberry pi or other single board

460
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
a raspberry pi or other single board
 

461
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,029
a raspberry pi or other single board
computer is a true

462
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
computer is a true
 

463
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,790
computer is a true
real computer with an operating system

464
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
real computer with an operating system
 

465
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,029
real computer with an operating system
and everything an arduino is like you

466
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
and everything an arduino is like you
 

467
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,469
and everything an arduino is like you
just program it to do

468
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
just program it to do
 

469
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,430
just program it to do
a very specific task it's a solid state

470
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
a very specific task it's a solid state
 

471
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,909
a very specific task it's a solid state
and

472
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
and
 

473
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,790
and
it will respond to and i think this is

474
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
it will respond to and i think this is
 

475
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,869
it will respond to and i think this is
why it would work really well an arduino

476
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
why it would work really well an arduino
 

477
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,749
why it would work really well an arduino
for

478
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
for
 

479
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,110
for
uh for a useless box is because it's

480
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
uh for a useless box is because it's
 

481
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,589
uh for a useless box is because it's
like

482
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
like
 

483
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,189
like
it's either on or off that's right and

484
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
it's either on or off that's right and
 

485
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,029
it's either on or off that's right and
if it's on do this

486
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
if it's on do this
 

487
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,270
if it's on do this
and then it will turn off that's right

488
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
and then it will turn off that's right
 

489
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,110
and then it will turn off that's right
so very very basic programming

490
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
so very very basic programming
 

491
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,710
so very very basic programming
digital write four

492
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
digital write four
 

493
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,749
digital write four
comma hi hi semicolon and then we're

494
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
comma hi hi semicolon and then we're
 

495
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,510
comma hi hi semicolon and then we're
gonna delay for one second which is one

496
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
gonna delay for one second which is one
 

497
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,110
gonna delay for one second which is one
thousand milliseconds

498
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
thousand milliseconds
 

499
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,830
thousand milliseconds
uh and then we're gonna copy that line

500
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
uh and then we're gonna copy that line
 

501
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,150
uh and then we're gonna copy that line
uh

502
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
uh
 

503
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,029
uh
now what do you think high means versus

504
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
now what do you think high means versus
 

505
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,510
now what do you think high means versus
low

506
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
low
 

507
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,029
low
which is what i'm going to put here just

508
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
which is what i'm going to put here just
 

509
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,589
which is what i'm going to put here just
a guess on or off

510
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
a guess on or off
 

511
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,709
a guess on or off
yes so that's what my circuit now looks

512
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
yes so that's what my circuit now looks
 

513
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,269
yes so that's what my circuit now looks
like

514
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
like
 

515
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,469
like
and i'm going to simply plug this in to

516
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
and i'm going to simply plug this in to
 

517
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,230
and i'm going to simply plug this in to
usb power so i'm not plugging it into

518
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
usb power so i'm not plugging it into
 

519
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,909
usb power so i'm not plugging it into
the computer i want to actually power

520
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
the computer i want to actually power
 

521
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,190
the computer i want to actually power
this device

522
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
this device
 

523
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,910
this device
and see if it runs my program and if it

524
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
and see if it runs my program and if it
 

525
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,710
and see if it runs my program and if it
does

526
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
does
 

527
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,829
does
we should see this light flash

528
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
we should see this light flash
 

529
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,230
we should see this light flash
there we go that is neat every one

530
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
there we go that is neat every one
 

531
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,870
there we go that is neat every one
second so

532
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
second so
 

533
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,350
second so
we actually created the circuit fairly

534
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
we actually created the circuit fairly
 

535
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,230
we actually created the circuit fairly
quickly

536
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
quickly
 

537
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,790
quickly
uh and created the program to now tell

538
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
uh and created the program to now tell
 

539
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,829
uh and created the program to now tell
this light

540
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
this light
 

541
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,750
this light
what to do and we told it just very

542
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
what to do and we told it just very
 

543
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,110
what to do and we told it just very
simply

544
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
simply
 

545
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,590
simply
turn on and off again but if you're

546
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
turn on and off again but if you're
 

547
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,030
turn on and off again but if you're
making your own circuit you've got to

548
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
making your own circuit you've got to
 

549
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,509
making your own circuit you've got to
like do

550
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
like do
 

551
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,389
like do
ics you've got to program it yourself

552
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
ics you've got to program it yourself
 

553
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,070
ics you've got to program it yourself
yep you've got to figure out how

554
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
yep you've got to figure out how
 

555
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,389
yep you've got to figure out how
wow i i want to see this project as a

556
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
wow i i want to see this project as a
 

557
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,750
wow i i want to see this project as a
work in progress

558
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
work in progress
 

559
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,990
work in progress
okay and then see how uh how it comes

560
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
okay and then see how uh how it comes
 

561
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,590
okay and then see how uh how it comes
together yeah sounds good

562
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
together yeah sounds good
 

563
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,150
together yeah sounds good

works i'd love to help
and uh and that's something that i think

604
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
and uh and that's something that i think
 

605
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,470
and uh and that's something that i think
that i think that'll make a really neat

606
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
that i think that'll make a really neat
 

607
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,829
that i think that'll make a really neat
feature for the show as well as you

jeff definitely i'd really be interested
 

615
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,389
jeff definitely i'd really be interested
to know how things go

616
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
to know how things go
 

617
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,990
to know how things go
yeah i'll be posting things behind the

618
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
yeah i'll be posting things behind the
 

619
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,069
yeah i'll be posting things behind the
scenes a useless box any other

620
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
scenes a useless box any other
 

621
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,350
scenes a useless box any other
do you have any ideas yet

622
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
do you have any ideas yet
 

623
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,470
do you have any ideas yet
i get excited when i invent like when i

624
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
i get excited when i invent like when i
 

625
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,230
i get excited when i invent like when i
think of something have you had any of

626
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
think of something have you had any of
 

627
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
think of something have you had any of
those moments where

628
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
those moments where
 

629
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,670
those moments where
i'm like i really wish i had something

630
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
i'm like i really wish i had something
 

631
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,069
i'm like i really wish i had something
that would do this but it doesn't exist

632
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
that would do this but it doesn't exist
 

633
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,829
that would do this but it doesn't exist
this is where 3d printing is interesting

634
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
this is where 3d printing is interesting
 

635
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,910
this is where 3d printing is interesting
to me because i'm creating things that

636
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
to me because i'm creating things that
 

637
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,790
to me because i'm creating things that
don't exist yet i i haven't really

638
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
don't exist yet i i haven't really
 

639
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,430
don't exist yet i i haven't really
thought

640
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
thought
 

641
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,990
thought
that far as to what exists and doesn't

642
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
that far as to what exists and doesn't
 

643
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,430
that far as to what exists and doesn't
exist

644
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
exist
 

645
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,790
exist
um

646
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800

 

647
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,630

no i haven't really thought that far

648
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
no i haven't really thought that far
 

649
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,910
no i haven't really thought that far
come up with some ideas

650
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
come up with some ideas
 

651
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,829
come up with some ideas
yeah and share those there's a ton of

652
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
yeah and share those there's a ton of
 

653
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,910
yeah and share those there's a ton of
things for sure yeah like i've always

654
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
things for sure yeah like i've always
 

655
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,030
things for sure yeah like i've always
wanted to do

656
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
wanted to do
 

657
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,590
wanted to do
um a housewide sound system

658
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
um a housewide sound system
 

659
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,710
um a housewide sound system
that links up to um you know

660
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
that links up to um you know
 

661
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,710
that links up to um you know
our our amazon device and stuff like

662
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
our our amazon device and stuff like
 

663
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,230
our our amazon device and stuff like
that but i would like to have

664
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
that but i would like to have
 

665
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,190
that but i would like to have
sensors where when i walk from one room

666
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
sensors where when i walk from one room
 

667
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,389
sensors where when i walk from one room
to another

668
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
to another
 

669
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,910
to another
the motion sensor kicks in and it will

670
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
the motion sensor kicks in and it will
 

671
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,670
the motion sensor kicks in and it will
shut off the one room speakers

672
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
shut off the one room speakers
 

673
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,829
shut off the one room speakers
and add it to where i've just gone

674
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
and add it to where i've just gone
 

675
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,590
and add it to where i've just gone
that's way more advanced but that's

676
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
that's way more advanced but that's
 

677
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,949
that's way more advanced but that's
probably the only thing i can think of

678
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
probably the only thing i can think of
 

679
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,630
probably the only thing i can think of
where i'm like i want to do this but see

680
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
where i'm like i want to do this but see
 

681
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,990
where i'm like i want to do this but see
you talk about that and then i think

682
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
you talk about that and then i think
 

683
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,790
you talk about that and then i think
okay well

684
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
okay well
 

685
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,790
okay well
you could use a passive infrared sensor

686
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
you could use a passive infrared sensor
 

687
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,269
you could use a passive infrared sensor
yep which is used in motion sensors

688
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
yep which is used in motion sensors
 

689
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,470
yep which is used in motion sensors
you could use a laser sensor but

690
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
you could use a laser sensor but
 

691
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,670
you could use a laser sensor but
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's

692
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's
 

693
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,269
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's
just a little sensor that it's like okay

694
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
just a little sensor that it's like okay
 

695
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,069
just a little sensor that it's like okay
there was motion

696
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
there was motion
 

697
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,990
there was motion
do something yeah so you could create

698
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
do something yeah so you could create
 

699
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,470
do something yeah so you could create
something again with a relay

700
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
something again with a relay
 

701
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,949
something again with a relay
that controls just whether the speaker

702
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
that controls just whether the speaker
 

703
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,190
that controls just whether the speaker
has a completed circuit or not

704
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
has a completed circuit or not
 

705
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,829
has a completed circuit or not
yeah so if it was just a bunch of

706
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
yeah so if it was just a bunch of
 

707
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,990
yeah so if it was just a bunch of
speakers connected through an amplifier

708
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
speakers connected through an amplifier
 

709
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,870
speakers connected through an amplifier
you could have relays set up with pir

710
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
you could have relays set up with pir
 

711
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,710
you could have relays set up with pir
sensors that you'd be able to control by

712
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
sensors that you'd be able to control by
 

713
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,829
sensors that you'd be able to control by
motion

714
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
motion
 

715
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,470
motion
yeah good and if there's no motion for

716
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
yeah good and if there's no motion for
 

717
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,069
yeah good and if there's no motion for
10 minutes turn off the speaker

718
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
10 minutes turn off the speaker
 

719
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,190
10 minutes turn off the speaker
automatically or something like that

720
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
automatically or something like that
 

721
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,590
automatically or something like that
yeah

722
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
yeah
 

723
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,590
yeah
exactly so like these kinds of ideas

724
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
exactly so like these kinds of ideas
 

725
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,110
exactly so like these kinds of ideas
like there's so much stuff that you can

726
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
like there's so much stuff that you can
 

727
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,829
like there's so much stuff that you can
do

728
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
do
 

729
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,190
do
when you start to understand and then

730
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
when you start to understand and then
 

731
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,110
when you start to understand and then
there's the whole flip side of it where

732
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
there's the whole flip side of it where
 

733
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,670
there's the whole flip side of it where
something breaks and you can fix it yes

734
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
something breaks and you can fix it yes
 

735
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,269
something breaks and you can fix it yes
that's a good feeling

736
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
that's a good feeling
 

737
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,110
that's a good feeling
and that's done we've done that already

738
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
and that's done we've done that already
 

739
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,710
and that's done we've done that already
yeah nice so

740
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
yeah nice so
 

741
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,910
yeah nice so
you know you get those little battery

742
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
you know you get those little battery
 

743
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,870
you know you get those little battery
testers uh like to check the charge

744
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
testers uh like to check the charge
 

745
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,110
testers uh like to check the charge
yeah so we had one of those and it's

746
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
yeah so we had one of those and it's
 

747
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,310
yeah so we had one of those and it's
funny when my son was building his

748
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
funny when my son was building his
 

749
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,750
funny when my son was building his
calculator we weren't sure if the

750
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
calculator we weren't sure if the
 

751
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,110
calculator we weren't sure if the
batteries were working and we weren't

752
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
batteries were working and we weren't
 

753
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,389
batteries were working and we weren't
getting anything

754
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
getting anything
 

755
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,750
getting anything
i'm like this is odd that we're not

756
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
i'm like this is odd that we're not
 

757
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,590
i'm like this is odd that we're not
getting usually even if it's dead it

758
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
getting usually even if it's dead it
 

759
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,590
getting usually even if it's dead it
pops into the red but there was nothing

760
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
pops into the red but there was nothing
 

761
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,629
pops into the red but there was nothing
so we open it up turns out the actual

762
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
so we open it up turns out the actual
 

763
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,550
so we open it up turns out the actual
connection had broken apart

764
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
connection had broken apart
 

765
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,710
connection had broken apart
oh now i have no clue yeah and my son's

766
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
oh now i have no clue yeah and my son's
 

767
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,110
oh now i have no clue yeah and my son's
like oh i can fix that

768
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
like oh i can fix that
 

769
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,230
like oh i can fix that
and he fixed it and we put it back

770
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
and he fixed it and we put it back
 

771
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,509
and he fixed it and we put it back
together and then we and it works and

772
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
together and then we and it works and
 

773
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,670
together and then we and it works and
it's like oh yeah that's a dead battery

774
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
it's like oh yeah that's a dead battery
 

775
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,829
it's like oh yeah that's a dead battery
yeah i can relate to that too i use a

776
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
yeah i can relate to that too i use a
 

777
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,430
yeah i can relate to that too i use a
pillow speaker for podcasts

778
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
pillow speaker for podcasts
 

779
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,990
pillow speaker for podcasts
okay and uh because it's you know

780
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
okay and uh because it's you know
 

781
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,750
okay and uh because it's you know
connected by a wire to my phone

782
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
connected by a wire to my phone
 

783
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,750
connected by a wire to my phone
it gets pulled yep and it got pulled

784
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
it gets pulled yep and it got pulled
 

785
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,030
it gets pulled yep and it got pulled
right out so

786
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
right out so
 

787
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,870
right out so
it's such a simple thing but i totally

788
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
it's such a simple thing but i totally
 

789
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,030
it's such a simple thing but i totally
what did i do didn't buy another one no

790
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
what did i do didn't buy another one no
 

791
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,389
what did i do didn't buy another one no
no no i took it apart and i re-soldered

792
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
no no i took it apart and i re-soldered
 

793
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:00,790
no no i took it apart and i re-soldered
it

794
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
it
 

795
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,030
it
and reinforced it so it wouldn't happen

796
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
and reinforced it so it wouldn't happen
 

797
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,629
and reinforced it so it wouldn't happen
again oh beautiful made it better than

798
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
again oh beautiful made it better than
 

799
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,430
again oh beautiful made it better than
it was

800
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
it was
 

801
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,430
it was
he's he's turned his mind towards things

802
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
he's he's turned his mind towards things
 

803
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,710
he's he's turned his mind towards things
like uh e-waste

804
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
like uh e-waste
 

805
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,230
like uh e-waste
yes and he's like if somebody's gonna

806
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
yes and he's like if somebody's gonna
 

807
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,150
yes and he's like if somebody's gonna
get rid of their tv

808
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
get rid of their tv
 

809
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,509
get rid of their tv
or computer monitor chances are it's

810
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
or computer monitor chances are it's
 

811
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,110
or computer monitor chances are it's
still working dad it's just something

812
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120

871
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,870
twelve dollars we got a pack of three
we replaced one of those capacitors and

872
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
we replaced one of those capacitors and
 

873
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,310

can you fix stuff jeff
 

883
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,389
can you fix stuff jeff
let's say something comes into e-waste

884
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
let's say something comes into e-waste
 

885
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,750
let's say something comes into e-waste
or you you know you find something at

886
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
or you you know you find something at
 

887
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,870
or you you know you find something at
the side of the road that someone's just

888
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
the side of the road that someone's just
 

889
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,230
the side of the road that someone's just
discarded because they can't they don't

890
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
discarded because they can't they don't
 

891
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,430
discarded because they can't they don't
know how to fix it

892
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
know how to fix it
 

893
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,310
know how to fix it
um and maybe if fixing it is more

894
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
um and maybe if fixing it is more
 

895
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,069
um and maybe if fixing it is more
expensive than buying a new one in a lot

896
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
expensive than buying a new one in a lot
 

897
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,910
expensive than buying a new one in a lot
of cases too

898
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
of cases too
 

899
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,189
of cases too
um you can even if you can't fix it

900
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
um you can even if you can't fix it
 

901
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,949
um you can even if you can't fix it
you can do what's called desoldering

902
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
you can do what's called desoldering
 

903
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,949
you can do what's called desoldering
that's right so you can remove all the

904
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
that's right so you can remove all the
 

905
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,550
that's right so you can remove all the
good components from that

906
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
good components from that
 

907
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,189
good components from that
and put them in a drawer organizer yes

908
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
and put them in a drawer organizer yes
 

909
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,949
and put them in a drawer organizer yes
so that you can then have your own radio

910
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
so that you can then have your own radio
 

911
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,230
so that you can then have your own radio
shack at home where you've got the

912
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
shack at home where you've got the
 

913
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,710
shack at home where you've got the
drawers of all these different parts

914
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
drawers of all these different parts
 

915
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,710
drawers of all these different parts
