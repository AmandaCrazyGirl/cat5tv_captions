00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
they they taught me that okay well you
 

163
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,430
they they taught me that okay well you
need to have these

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
need to have these
 

165
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,990
need to have these
stl models and so that's how i learned

166
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
stl models and so that's how i learned
 

167
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,990
stl models and so that's how i learned
about things like thingiverse and

168
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
about things like thingiverse and
 

169
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,229
about things like thingiverse and
sites like sites like that where people

170
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
sites like sites like that where people
 

171
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,550
sites like sites like that where people
share their designs

172
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
share their designs
 

173
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,589
share their designs
um but because they closed down i

174
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
um but because they closed down i
 

175
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,430
um but because they closed down i
couldn't actually print anything

176
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
couldn't actually print anything
 

177
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,869
couldn't actually print anything
yeah but i didn't stop there i kept

178
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
yeah but i didn't stop there i kept
 

179
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,350
yeah but i didn't stop there i kept
trying to learn how to do 3d printing to

180
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
trying to learn how to do 3d printing to
 

181
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,949
trying to learn how to do 3d printing to
see because i wanted to see

182
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
see because i wanted to see
 

183
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,390
see because i wanted to see
is is it something that's going to be

184
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
is is it something that's going to be
 

185
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,350
is is it something that's going to be
practical so i started doing designs

186
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
practical so i started doing designs
 

187
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,390
practical so i started doing designs
on my computer before i even had

188
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
on my computer before i even had
 

189
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,670
on my computer before i even had
a printer even selected a printer so um

190
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
a printer even selected a printer so um
 

191
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,190
a printer even selected a printer so um
i think that was a really good way for

192
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
i think that was a really good way for
 

193
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,110
i think that was a really good way for
me to do it because it gave me a chance

194
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
me to do it because it gave me a chance

231
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,390
you know i've only printed three things
and the dalek is one of them

232

is the best printer by any stretch
 

365
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,070

right but as far as the economics of it
 

367
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,270
right but as far as the economics of it
go it's really

go it's really
 

369
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,430
go it's really
affordable and it does a great print job

370

and as far as
 

373
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,150
and as far as
out of the box experience goes you can

374
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
out of the box experience goes you can
 

375
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,909
out of the box experience goes you can
see i've already been printing stuff

00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
of the printers is you know you you read
 

385
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,309
of the printers is you know you you read
reviews you look at the

00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
uh what else have we got here we've got
 

519
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,269
uh what else have we got here we've got
more extrusions

520
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
more extrusions
 

521
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,149
more extrusions
for the frame these look like the z-axis

522
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
for the frame these look like the z-axis
 

523
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,070
for the frame these look like the z-axis
which is your up and down

524
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
which is your up and down
 

525
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,870
which is your up and down
part of the frame and just watch that

526
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
part of the frame and just watch that
 

527
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,469
part of the frame and just watch that
z-axis rod that's

528

fall out
 

533
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,910
fall out
so you can see that's a threaded rod

534
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
so you can see that's a threaded rod
 

535

it's got some grease on it so

536
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
it's got some grease on it so
 

537
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,470
it's got some grease on it so
watch that's why it's got that sleeve

538
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
watch that's why it's got that sleeve
 

539
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,070
watch that's why it's got that sleeve
but we're going to set everything aside

i could probably throw one of these

i mean i was shooting video and

746
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
i mean i was shooting video and
 

747
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,949
i mean i was shooting video and
everything so it's not really a fair

748
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
everything so it's not really a fair
 

749
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,430
everything so it's not really a fair
um equation right because you know i had

750
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
um equation right because you know i had
 

751
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,030
um equation right because you know i had
eight cameras around me and i'm setting

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,870

755
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,790

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
and things but i'm good for camera
 

757
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,030
and things but i'm good for camera
i got it uh about an hour and a half it

758
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
i got it uh about an hour and a half it
 

759
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,389
i got it uh about an hour and a half it
took me all together

760
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
took me all together
 

761
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,389
took me all together
so i think uh you could probably put

762
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
so i think uh you could probably put
 

763
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,230
so i think uh you could probably put
this together in about a half hour

first print yeah so this was just the g
 

823
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,269
first print yeah so this was just the g
code that was included on the sd card

824
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
code that was included on the sd card
 

825
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,069
code that was included on the sd card
and it came out

826
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
and it came out
 

827
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,470

then day two came and nothing was
 

835
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,710
then day two came and nothing was
working

836

working
the bed wasn't so because i'm starting

838
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
the bed wasn't so because i'm starting
 

839
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:51,910
the bed wasn't so because i'm starting

i'm starting to play around with my own
 

843
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,590
i'm starting to play around with my own
designs um you mentioned these hooks

844
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
designs um you mentioned these hooks
 

845
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,110
designs um you mentioned these hooks
we're gonna look at those

846
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
we're gonna look at those
 

847
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,350
we're gonna look at those
but so the hooks were gonna be my second

848
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
but so the hooks were gonna be my second
 

849
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,230
but so the hooks were gonna be my second
print

850

okay i designed my own mask hooks

852
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
okay i designed my own mask hooks
 

853
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,829
okay i designed my own mask hooks
yes and these are these are meant to go

854
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
yes and these are these are meant to go
 

855
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,309
yes and these are these are meant to go
on

856
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
on
 

857
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,990
on
a half inch pipe so the cold water

858
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
a half inch pipe so the cold water
 

859
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,909
a half inch pipe so the cold water
pipe in our laundry room because we have

860
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
pipe in our laundry room because we have
 

861
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,750
pipe in our laundry room because we have
an unfinished laundry room

862
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
an unfinished laundry room
 

863
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,150
an unfinished laundry room
this clips onto the half inch pipe and

864
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
this clips onto the half inch pipe and
 

865
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,189
this clips onto the half inch pipe and
it gives

866
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
it gives
 

867
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,110
it gives
us a place to dry our reusable washable

868
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
us a place to dry our reusable washable
 

869
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,750
us a place to dry our reusable washable
masks

870
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
masks
 

871
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,390
masks
our face masks so it's just a neat

872
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
our face masks so it's just a neat
 

873
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,870
our face masks so it's just a neat
little

874
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
little
 

875
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,029
little
thing that i came up with but my wife

876
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
thing that i came up with but my wife
 

877
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,870
thing that i came up with but my wife
was was thinking like hey this is really

878
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
was was thinking like hey this is really
 

879
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,190
was was thinking like hey this is really
really high i can't quite reach it

880
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
really high i can't quite reach it
 

881
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,190
really high i can't quite reach it
so the next iteration was a little bit

882
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
so the next iteration was a little bit
 

883
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,549
so the next iteration was a little bit
longer and a little bit longer and i

884
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
longer and a little bit longer and i
 

885
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,909
longer and a little bit longer and i
went through a couple of iterations so

886
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
went through a couple of iterations so
 

887
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,789
went through a couple of iterations so
this was the

888
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
this was the
 

889
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,549
this was the
the first one was just this little tiny

890
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
the first one was just this little tiny
 

891
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,830
the first one was just this little tiny
guy yep right

892
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
guy yep right
 

893
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,669
guy yep right
and then the next one was a little bit

894
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
and then the next one was a little bit
 

895
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,230
and then the next one was a little bit
longer and then finally

896
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
longer and then finally
 

897
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,430
longer and then finally
the final print came out like this so

898
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
the final print came out like this so
 

899
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,230
the final print came out like this so
i simply i simply extended the uh the

900
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
i simply i simply extended the uh the
 

901
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,950
i simply i simply extended the uh the
length of it

902
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960
length of it
 

903
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,870
length of it
and i designed this in a program called

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
and i designed this in a program called

916
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
printing
 

917
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,630
printing
uh but that's what i use to design this

918
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
uh but that's what i use to design this
 

919
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,470
uh but that's what i use to design this
so i basically just i laid it out in

920
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
so i basically just i laid it out in
 

921
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,430
so i basically just i laid it out in
tinkercad and

922
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
tinkercad and
 

923
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,230
tinkercad and
and that's what i came up with so and it

924
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
and that's what i came up with so and it
 

925
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,870
and that's what i came up with so and it
printed

926
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
printed
 

927
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,350
printed
great once i figured it out but day two

928
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
great once i figured it out but day two
 

929
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,310
great once i figured it out but day two
came

930
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
came
 

931
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,750
came
and nothing was working and i say that

932
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
and nothing was working and i say that
 

933
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,669
and nothing was working and i say that
because i was struggling to get the bed

934
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
because i was struggling to get the bed
 

935
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,990
because i was struggling to get the bed
to level because nothing was sticking to

936
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
to level because nothing was sticking to
 

937
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,029
to level because nothing was sticking to
the bed

938
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
the bed
 

939
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,710
the bed
and it's really really important what i

940
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
and it's really really important what i
 

941
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,110
and it's really really important what i
found is it's very important that the

942
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
found is it's very important that the
 

943
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,950
found is it's very important that the
first couple of layers are stuck to the

944
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
first couple of layers are stuck to the
 

945
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,830
first couple of layers are stuck to the
bed

946
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
bed

because if they're not as the printer is

948
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
because if they're not as the printer is
 

949
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,870
because if they're not as the printer is
moving

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,190
moving
up it's gonna it's gonna lose adhesion

and it's gonna move
 

955
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,390
and it's gonna move
the the print is going to move and then

956
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
the the print is going to move and then
 

957
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,510
the the print is going to move and then
it's not going to be printing the right

958
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
it's not going to be printing the right
 

959
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,870
it's not going to be printing the right
thing in the right spot and it's not

960
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
thing in the right spot and it's not
 

961
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,590
thing in the right spot and it's not
going to work out

962
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
going to work out
 

963
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,510
going to work out
was the bed heating up the bed was

964
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520

heating up to 60 degrees celsius
everything was working there so i did

968
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
everything was working there so i did
 

969
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,029
everything was working there so i did
everything from

i gave it a quick wipe down with some

972
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
i gave it a quick wipe down with some
 

973
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,430
i gave it a quick wipe down with some
isopropyl alcohol

974
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
isopropyl alcohol
 

975
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,230
isopropyl alcohol
um i upgraded the firmware to one from

976
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
um i upgraded the firmware to one from
 

977
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,990
um i upgraded the firmware to one from
filament friday because it came with an

978
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
filament friday because it came with an
 

979
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,909
filament friday because it came with an
like the original firmware had some bugs

980
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
like the original firmware had some bugs
 

981
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,350
like the original firmware had some bugs
in it that he'd mentioned

982
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
in it that he'd mentioned
 

983
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,909
in it that he'd mentioned
and so i installed his firmware and it

984
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
and so i installed his firmware and it
 

985
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,710
and so i installed his firmware and it
still wasn't working for me yeah

986
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
still wasn't working for me yeah
 

987
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,190
still wasn't working for me yeah
and then i started thinking because you

988
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
and then i started thinking because you
 

989
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,990
and then i started thinking because you
know i'm i'm

990
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
know i'm i'm
 

991
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,830
know i'm i'm
the troubleshooter right yes so i've

992
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
the troubleshooter right yes so i've
 

993
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,750
the troubleshooter right yes so i've
tried everything every time i leveled

994
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
tried everything every time i leveled
 

995
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,549
tried everything every time i leveled
the bed

996
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
the bed
 

997
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,270
the bed
it still wasn't adhering to the bed so

998
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
it still wasn't adhering to the bed so
 

999
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,870
it still wasn't adhering to the bed so
then i started saying okay well what's

1000
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
then i started saying okay well what's
 

1001
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,549
then i started saying okay well what's
different between yesterday and today

1002
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
different between yesterday and today
 

1003
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,430
different between yesterday and today
and the one thing that i came up with is

1004
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
and the one thing that i came up with is
 

1005
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,270
and the one thing that i came up with is
our first day print

1006
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
our first day print
 

1007
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,470
our first day print
was from the g-code provided by creality

1008
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
was from the g-code provided by creality
 

1009
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,590
was from the g-code provided by creality
yeah creality my second print

1010
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
yeah creality my second print
 

1011
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,150
yeah creality my second print
second day print was a g-code that i

1012
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
second day print was a g-code that i
 

1013
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,110
second day print was a g-code that i
created

1014
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
created
 

1015
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,630
created
now understand so i've learned a couple

1016
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
now understand so i've learned a couple
 

1017
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,310
now understand so i've learned a couple
of things so i mentioned that i made

1018
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
of things so i mentioned that i made
 

1019
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,830
of things so i mentioned that i made
this in tinkercad i designed it in

1020
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
this in tinkercad i designed it in
 

1021
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,789
this in tinkercad i designed it in
tinkercad

1022
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
tinkercad
 

1023
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,669
tinkercad
but that gives you an stl file yes or an

1024
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
but that gives you an stl file yes or an
 

1025
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,430
but that gives you an stl file yes or an
obj or whatever so these are the file

1026
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
obj or whatever so these are the file
 

1027
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,470
obj or whatever so these are the file
extensions

1028
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
extensions
 

1029
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,870
extensions
so that stl file can't go to the printer

1030
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
so that stl file can't go to the printer
 

1031
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,110
so that stl file can't go to the printer
you need what's called a g-code which is

1032
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
you need what's called a g-code which is
 

1033
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,350
you need what's called a g-code which is
a file that tells it how to build the

1034
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
a file that tells it how to build the
 

1035
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,350
a file that tells it how to build the
layers okay so that's

1036
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360
layers okay so that's
 

1037
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,669
layers okay so that's
i'm using a program called cura which is

1038
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
i'm using a program called cura which is
 

1039
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,029
i'm using a program called cura which is
also free

1040
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039

printing

1044
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
printing
 

1045
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,190
printing
and with that software um it

1046
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
and with that software um it
 

1047
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,990
and with that software um it
creates the slice layers yes and it

1048
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
creates the slice layers yes and it
 

1049
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,950
creates the slice layers yes and it
spews out a file called a g-code file

1050
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
spews out a file called a g-code file
 

1051
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,470
spews out a file called a g-code file
and so the g-code for this was on the sd

1052
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
and so the g-code for this was on the sd
 

1053
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,590
and so the g-code for this was on the sd
card came with it the g

1054
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
card came with it the g
 

1055
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,909
card came with it the g
code for this is something that i made

1056
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
code for this is something that i made
 

1057
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,870
code for this is something that i made
in kira

1058
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
in kira
 

1059
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,470
in kira
okay so then i started thinking okay

1060
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
okay so then i started thinking okay
 

1061
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,630
okay so then i started thinking okay
well what's different so

1062
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
well what's different so
 

1063
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,190
well what's different so
i got researching i got looking into it

1064
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
i got researching i got looking into it
 

1065
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,830
i got researching i got looking into it
and then

1066
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
and then
 

1067
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,070
and then
finally after several hours of tinkering

1068
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
finally after several hours of tinkering
 

1069
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,110
finally after several hours of tinkering
jeff i

1070

jeff i
 

1071
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,990
jeff i
found out that g-code is actually a text

1072
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
found out that g-code is actually a text
 

1073
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,710
found out that g-code is actually a text
file

1074
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
file
 

1075
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,310
file
a script oh so i opened it

1076
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
a script oh so i opened it
 

1077
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,590
a script oh so i opened it
in my text editor yep and looked at it

1078
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
in my text editor yep and looked at it
 

1079
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,630
in my text editor yep and looked at it
and i started seeing that this is just a

1080
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
and i started seeing that this is just a
 

1081
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,990
and i started seeing that this is just a
script it's like code

1082
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
script it's like code
 

1083
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,470
script it's like code
yeah so then i looked at the code for

1084
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
yeah so then i looked at the code for
 

1085
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,510
yeah so then i looked at the code for
this one

1086
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
this one
 

1087
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,510
this one
and i looked at the code for mine and i

1088
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
and i looked at the code for mine and i
 

1089
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,789
and i looked at the code for mine and i
compared the difference

1090
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
compared the difference
 

1091
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,190
compared the difference
at the start of the file and found that

1092
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
at the start of the file and found that
 

1093
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,190
at the start of the file and found that
my g-code from cura

1094
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
my g-code from cura
 

1095
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,470
my g-code from cura
was telling the extruder to raise

1096
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
was telling the extruder to raise
 

1097
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,390
was telling the extruder to raise
two millimeters at the start of the

1098
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
two millimeters at the start of the
 

1099
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,230
two millimeters at the start of the
print and there was a comment that said

1100
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
print and there was a comment that said
 

1101
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,270
print and there was a comment that said
oh so that it doesn't scratch the print

1102
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
oh so that it doesn't scratch the print
 

1103
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,149
oh so that it doesn't scratch the print
bed

1104
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
bed
 

1105
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,909
bed
and it was raising a full two

1106
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
and it was raising a full two
 

1107
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,669
and it was raising a full two
millimeters so i started looking

1108
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
millimeters so i started looking
 

1109
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,190
millimeters so i started looking
so i started another print and i looked

1110
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
so i started another print and i looked
 

1111
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,190
so i started another print and i looked
down at the extruder and sure enough

1112
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
down at the extruder and sure enough
 

1113
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,870
down at the extruder and sure enough
at the beginning at the beginning of the

1114
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
at the beginning at the beginning of the
 

1115
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,950
at the beginning at the beginning of the
print i saw the extruder go up two

1116
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
print i saw the extruder go up two
 

1117
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,870
print i saw the extruder go up two
millimeters so it wasn't

1118
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
millimeters so it wasn't
 

1119
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,510
millimeters so it wasn't
quite down on the bed so it wasn't able

1120
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
quite down on the bed so it wasn't able
 

1121
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,590
quite down on the bed so it wasn't able
to adhere to the bed so i went in

1122
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
to adhere to the bed so i went in
 

1123
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,149
to adhere to the bed so i went in
i copied the header from this g-code and

1124
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
i copied the header from this g-code and
 

1125
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,070
i copied the header from this g-code and
pasted it over top the header

1126
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
pasted it over top the header
 

1127
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,110
pasted it over top the header
of my g-code and i printed out a good

1128
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
of my g-code and i printed out a good
 

1129
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,070
of my g-code and i printed out a good
10 15 of these hooks and it worked

1130
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
10 15 of these hooks and it worked
 

1131
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,110
10 15 of these hooks and it worked
perfectly

1132
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
perfectly
 

1133
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,430
perfectly
why the different header because you

1134
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
why the different header because you
 

1135
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,590
why the different header because you
didn't program that different start code

1136
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
didn't program that different start code
 

1137
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,630
didn't program that different start code
no it was just the default profile so it

1138
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
no it was just the default profile so it
 

1139
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,590
no it was just the default profile so it
would it had this

1140
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
would it had this
 

1141
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,750
would it had this
raise up two millimeters or whatever so

1142
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
raise up two millimeters or whatever so
 

1143
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,230
raise up two millimeters or whatever so
so having replaced it with this

1144
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
so having replaced it with this
 

1145
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,870
so having replaced it with this
header the start code from this one

1146
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
header the start code from this one
 

1147
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,630
header the start code from this one
everything printed just fine

1148
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
everything printed just fine
 

1149
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,870
everything printed just fine
so i was like oh so that was a

1150
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
so i was like oh so that was a
 

1151
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,710
so i was like oh so that was a
revelation for me to realize that

1152
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
revelation for me to realize that
 

1153
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,750
revelation for me to realize that
the g code is an editable script that

1154
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
the g code is an editable script that
 

1155
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,510
the g code is an editable script that
you can go in and you can modify and

1156
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
you can go in and you can modify and
 

1157
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,630
you can go in and you can modify and
then i'm thinking about all the

1158
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
then i'm thinking about all the
 

1159
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,070
then i'm thinking about all the
wonderful things that you can do with

1160
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
wonderful things that you can do with
 

1161
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,950
wonderful things that you can do with
that knowledge

1162
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
that knowledge
 

1163
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,110
that knowledge
yeah and it's wonderful so then i took

1164
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
yeah and it's wonderful so then i took
 

1165
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,230
yeah and it's wonderful so then i took
that g code the

1166
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
that g code the
 

1167
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,710
that g code the
the start part of the g code and i

1168
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
the start part of the g code and i
 

1169
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,870
the start part of the g code and i
pasted it into my profile in

1170
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
pasted it into my profile in
 

1171
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,710
pasted it into my profile in
cura to always use that as my start code

1172
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
cura to always use that as my start code
 

1173
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,270
cura to always use that as my start code
that's

1174
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
that's
 

1175
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,510
that's
replacing the one that came with it made

1176
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,520
replacing the one that came with it made
 

1177
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,350
replacing the one that came with it made
a couple of little mini modifications

1178
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
a couple of little mini modifications
 

1179
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,630
a couple of little mini modifications
based on the knowledge that i had

1180
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
based on the knowledge that i had
 

1181
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,070
based on the knowledge that i had
accumulated from

1182
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
accumulated from
 

1183
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,630
accumulated from
the research that i had done yep and uh

1184
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
the research that i had done yep and uh
 

1185
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,870
the research that i had done yep and uh
now i've got a start code that is

1186
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
now i've got a start code that is
 

1187
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,909
now i've got a start code that is
working like that just beautiful so

1188
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
working like that just beautiful so
 

1189
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,990
working like that just beautiful so
every prank comes out people would have

1190
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
every prank comes out people would have
 

1191
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,310
every prank comes out people would have
run into that issue and would have said

1192
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
run into that issue and would have said
 

1193
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,430
run into that issue and would have said
the machine's just not working

1194
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
the machine's just not working
 

1195
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,390
the machine's just not working
nobody was saying check the start code

1196
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
nobody was saying check the start code
 

1197
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,669
nobody was saying check the start code
on your g-code

1198
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:45,679
on your g-code
 

1199
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,270
on your g-code
everybody was saying okay make sure your

1200
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
everybody was saying okay make sure your
 

1201
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,870
everybody was saying okay make sure your
bed is level yeah i did that

1202
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
bed is level yeah i did that
 

1203
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,270
bed is level yeah i did that
10 times make sure that the bed is clean

1204
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
10 times make sure that the bed is clean
 

1205
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,310
10 times make sure that the bed is clean
yeah i did that

1206
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
yeah i did that
 

1207
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,909
yeah i did that
make sure you know that there's no

1208
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
make sure you know that there's no
 

1209
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,830
make sure you know that there's no
interesting yeah so all this stuff make

1210
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
interesting yeah so all this stuff make
 

1211
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,350
interesting yeah so all this stuff make
sure the bed temperature is good

1212
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
sure the bed temperature is good
 

1213
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,990
sure the bed temperature is good
uh the g code from cura was defaulting

1214
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
uh the g code from cura was defaulting
 

1215
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,669
uh the g code from cura was defaulting
to 50 degrees celsius

1216
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
to 50 degrees celsius
 

1217
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,350
to 50 degrees celsius
i noticed that this one was 60 degrees

1218
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
i noticed that this one was 60 degrees
 

1219
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,350
i noticed that this one was 60 degrees
celsius so i increased it

1220
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
celsius so i increased it
 

1221
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,350
celsius so i increased it
yeah and that was done through the

1222
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
yeah and that was done through the
 

1223
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,549
yeah and that was done through the
material

1224
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
material
 

1225
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,549
material
in cura again i'm going to show you how

1226
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
in cura again i'm going to show you how
 

1227
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,470
in cura again i'm going to show you how
to do all these things so don't worry

1228
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
to do all these things so don't worry
 

1229
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,870
to do all these things so don't worry
okay but that's what i learned so then

1230
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
okay but that's what i learned so then
 

1231
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,789
okay but that's what i learned so then
we started printing other things and

1232
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
we started printing other things and
 

1233
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,270
we started printing other things and
my other son zach said i really want a

1234
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
my other son zach said i really want a
 

1235
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,909
my other son zach said i really want a
dalek

1236
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
dalek
 

1237
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,350
dalek
yes and so we got onto thingiverse and

1238
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
yes and so we got onto thingiverse and
 

1239
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,630
yes and so we got onto thingiverse and
downloaded the stl file for a dalek

1240
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
downloaded the stl file for a dalek
 

1241
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,149
downloaded the stl file for a dalek
now that is not monochromatic that's

1242
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
now that is not monochromatic that's
 

1243
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,990
now that is not monochromatic that's
got two colors you're right so what we

1244
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
got two colors you're right so what we
 

1245
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,390
got two colors you're right so what we
actually did is we first printed

1246
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
actually did is we first printed
 

1247
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,510
actually did is we first printed
these parts okay okay so these little

1248
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
these parts okay okay so these little
 

1249
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,230
these parts okay okay so these little
guys

1250
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,240
guys
 

1251
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,630
guys
the extensions and these actually clip

1252
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
the extensions and these actually clip
 

1253
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,269
the extensions and these actually clip
into

1254
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
into
 

1255
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,630
into
the daleks so we printed it in two parts

1256
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
the daleks so we printed it in two parts
 

1257
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,830
the daleks so we printed it in two parts
very cool yeah you'll see that these are

1258
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
very cool yeah you'll see that these are
 

1259
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,789
very cool yeah you'll see that these are
all white

1260
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
all white
 

1261
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,669
all white
yes they are all printed jeff with that

1262
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
yes they are all printed jeff with that
 

1263
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,950
yes they are all printed jeff with that
sample spool

1264
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
sample spool
 

1265
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,269
sample spool
of filament i was able to sample i was

1266
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
of filament i was able to sample i was
 

1267
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,710
of filament i was able to sample i was
able to get this out of the sam

1268
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
able to get this out of the sam
 

1269
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,470
able to get this out of the sam
sample that they wow so i didn't even

1270
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
sample that they wow so i didn't even
 

1271
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,990
sample that they wow so i didn't even
have to tap into

1272
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
have to tap into
 

1273
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,190
have to tap into
my purchased filament so that is what we

1274
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
my purchased filament so that is what we
 

1275
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,149
my purchased filament so that is what we
came up with for

1276
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159
came up with for
 

1277
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,789
came up with for
for zach as well so i was really really

1278
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
for zach as well so i was really really
 

1279
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,149
for zach as well so i was really really
impressed with that and he's very very

1280
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
impressed with that and he's very very
 

1281
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,350
impressed with that and he's very very
happy with that model

1282
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
happy with that model
 

1283
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,669
happy with that model
uh when i was removing the um the

1284
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
uh when i was removing the um the
 

1285
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,990
uh when i was removing the um the
supports for the uh the black parts

1286
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
supports for the uh the black parts
 

1287
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,950
supports for the uh the black parts
because they're so

1288
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
because they're so
 

1289
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,350
because they're so

i was able to say you can reprint and we
start talking about how because there

1298
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,000
start talking about how because there
 

1299
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,230
start talking about how because there
are

1300
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
are
 

1301
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,830
are
attachments we could create other

1302
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
attachments we could create other
 

1303
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,669
attachments we could create other
attachments and yes play around with all

1304
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
attachments and yes play around with all
 

1305
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:27,990
attachments and yes play around with all
that

1306
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
that
 

1307
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,430
that
kind of stuff so speaking of wanting to

1308
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
kind of stuff so speaking of wanting to
 

1309
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,549
kind of stuff so speaking of wanting to
um basically adapt

1310
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
um basically adapt
 

1311
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,269
um basically adapt
our designs to our own needs so creating

1312
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
our designs to our own needs so creating
 

1313
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,029
our designs to our own needs so creating
attachments and things like that

1314
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
attachments and things like that
 

1315
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,190
attachments and things like that
the next thing that we wanted to do is

1316
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
the next thing that we wanted to do is
 

1317
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,950
the next thing that we wanted to do is
well he wanted to print in black

1318
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
well he wanted to print in black
 

1319
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,990
well he wanted to print in black
of course so i got a little spool 250

1320
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
of course so i got a little spool 250
 

1321
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,029
of course so i got a little spool 250
grams of black filament and

1322
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
grams of black filament and
 

1323
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,029
grams of black filament and
it's fine but it was affordable because

1324
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
it's fine but it was affordable because
 

1325
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,350
it's fine but it was affordable because
it's only 250 grams i didn't need a big

1326
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
it's only 250 grams i didn't need a big
 

1327
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,830
it's only 250 grams i didn't need a big
one kilogram thing but it doesn't fit on

1328
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
one kilogram thing but it doesn't fit on
 

1329
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,830
one kilogram thing but it doesn't fit on
the spool holder because the hole is too

1330
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
the spool holder because the hole is too
 

1331
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,710
the spool holder because the hole is too
small

1332
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
small
 

1333
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,430

holder
 

1341
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,669
holder
so i actually i went on and and i

1342
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
so i actually i went on and and i
 

1343
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,269
so i actually i went on and and i
started designing

1344
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
started designing
 

1345
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,870
started designing
based on some designs that i found on

1346
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
based on some designs that i found on
 

1347
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,870
based on some designs that i found on
thingiverse but i created this little

1348
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
thingiverse but i created this little
 

1349
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,510
thingiverse but i created this little
guy

1350
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
guy
 

1351
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,710
guy
so this is printed with the transparent

1352
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
so this is printed with the transparent
 

1353
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,070
so this is printed with the transparent
uh filament this is a new spool holder

1354
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
uh filament this is a new spool holder
 

1355
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,750
uh filament this is a new spool holder
specifically designed

1356
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
specifically designed
 

1357
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,230
specifically designed
to hold these little spools well so i

1358
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
to hold these little spools well so i
 

1359
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,950
to hold these little spools well so i
built i

1360
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
built i
 

1361
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,510
built i
made this spool holder specifically to

1362
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
made this spool holder specifically to
 

1363
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,310
made this spool holder specifically to
replace

1364
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
replace
 

1365
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,390
replace
that and it just screws on yep and

1366
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
that and it just screws on yep and
 

1367
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,350
that and it just screws on yep and
allows me to

1368
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
allows me to
 

1369
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,909
allows me to
to print using the 250 gram spools so

1370
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:35,919
to print using the 250 gram spools so
 

1371
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,190
to print using the 250 gram spools so
then i'm like

1372
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
then i'm like
 

1373

then i'm like
i can actually adapt my 3d printer

1374
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
i can actually adapt my 3d printer
 

1375
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,789
i can actually adapt my 3d printer

1401
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,630
for them i think as well
but the ender 3v2 has been i mean so far

1402
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
but the ender 3v2 has been i mean so far
 

1403
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,110
but the ender 3v2 has been i mean so far
so good it's a fantastic little printer

1404
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
so good it's a fantastic little printer
 

1405
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,070
so good it's a fantastic little printer
it's quiet it's got the quiet circuit

1406
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
it's quiet it's got the quiet circuit
 

1407
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,390
it's quiet it's got the quiet circuit
the

1408
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
the
 

1409
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,830
the
the the board itself is like

1410
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
the the board itself is like
 

1411
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,269
the the board itself is like
i don't know it's upgraded on the uh v2

1412
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
i don't know it's upgraded on the uh v2
 

1413
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,029
i don't know it's upgraded on the uh v2
and apparently is quieter than the older

1414
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
and apparently is quieter than the older
 

1415
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,070
and apparently is quieter than the older
versions we're going to be looking at

1416
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
versions we're going to be looking at
 

1417
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,870
versions we're going to be looking at
the actual

1418
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
the actual
 

1419
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,950
the actual
sound that it generates but you hear the

1420
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
sound that it generates but you hear the
 

1421
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,230
sound that it generates but you hear the
fans

1422
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
fans
 

1423
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,750
fans
there is the cooling system to keep

1424
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
there is the cooling system to keep
 

1425
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,750
there is the cooling system to keep
things cool yep um but

1426
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
things cool yep um but
 

1427
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,909
things cool yep um but
uh it's reasonably quiet like we could

1428
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
uh it's reasonably quiet like we could
 

1429
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,350
uh it's reasonably quiet like we could
have it running right here and it

1430
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
have it running right here and it
 

1431
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,070
have it running right here and it
wouldn't uh

1432
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
wouldn't uh
 

1433
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,590
wouldn't uh
it wouldn't probably even be picked up

1434
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
it wouldn't probably even be picked up
 

1435
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,990
it wouldn't probably even be picked up
on our microphones

1436
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
on our microphones
 

1437
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,909
on our microphones
yeah so that's kind of you know that's a

1438
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
yeah so that's kind of you know that's a
 

1439
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,909
yeah so that's kind of you know that's a
bit of a primer as to you know here i am

bit of a primer as to you know here i am
 

1441
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,070
bit of a primer as to you know here i am
i'm brand new to 3d printing and i'm 3d
