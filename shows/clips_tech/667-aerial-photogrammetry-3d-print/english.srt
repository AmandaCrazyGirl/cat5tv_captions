1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,430

today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
today we're going to talk about
 

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,670
today we're going to talk about
a really new exciting segment on

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
a really new exciting segment on
 

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,870
a really new exciting segment on
photogrametry

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
photogrametry
 

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,310
photogrametry
what is photogrammetry latch asked

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
what is photogrammetry latch asked
 

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,549
what is photogrammetry latch asked
basically we can take our drones now and

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
basically we can take our drones now and
 

11
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,509
basically we can take our drones now and
we can produce

12
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
we can produce
 

13
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,390
we can produce
3d images so we can make 3d models of

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
3d images so we can make 3d models of
 

15
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,990
3d images so we can make 3d models of
real world objects

16
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
real world objects
 

17
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,950
real world objects
so whether that's a building a field

18
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
so whether that's a building a field
 

19
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,830
so whether that's a building a field
your house

20
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
your house
 

21
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,390
your house
your business whatever you can take your

22
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
your business whatever you can take your
 

23
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,109
your business whatever you can take your
drone

24
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
drone
 

25
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,429
drone
take photos of your property and make

26
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
take photos of your property and make
 

27
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,710
take photos of your property and make
that into a 3d

28
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
that into a 3d
 

29
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,910
that into a 3d
image or in this case 3d model with that

30
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
image or in this case 3d model with that
 

31
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,430
image or in this case 3d model with that
being said we're going to take it one

32
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
being said we're going to take it one
 

33
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,470
being said we're going to take it one
step further

34
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
step further
 

35
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,229
step further
and we're going to take that 3d model

36
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
and we're going to take that 3d model
 

37
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,670
and we're going to take that 3d model
and 3d print it

38
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
and 3d print it
 

39
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,830
and 3d print it
so then you have your house in the palm

40
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
so then you have your house in the palm
 

41
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,030
so then you have your house in the palm
of your hand

42
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
of your hand
 

43
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,750
of your hand
what use is this i'm glad you asked an

44
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
what use is this i'm glad you asked an
 

45
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,670
what use is this i'm glad you asked an
example of what this can be used for

46
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
example of what this can be used for
 

47
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,510
example of what this can be used for
is if you're a real estate agent and

48
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
is if you're a real estate agent and
 

49
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,869
is if you're a real estate agent and
you're trying to sell a house but

50
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
you're trying to sell a house but
 

51
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,630
you're trying to sell a house but
somebody has a hard time seeing they

52
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
somebody has a hard time seeing they
 

53
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,229
somebody has a hard time seeing they
could be blind

54
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
could be blind
 

55
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,869
could be blind
etc what you can do is that you can 3d

56
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
etc what you can do is that you can 3d
 

57
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,549
etc what you can do is that you can 3d
scan the property

58
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
scan the property
 

59
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,790
scan the property
3d print that property and then they can

60
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
3d print that property and then they can
 

61
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,470
3d print that property and then they can
actually feel the house with their very

62
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
actually feel the house with their very
 

63
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,189
actually feel the house with their very
own hands

64
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
own hands
 

65
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,990
own hands
how cool is that now stay tuned for this

66
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
how cool is that now stay tuned for this
 

67
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,149
how cool is that now stay tuned for this
exciting segment as we go over how to

68
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
exciting segment as we go over how to
 

69
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,270
exciting segment as we go over how to
3d print as well as 3d capture using

70
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
3d print as well as 3d capture using
 

71
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,630
3d print as well as 3d capture using
photogrammetry

72
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
photogrammetry
 

73
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:29,070
photogrammetry
let's take a look

74
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,080

 

75
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,790

[Applause]

76
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:30,800
[Applause]
 

77
00:01:30,800 --> 00:02:04,230
[Applause]
[Music]

78
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
[Music]
 

79
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,990
[Music]
so now that our drone's safely back on

80
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
so now that our drone's safely back on
 

81
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,749
so now that our drone's safely back on
the ground what we can do is head back

82
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
the ground what we can do is head back
 

83
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,949
the ground what we can do is head back
to the studio

84
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
to the studio
 

85
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,270
to the studio
upload these images to the cloud to the

86
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
upload these images to the cloud to the
 

87
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,229
upload these images to the cloud to the
software

88
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
software
 

89
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,830
software
that will then stitch it all together

90
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
that will then stitch it all together
 

91
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,510
that will then stitch it all together
into our 3d model

92
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
into our 3d model
 

93
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,589
into our 3d model
so that's pretty cool let's go take a

94
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
so that's pretty cool let's go take a
 

95
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,790
so that's pretty cool let's go take a
look at that

96
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
look at that
 

97
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,150
look at that
let's go all right now we're back in the

98
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
let's go all right now we're back in the
 

99
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,030
let's go all right now we're back in the
studio here

100
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
studio here
 

101
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,550
studio here
um i know this is a different building

102
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
um i know this is a different building
 

103
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,309
um i know this is a different building
than we used before but this one's a

104
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
than we used before but this one's a
 

105
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,990
than we used before but this one's a
really nice example so we're going to

106
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
really nice example so we're going to
 

107
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,030
really nice example so we're going to
use this uh

108
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
use this uh
 

109
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,710
use this uh
provided example here so let's pretend

110
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
provided example here so let's pretend
 

111
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,869
provided example here so let's pretend
we we've finished flying we did our

112
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
we we've finished flying we did our
 

113
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,589
we we've finished flying we did our
little grid pattern or whatever we flew

114
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
little grid pattern or whatever we flew
 

115
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,710
little grid pattern or whatever we flew
now we upload our photos to

116
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
now we upload our photos to
 

117
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,550
now we upload our photos to
your provider in this case it's drone

118
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
your provider in this case it's drone
 

119
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,550
your provider in this case it's drone
deploy but it could be pix4d

120
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
deploy but it could be pix4d
 

121
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,830
deploy but it could be pix4d
or dji um and then after

122
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
or dji um and then after
 

123
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,309
or dji um and then after
it processes you get something cool

124
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
it processes you get something cool
 

125
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,509
it processes you get something cool
looking like this

126
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
looking like this
 

127
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,949
looking like this
so again we have our ortho mosaic

128
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
so again we have our ortho mosaic
 

129
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,030
so again we have our ortho mosaic
so it's like a giant 2d map so kind of

130
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
so it's like a giant 2d map so kind of
 

131
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,589
so it's like a giant 2d map so kind of
imagine this as a more high definition

132
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
imagine this as a more high definition
 

133
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,630
imagine this as a more high definition
google maps or

134
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
google maps or
 

135
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,149
google maps or
satellite image right so this image here

136
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
satellite image right so this image here
 

137
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,430
satellite image right so this image here
now you can see on this overlaid map

138
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
now you can see on this overlaid map
 

139
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,270
now you can see on this overlaid map
this is made of hundreds of images

140
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
this is made of hundreds of images
 

141
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,710
this is made of hundreds of images
stitched together

142
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
stitched together
 

143
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,630
stitched together
to make make it look like it's a

144
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
to make make it look like it's a
 

145
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,750
to make make it look like it's a
satellite image

146
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
satellite image
 

147
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,350
satellite image
which is really really cool it's a it's

148
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
which is really really cool it's a it's
 

149
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,430
which is really really cool it's a it's
a really cool program

150
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
a really cool program
 

151
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,190
a really cool program
but of course with this since there's

152
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
but of course with this since there's
 

153
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,350
but of course with this since there's
gps data within

154
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
gps data within
 

155
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,750
gps data within
the files so again we have our

156
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
the files so again we have our
 

157
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,390
the files so again we have our
geolocation data

158
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
geolocation data
 

159
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,710
geolocation data
we can do cool things such as measure

160
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
we can do cool things such as measure
 

161
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,509
we can do cool things such as measure
distances

162
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
distances
 

163
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,390
distances
we can do different spot heights we can

164
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
we can do different spot heights we can
 

165
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,070
we can do different spot heights we can
do different locations you can pin

166
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
do different locations you can pin
 

167
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,710
do different locations you can pin
things

168
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
things
 

169
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,430
things
but this isn't just everything i'm going

170
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
but this isn't just everything i'm going
 

171
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,390
but this isn't just everything i'm going
to show you right now

172
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
to show you right now
 

173
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,990
to show you right now
no what we really want is this

174
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
no what we really want is this
 

175
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,869
no what we really want is this
and that is the 3d model of the

176
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
and that is the 3d model of the
 

177
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,830
and that is the 3d model of the
environment

178
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
environment
 

179
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,350
environment
all right this is what we're looking for

180
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
all right this is what we're looking for
 

181
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,509
all right this is what we're looking for
this is the cool

182
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
this is the cool
 

183
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,789
this is the cool
looking 3d map the 3d

184
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
looking 3d map the 3d
 

185
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,149
looking 3d map the 3d
model that we have been able to create

186
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
model that we have been able to create
 

187
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,949
model that we have been able to create
using our images that we've uploaded to

188
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
using our images that we've uploaded to
 

189
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,470
using our images that we've uploaded to
our program

190
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
our program
 

191
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,390
our program
so pretty much again we take our photos

192
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
so pretty much again we take our photos
 

193
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,630
so pretty much again we take our photos
the program stitches everything together

194
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
the program stitches everything together
 

195
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,149
the program stitches everything together
and it's able to create this

196
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
and it's able to create this
 

197
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,309
and it's able to create this
cool 3d file this 3d model

198
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
cool 3d file this 3d model
 

199
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,030
cool 3d file this 3d model
photogrammetry really is the future and

200
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
photogrammetry really is the future and
 

201
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,030
photogrammetry really is the future and
again it's not perfect like again going

202
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
again it's not perfect like again going
 

203
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,270
again it's not perfect like again going
closer into things we do have like a few

204
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
closer into things we do have like a few
 

205
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,350
closer into things we do have like a few
little weird nubs and a few little uh

206
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
little weird nubs and a few little uh
 

207
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,230
little weird nubs and a few little uh
errors

208
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
errors
 

209
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,749
errors
but again you can correct those in

210
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
but again you can correct those in
 

211
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,670
but again you can correct those in
blender or if you

212
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
blender or if you
 

213
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,749
blender or if you
pretty much the more advanced drone you

214
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
pretty much the more advanced drone you
 

215
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,230
pretty much the more advanced drone you
have also known as the better camera

216
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
have also known as the better camera
 

217
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,110
have also known as the better camera
if you have fleur or lidar or anything

218
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
if you have fleur or lidar or anything
 

219
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,990
if you have fleur or lidar or anything
that makes

220
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
that makes
 

221
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,310
that makes
a much better high resolution image a

222
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
a much better high resolution image a
 

223
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,670
a much better high resolution image a
more accurate image

224
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
more accurate image
 

225
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,909
more accurate image
but again today we're just using uh

226
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
but again today we're just using uh
 

227
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,909
but again today we're just using uh
standard off the uh

228
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
standard off the uh
 

229
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,310
standard off the uh
off the shelf drone so hey that that

230
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
off the shelf drone so hey that that
 

231
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,150
off the shelf drone so hey that that
that's still a pretty nice those are

232
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
that's still a pretty nice those are
 

233
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,070
that's still a pretty nice those are
some really sharp looking lines

234
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
some really sharp looking lines
 

235
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,749
some really sharp looking lines
so now what we can do is that we can

236
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
so now what we can do is that we can
 

237
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,830
so now what we can do is that we can
actually download this map

238
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
actually download this map
 

239
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,070
actually download this map
depending what program you're using and

240
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
depending what program you're using and
 

241
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,749
depending what program you're using and
we can

242
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
we can
 

243
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,469
we can
export this as an obj file or another

244
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
export this as an obj file or another
 

245
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,350
export this as an obj file or another
readable

246
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
readable
 

247
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,430
readable
3d file format and we can actually

248
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
3d file format and we can actually
 

249
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,909
3d file format and we can actually
import this into a 3d printer

250
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
import this into a 3d printer
 

251
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,230
import this into a 3d printer
so let's take a look at some images that

252
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
so let's take a look at some images that
 

253
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,670
so let's take a look at some images that
robbie gave us

254
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
robbie gave us
 

255
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,990
robbie gave us
of him converting one of my files i did

256
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
of him converting one of my files i did
 

257
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,029
of him converting one of my files i did
into a 3d model

258
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
into a 3d model
 

259
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,950
into a 3d model
all right so before we turn into a 3d

260
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
all right so before we turn into a 3d
 

261
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,710
all right so before we turn into a 3d
model i just wanted to show

262
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
model i just wanted to show
 

263
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,029
model i just wanted to show
what model i gave robbie so this is a

264
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
what model i gave robbie so this is a
 

265
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,710
what model i gave robbie so this is a
house we shot a few years ago you can

266
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
house we shot a few years ago you can
 

267
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,270
house we shot a few years ago you can
take a look at this on sketchfab.com

268
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
take a look at this on sketchfab.com
 

269
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,189
take a look at this on sketchfab.com
under air support aerial photography

270
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
under air support aerial photography
 

271
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,469
under air support aerial photography
that's my company

272
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
that's my company
 

273
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,990
that's my company
um but as you can see it's a really nice

274
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
um but as you can see it's a really nice
 

275
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,070
um but as you can see it's a really nice
looking home you know uh the resolution

276
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
looking home you know uh the resolution
 

277
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,830
looking home you know uh the resolution
is actually not that bad this was shot

278
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
is actually not that bad this was shot
 

279
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,230
is actually not that bad this was shot
with a phantom 3 professional

280
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
with a phantom 3 professional
 

281
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,150
with a phantom 3 professional
um again there are a few errors like

282
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
um again there are a few errors like
 

283
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,350
um again there are a few errors like
this section right here

284
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
this section right here
 

285
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,110
this section right here
so this is there was a tree right here

286
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
so this is there was a tree right here
 

287
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,029
so this is there was a tree right here
so we weren't able to get proper

288
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
so we weren't able to get proper
 

289
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,350
so we weren't able to get proper
photos that's why the program kind of

290
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
photos that's why the program kind of
 

291
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,189
photos that's why the program kind of
freaked out in this corner here

292
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
freaked out in this corner here
 

293
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,350
freaked out in this corner here
but everything else is pretty uh it did

294
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
but everything else is pretty uh it did
 

295
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,310
but everything else is pretty uh it did
a really nice job

296
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
a really nice job
 

297
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,189
a really nice job
and again the algorithms have become a

298
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
and again the algorithms have become a
 

299
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,950
and again the algorithms have become a
lot more accurate

300
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
lot more accurate
 

301
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,029
lot more accurate
uh these past few years so chances are

302
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
uh these past few years so chances are
 

303
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,309
uh these past few years so chances are
if we did this again it would be a lot

304
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
if we did this again it would be a lot
 

305
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,189
if we did this again it would be a lot
more accurate

306
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
more accurate
 

307
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,029
more accurate
even if we still use the phantom 3

308
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
even if we still use the phantom 3
 

309
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,029
even if we still use the phantom 3
camera and of course you can add other

310
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
camera and of course you can add other
 

311
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,469
camera and of course you can add other
details in like right here

312
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
details in like right here
 

313
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,950
details in like right here
just in blender or other programs so

314
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
just in blender or other programs so
 

315
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,550
just in blender or other programs so
let's see how

316
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
let's see how
 

317
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,909
let's see how
robbie's program takes this dot obj file

318
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
robbie's program takes this dot obj file
 

319
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,469
robbie's program takes this dot obj file
and turns it into a 3d printer readable

320
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
and turns it into a 3d printer readable
 

321
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,110
and turns it into a 3d printer readable
file

322
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
file
 

323
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,189
file
let's take a look thanks henry we're

324
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
let's take a look thanks henry we're
 

325
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,710
let's take a look thanks henry we're
going to dig into the software that's

326
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
going to dig into the software that's
 

327
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,390
going to dig into the software that's
used to convert henry's aerial

328
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400

so the object
 

367
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,909
so the object
just the actual 3d printing file

368
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
just the actual 3d printing file
 

369
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,230
just the actual 3d printing file
and bring that into cura and let's see

370
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
and bring that into cura and let's see
 

371
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,990
and bring that into cura and let's see
what we find now we got this little itty

you can see how that is so what i want
 

381
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,629
you can see how that is so what i want
to do is i want to rotate that

382
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
to do is i want to rotate that
 

383
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,909
to do is i want to rotate that
so i'm just going to click on it click

on the rotate tool and bring it down 90
 

387
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,029
on the rotate tool and bring it down 90
degrees

388
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
degrees

itty-bitty house for ants so let's
 

395
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,869
itty-bitty house for ants so let's
increase the size of that as well and

396
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
increase the size of that as well and
 

397
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,469
increase the size of that as well and
boop there we are so that's awfully big

like 200 millimeters let's bring it down

400
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
like 200 millimeters let's bring it down
 

401
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,589
like 200 millimeters let's bring it down
just a little bit

402
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
just a little bit
 

403
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,670
just a little bit
okay so the first thing that i notice

404
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
okay so the first thing that i notice
 

405
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,150
okay so the first thing that i notice
here is that we've got a lot of ground

406
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
here is that we've got a lot of ground
 

407

what i'm going to do is i'm just going

416
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
what i'm going to do is i'm just going
 

417
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,390
what i'm going to do is i'm just going
to lower

418
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
to lower
 

419
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,430
to lower
the position of the house a little bit

420
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
the position of the house a little bit
 

421
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,309
the position of the house a little bit
so that we can push that ground into the

422
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
so that we can push that ground into the
 

423
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,110
so that we can push that ground into the
build plate

424
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
build plate
 

425
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,110
build plate
on my printer i don't want to go too far

426
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
on my printer i don't want to go too far
 

427
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,790
on my printer i don't want to go too far
because we don't want to like submerge

428
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
because we don't want to like submerge
 

429
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,309
because we don't want to like submerge
the house we just want to

430
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
the house we just want to
 

431
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,790

pull back some of that that landscaping

432
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
pull back some of that that landscaping
 

433
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,230
pull back some of that that landscaping
there so that we're not actually 3d

434
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
there so that we're not actually 3d
 

435

there so that we're not actually 3d
printing

436

printing
 

437
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,749
printing
the dirt and there's that area where i

438
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
the dirt and there's that area where i
 

439
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,709
the dirt and there's that area where i
think that's

440
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
think that's
 

441
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,550
think that's
is that where the no yeah that's where

442

the tree where henry was showing us the

444
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
the tree where henry was showing us the
 

445
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,990
the tree where henry was showing us the
tree is

446
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
tree is
 

447
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,310
tree is
and it looks like a cave so that's going

448
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
and it looks like a cave so that's going
 

449
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,670
and it looks like a cave so that's going
to be rather interesting

450
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
to be rather interesting
 

451
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,149
to be rather interesting
a couple of quick mentions is you know

452
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
a couple of quick mentions is you know
 

453
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,870
a couple of quick mentions is you know
typically

454
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
typically
 

455
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,230
typically
when you're 3d printing you're going to

456
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
when you're 3d printing you're going to
 

457
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,550
when you're 3d printing you're going to
need supports if anything overhangs

458
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
need supports if anything overhangs
 

459
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,350
need supports if anything overhangs
because

460
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
because
 

461
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,790
because
otherwise it's just going to droop and

462
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
otherwise it's just going to droop and
 

463
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,150
otherwise it's just going to droop and
and you're going to get this stringing

464
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
and you're going to get this stringing
 

465
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,350
and you're going to get this stringing
coming down

466
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
coming down
 

467
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,269
coming down
so i'm looking for anything here that's

468
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
so i'm looking for anything here that's
 

469
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,509
so i'm looking for anything here that's
going to overhang and i don't really see

470
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
going to overhang and i don't really see
 

471
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,670
going to overhang and i don't really see
much there is this overhang here

472
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
much there is this overhang here
 

473
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,070
much there is this overhang here
and kira is showing me some red to to

474
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
and kira is showing me some red to to
 

475
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,790
and kira is showing me some red to to
tell me that

476
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
tell me that
 

477
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,550
tell me that
this might be a problem but i think

478
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
this might be a problem but i think
 

479
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,190
this might be a problem but i think
because it's such a small

480
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
because it's such a small
 

481
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,870
because it's such a small
overhang i think we're probably going to

482
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
overhang i think we're probably going to
 

483
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,590
overhang i think we're probably going to
be okay to do it without supports

484
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
be okay to do it without supports
 

485
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,269
be okay to do it without supports
we don't need supports you might think

486
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
we don't need supports you might think
 

487
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,110
we don't need supports you might think
well we need to support the roof because

488
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
well we need to support the roof because
 

489
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,910
well we need to support the roof because
you know the roof

490
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
you know the roof
 

491
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,470
you know the roof
is like this and if it's a hollow thing

492
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
is like this and if it's a hollow thing
 

493
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,269
is like this and if it's a hollow thing
then it's

494
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
then it's
 

495
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,590
then it's
uh it's going to you know completely

496
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
uh it's going to you know completely
 

497
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,470
uh it's going to you know completely
cave in

498
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
cave in
 

499
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,550
cave in
but the way kira looks at this when it's

500
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
but the way kira looks at this when it's
 

501
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,070
but the way kira looks at this when it's
slicing it is

502
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
slicing it is
 

503
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,430
slicing it is
it treats this as a solid object so

504
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
it treats this as a solid object so
 

505
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,750
it treats this as a solid object so
rather than supports for the interior of

506
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
rather than supports for the interior of
 

507
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,310
rather than supports for the interior of
the object that's actually called infill

508
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
the object that's actually called infill
 

509
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,430
the object that's actually called infill
so there's a couple of things that we're

510
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
so there's a couple of things that we're
 

511
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,110
so there's a couple of things that we're
going to set here so if we did need

512
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
going to set here so if we did need
 

513
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,310
going to set here so if we did need
supports we're going to click on

514
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
supports we're going to click on
 

515
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,590
supports we're going to click on
generate supports

516
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
generate supports
 

517
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,150
generate supports
i don't think we're going to if i

518
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
i don't think we're going to if i
 

519
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,430
i don't think we're going to if i
preview that

520
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
preview that
 

521
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,150
preview that
yeah see the whole outside has now been

522
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
yeah see the whole outside has now been
 

523
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,790
yeah see the whole outside has now been
basically

524
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
basically
 

525
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,190
basically
covered in supports so that would be a

526
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
covered in supports so that would be a
 

527
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,670
covered in supports so that would be a
lot of stuff to trim away

528
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
lot of stuff to trim away
 

529
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,470
lot of stuff to trim away
and i think that's because of the fact

530
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
and i think that's because of the fact
 

531
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,110
and i think that's because of the fact
that

532
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
that
 

533
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,350
that
being that it's a 3d scan using just a

534
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
being that it's a 3d scan using just a
 

535
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,790
being that it's a 3d scan using just a
standard camera

536
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
standard camera
 

537
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,990
standard camera
the edges are not quite perfect as

538
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
the edges are not quite perfect as
 

539
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,710
the edges are not quite perfect as
you've as you've seen there

540
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
you've as you've seen there
 

541
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,509
you've as you've seen there
so that's something that henry might

542
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
so that's something that henry might
 

543
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,630
so that's something that henry might
might want to clean up

544
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
might want to clean up
 

545
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,590
might want to clean up
before trying to 3d print let's turn off

546
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
before trying to 3d print let's turn off
 

547
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,430
before trying to 3d print let's turn off
the supports and i've got an infill

548
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
the supports and i've got an infill
 

549
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,269
the supports and i've got an infill
density of 20 percent

550
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
density of 20 percent
 

551
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,030
density of 20 percent
and we're looking at about 14 hours to

552
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
and we're looking at about 14 hours to
 

553
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,190
and we're looking at about 14 hours to
print with supports my fear is just that

554
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
print with supports my fear is just that
 

555
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,550
print with supports my fear is just that
that's a lot of supports to remove um

556
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
that's a lot of supports to remove um
 

557
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,030
that's a lot of supports to remove um
it might be very difficult now it's not

558
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
it might be very difficult now it's not
 

559
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,110
it might be very difficult now it's not
but it might be worth it

560
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
but it might be worth it
 

561
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,670
but it might be worth it
it's a hard thing to call this is what

562
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
it's a hard thing to call this is what
 

563
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,269
it's a hard thing to call this is what
it looks like without supports but what

564
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
it looks like without supports but what
 

565
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,350
it looks like without supports but what
i'm looking for is the infill density

566
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
i'm looking for is the infill density
 

567
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,670
i'm looking for is the infill density
to make sure that this the roof is going

568
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
to make sure that this the roof is going
 

569
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,870
to make sure that this the roof is going
to be supported so i'm going to pull

570
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
to be supported so i'm going to pull
 

571
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,389
to be supported so i'm going to pull
down my preview here

572
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
down my preview here
 

573
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,630
down my preview here
so that i can see inside what's being

574
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
so that i can see inside what's being
 

575
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,430
so that i can see inside what's being
printed

576
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
printed
 

577
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,630
printed
so you can see that with a twenty

578
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
so you can see that with a twenty
 

579
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,550
so you can see that with a twenty
percent infill density

580
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
percent infill density
 

581
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,670
percent infill density
that is placing these kind of

582
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
that is placing these kind of
 

583
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,670
that is placing these kind of
their supports to hold up that roof

584
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
their supports to hold up that roof
 

585
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,310
their supports to hold up that roof
as it prints but without using you know

586
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
as it prints but without using you know
 

587
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,430
as it prints but without using you know
100 infill

588
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
100 infill
 

589
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,990
100 infill
and wasting a whole lot of filament

590
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
and wasting a whole lot of filament
 

591
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,509
and wasting a whole lot of filament
that's going to take about 10 hours and

592
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
that's going to take about 10 hours and
 

593
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,430
that's going to take about 10 hours and
67 grams of filament

594
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
67 grams of filament
 

595
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,110
67 grams of filament
so if you're wondering well how much is

596
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
so if you're wondering well how much is
 

597
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,630
so if you're wondering well how much is
that going to cost to print at that

598
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
that going to cost to print at that
 

599
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,910
that going to cost to print at that
scale

600
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
scale
 

601
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,310
scale
just go into your calculator and i know

602
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
just go into your calculator and i know
 

603
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,350
just go into your calculator and i know
that i paid 40

604
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
that i paid 40
 

605
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,870
that i paid 40
for the one kilogram of filament so it's

606
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
for the one kilogram of filament so it's
 

607
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,269
for the one kilogram of filament so it's
4

608
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
4
 

609
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,590
4
cents per gram and we know that this is

610
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
cents per gram and we know that this is
 

611
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,269
cents per gram and we know that this is
going to be 67

612
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
going to be 67
 

613
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,389
going to be 67
grams so that's 2 dollars and 68 cents

614
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
grams so that's 2 dollars and 68 cents
 

615
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,990
grams so that's 2 dollars and 68 cents
to print at this scale and that's pretty

616
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
to print at this scale and that's pretty
 

617
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,470
to print at this scale and that's pretty
big considering my under 3

618
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
big considering my under 3
 

619
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,750
big considering my under 3
bed is 220 by 220 millimeters so what

620
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
bed is 220 by 220 millimeters so what
 

621
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:27,990
bed is 220 by 220 millimeters so what
you're

622
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
you're
 

623
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,870
you're
looking at there is uh you know it is

624
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
looking at there is uh you know it is
 

625
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,389
looking at there is uh you know it is
let's see

626
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:33,399
let's see
 

627
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,670
let's see
143 millimeters by 112 millimeters

628
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
143 millimeters by 112 millimeters
 

629
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,630
143 millimeters by 112 millimeters
so it's pretty big i'm gonna try scaling

630
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
so it's pretty big i'm gonna try scaling
 

631
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,350
so it's pretty big i'm gonna try scaling
it down a bit

632
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
it down a bit
 

633
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,870
it down a bit
so that the overhangs are not as big

634
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
so that the overhangs are not as big
 

635
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,910
so that the overhangs are not as big
as they would be if it was 143

636
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
as they would be if it was 143
 

637
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,350
as they would be if it was 143
millimeters wide

638
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
millimeters wide
 

639
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,750
millimeters wide
so i'm going to make this about 50

640
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
so i'm going to make this about 50
 

641
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,590
so i'm going to make this about 50
millimeters

642
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
millimeters
 

643
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,870
millimeters
width and see

644
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
width and see
 

645
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,389
width and see
how that slices up with no supports

646
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
how that slices up with no supports
 

647
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,550
how that slices up with no supports
so it's going to be a lot smaller but

648
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
so it's going to be a lot smaller but
 

649
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,509
so it's going to be a lot smaller but
it's going to

650
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
it's going to
 

651
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,590
it's going to
probably do a lot better without

652
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
probably do a lot better without
 

653
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,710
probably do a lot better without
supports because

654
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
supports because
 

655
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,910
supports because
we don't have such a pronounced overhang

656
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
we don't have such a pronounced overhang
 

657
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,190
we don't have such a pronounced overhang
and let's give that a go i'm going to

658
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
and let's give that a go i'm going to
 

659
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,110
and let's give that a go i'm going to
send that over to my printer

660
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
send that over to my printer
 

661
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,760
send that over to my printer
and we'll see how she comes out

662
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:14,770
and we'll see how she comes out
 

663
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:21,590
and we'll see how she comes out

in all seriousness though henry the
reason that i printed it so small

680
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
reason that i printed it so small
 

681
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,470
reason that i printed it so small
as i mentioned was i wanted to see if it

682
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
as i mentioned was i wanted to see if it
 

683
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,389
as i mentioned was i wanted to see if it
would print without supports and it did

684
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
would print without supports and it did
 

685
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,069
would print without supports and it did
and it printed quite nicely and it looks

686
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
and it printed quite nicely and it looks
 

687
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,790
and it printed quite nicely and it looks
pretty good

688

pretty good
 

689
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,069
pretty good

690
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
but it's very very tiny it is so i did
 

691
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,910
but it's very very tiny it is so i did
decide to take it to the next level for

kind of see i know that is pretty robust
 

713
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,110
kind of see i know that is pretty robust
i printed it in

714
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
i printed it in
 

715
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,870
i printed it in
white filament for you because i thought

716
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
white filament for you because i thought
 

717
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,310
white filament for you because i thought
hey maybe you'd want to prime it and

718
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
hey maybe you'd want to prime it and
 

719
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,190
hey maybe you'd want to prime it and
paint it

720
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
paint it
 

721
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,829
paint it
um but then i realized as i was running

722
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
um but then i realized as i was running
 

723
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,310
um but then i realized as i was running
it that

724
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
it that
 

725
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,750
it that
the cameras kind of don't like white

726
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
the cameras kind of don't like white
 

727
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,910
the cameras kind of don't like white
filament because they white balance

728
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
filament because they white balance
 

729
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,230
filament because they white balance
themselves and overexpose themselves

730
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
themselves and overexpose themselves
 

731
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,069
themselves and overexpose themselves

able to see is that literally we just
 

757
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,990
able to see is that literally we just
did our kind of grid patterns we were

758
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
did our kind of grid patterns we were
 

759
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,750
did our kind of grid patterns we were
able to take those photos

760
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
able to take those photos
 

761
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,509
able to take those photos
mash them all together in a blender and

762

and put it in a a 3d movie that you
 

817
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:34,949
and put it in a a 3d movie that you
create

818
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
create
 

819
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,110
create
you can you can even have a real engine

820
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
you can you can even have a real engine
 

821
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,310
you can you can even have a real engine
you could put yourself in it you could

822
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
you could put yourself in it you could
 

823
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,030
you could put yourself in it you could
so you could put it

824

so you could put it
 

825
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,949
so you could put it
you could put it in a game yeah so i've

826
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
you could put it in a game yeah so i've
 

827
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,949
you could put it in a game yeah so i've
actually had this exact same model

828
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
actually had this exact same model
 

829
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,870
actually had this exact same model
in unreal for running so like i could

830
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
in unreal for running so like i could
 

831
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,470
in unreal for running so like i could
have like little fires around it

832
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
have like little fires around it
 

833

could have like a sky box
 

837
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,910
could have like a sky box
so there's so many applications for this

838
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
so there's so many applications for this
 

839
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,230
so there's so many applications for this
cool i mean like again besides the 3d

840
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
cool i mean like again besides the 3d
 

841
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,230
cool i mean like again besides the 3d
environment so like video photo

842
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
environment so like video photo

landscapes or whatever
 

899
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,710
landscapes or whatever
in such a way that it will last forever

900
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
in such a way that it will last forever
 

901
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,470
in such a way that it will last forever
as you say you can throw it in an unreal

902
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
as you say you can throw it in an unreal
 

903
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,670
as you say you can throw it in an unreal
engine with the textures

904
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
engine with the textures
 

905
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,389
engine with the textures
exactly it will even if the building

906
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
exactly it will even if the building
 

907
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,509
exactly it will even if the building
disintegrates

973
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,069
the
with the textures and everything it was

974
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
with the textures and everything it was
 

975
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,310
with the textures and everything it was
it was very very real-looking that was

976
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
it was very very real-looking that was
 

977
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,670
it was very very real-looking that was
really fun and that was with an

978
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
really fun and that was with an
 

979
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,910
really fun and that was with an
older version of that program that that

980
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
older version of that program that that
 

981
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,509
older version of that program that that
the model that we used for this was

982
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
the model that we used for this was
 

983
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,269
the model that we used for this was
around three or four years old

984
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
around three or four years old
 

985
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,189
around three or four years old
okay so the methods that the programs

986
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
okay so the methods that the programs
 

987
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,350
okay so the methods that the programs
use now their algorithms are actually so

988
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
use now their algorithms are actually so
 

989
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,949
use now their algorithms are actually so
much more accurate and i'm using an

990
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
much more accurate and i'm using an
 

991
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,230
much more accurate and i'm using an
older drone right so

992
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
older drone right so
 

993
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,870
older drone right so
phantom 3 pro my friend uses a maverick

994
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
phantom 3 pro my friend uses a maverick
 

995
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,789
phantom 3 pro my friend uses a maverick
they have a matrix as well so like a 10

996
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
they have a matrix as well so like a 10
 

997
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,270
they have a matrix as well so like a 10

drone wow imagine how that looks having

1000
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
drone wow imagine how that looks having
 

1001
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,870
drone wow imagine how that looks having
like a full

1002
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
like a full

dslr camera unreal is this the same tech

1004
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
dslr camera unreal is this the same tech
 

1005
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,710
dslr camera unreal is this the same tech
like when i see on google earth yeah it

1006
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
like when i see on google earth yeah it
 

1007
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,069
like when i see on google earth yeah it
is it actually is

1008
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
is it actually is
 

1009
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,949
is it actually is
so um a lot of people think that um you

1010
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
so um a lot of people think that um you
 

1011
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,669
so um a lot of people think that um you
can even use

1012
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
can even use
 

1013
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,909
can even use
lidar or like floor things you which you

1014
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
lidar or like floor things you which you
 

1015
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,990
lidar or like floor things you which you
can and it makes more accurate

1016
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
can and it makes more accurate
 

1017
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,110
can and it makes more accurate
with using lidar and fleur but yeah so

1018
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
with using lidar and fleur but yeah so
 

1019
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,310
with using lidar and fleur but yeah so
google maps

1020
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,320
google maps
 

1021
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,950
google maps
bing maps those guys um they literally

1022
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
bing maps those guys um they literally
 

1023
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,549
bing maps those guys um they literally
just use photogrametry so they have

1024
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
just use photogrametry so they have
 

1025
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,750
just use photogrametry so they have
multiple pictures

1026
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
multiple pictures
 

1027
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,909
multiple pictures
from satellites yeah up in the grape

1028
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
from satellites yeah up in the grape
 

1029
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,510
from satellites yeah up in the grape
view blue yonder

1030
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
view blue yonder
 

1031
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,830
view blue yonder
and they have similar programs are able

1032
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
and they have similar programs are able
 

1033
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,430
and they have similar programs are able
to stitch that together they're using

1034
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
to stitch that together they're using
 

1035
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,990
to stitch that together they're using
satellite

1036
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
satellite
 

1037
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,270
satellite
imagery to do what you're doing with a

1038
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
imagery to do what you're doing with a
 

1039
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,470
imagery to do what you're doing with a
drone it's pretty much this but on

1040
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
drone it's pretty much this but on
 

1041
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,150
drone it's pretty much this but on
steroids yeah so

1042
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
steroids yeah so
 

1043
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,150
steroids yeah so
using a drone they're using satellites

1044
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
using a drone they're using satellites
 

1045
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,669
using a drone they're using satellites
and using uh

1046
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
and using uh
 

1047
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,710
and using uh
amazing data putting things together

1048
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
amazing data putting things together
 

1049
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,390
amazing data putting things together
and yeah so whenever you see your house

1050
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
and yeah so whenever you see your house
 

1051
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,070
and yeah so whenever you see your house
on google earth and of course there are

1052
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
on google earth and of course there are
 

1053
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,669
on google earth and of course there are
some ai um like some

1054
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
some ai um like some
 

1055
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,150
some ai um like some
ais are fixing a few errors here and

1056
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
ais are fixing a few errors here and
 

1057
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,870
ais are fixing a few errors here and
there but

1058
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
there but
 

1059
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,390
there but
when it comes down to it yeah that's the

1060
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
when it comes down to it yeah that's the
 

1061
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,150
when it comes down to it yeah that's the
basics of how uh

1062
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
basics of how uh
 

1063
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,350
basics of how uh
a lot of these companies are doing

1064
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
a lot of these companies are doing
 

1065
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,190
a lot of these companies are doing
things now cool stuff so yeah

1066
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
things now cool stuff so yeah
 

1067
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,110
things now cool stuff so yeah
i'm really keen to see how this brings

1068
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
i'm really keen to see how this brings
 

1069
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,870
i'm really keen to see how this brings
real world objects into

1070
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
real world objects into
 

1071
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,190
real world objects into
same here things like video games like i

1072
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
same here things like video games like i
 

1073
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,909
same here things like video games like i
really think

1074
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
really think
 

1075
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,070
really think
with virtual reality to be able to well

1076
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
with virtual reality to be able to well
 

1077
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,830
with virtual reality to be able to well
we actually already see this um a famous

1078
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
we actually already see this um a famous
 

1079
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,029
we actually already see this um a famous
one that just came out is the new

1080
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
one that just came out is the new
 

1081
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,710
one that just came out is the new
microsoft light sim right there

1082
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
microsoft light sim right there
 

1083
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,789
microsoft light sim right there
the entire 3d world is just big maps

1084
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
the entire 3d world is just big maps
 

1085
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,950
the entire 3d world is just big maps
but it's just in a 3d environment and

1086
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
but it's just in a 3d environment and
 

1087
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,710
but it's just in a 3d environment and
for years we've always had flights in

1088
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
for years we've always had flights in
 

1089
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,070
for years we've always had flights in
google earth where you just use your

1090
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
google earth where you just use your
 

1091
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,390
google earth where you just use your
arrow keys but that's not a flight sim

1092
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
arrow keys but that's not a flight sim
 

1093
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,710
arrow keys but that's not a flight sim
but

1094
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
but
 

1095
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,549
but
it's it's amazing to see where we're

1096
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
it's it's amazing to see where we're
 

1097
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,990
it's it's amazing to see where we're
going with this technology

1098
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
going with this technology
 

1099
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,270
going with this technology
very cool so yeah very cool uh where can

1100
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
very cool so yeah very cool uh where can
 

1101
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,950
very cool so yeah very cool uh where can
