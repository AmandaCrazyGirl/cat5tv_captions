00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
year ago they released the raspberry pi
 

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,510
year ago they released the raspberry pi
4 and the raspberry pi 4 is kind of a

raspberry pi was a great tinkering board
 

19
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,390
raspberry pi was a great tinkering board
it was something that's a lot of fun for

20
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
it was something that's a lot of fun for
 

21
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,990
it was something that's a lot of fun for
makers and tinkerers

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
makers and tinkerers
 

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,830
makers and tinkerers
and and you know people that just want

24
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
and and you know people that just want
 

25
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,430

retropie
 

35
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,750
retropie
does very very well yeah but with the

36
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
does very very well yeah but with the
 

37
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,869
does very very well yeah but with the
raspberry pi 4

38
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
raspberry pi 4
 

39
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,590
raspberry pi 4
of course it brought it into more of a

40
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
of course it brought it into more of a
 

41
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,310
of course it brought it into more of a
hey this is

42
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
hey this is
 

43
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,350
hey this is
almost as good as a you know entry level

44
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
almost as good as a you know entry level
 

45
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,830
almost as good as a you know entry level
desktop computer on a single board

49
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,549
computer
so with that set if you can use a single

50
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
so with that set if you can use a single
 

51
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,389
so with that set if you can use a single
board computer in place of a desktop

52
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
board computer in place of a desktop
 

53
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,510
board computer in place of a desktop
computer

54
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
computer
 

55
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,670
computer
what's next right so you could do that

56
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
what's next right so you could do that
 

57
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,390
what's next right so you could do that
and i wanna you know i wanna be brutally

58
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
and i wanna you know i wanna be brutally
 

59
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,990
and i wanna you know i wanna be brutally
honest with you i mean it's a single

60
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
honest with you i mean it's a single
 

61
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,750
honest with you i mean it's a single
board computer still through and through

62
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
board computer still through and through
 

63
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,910
board computer still through and through
absolutely but we're talking like it

64
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:11,920
absolutely but we're talking like it
 

65
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,390
absolutely but we're talking like it
might have four or eight gigs of ram

66
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
might have four or eight gigs of ram
 

67
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,070
might have four or eight gigs of ram
which is really good for a single board

68
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
which is really good for a single board
 

69
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,310
which is really good for a single board
computer makes for a decent

70
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
computer makes for a decent
 

71
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,109
computer makes for a decent
like office processor that's exactly

72
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
like office processor that's exactly
 

73
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,630
like office processor that's exactly
right yeah like if you're just using it

74
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
right yeah like if you're just using it
 

75
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:22,950
right yeah like if you're just using it
to

76
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
to
 

77
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,950
to
to get online do your facebook and do

78
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
to get online do your facebook and do
 

79
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,390
to get online do your facebook and do
your social media

phenomenal watch the occasional video
 

83
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,910
phenomenal watch the occasional video
online it's good for that

84
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
online it's good for that
 

85
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,510
online it's good for that
too as long as you've got the right

86
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
too as long as you've got the right
 

87
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,149
too as long as you've got the right
setup but i think that's where people

88
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
setup but i think that's where people
 

89
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,350
setup but i think that's where people
get hung up with these

90
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
get hung up with these
 

91
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,950
get hung up with these
types of boards is that they're not

92
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
types of boards is that they're not
 

93
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,789
types of boards is that they're not
built for multimedia

94
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
built for multimedia
 

95
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,429
built for multimedia
or at least they're not well support

96
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
or at least they're not well support
 

97
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,950
or at least they're not well support
there's not a great deal of support for

yet correct you talk about retro gaming

102
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
yet correct you talk about retro gaming
 

103
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,990
yet correct you talk about retro gaming
and retro gaming does really really well

104
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
and retro gaming does really really well
 

105
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,670
and retro gaming does really really well
because it's based on technology from 10

106
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
because it's based on technology from 10
 

107
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,030
because it's based on technology from 10
15 years ago that's right

108
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
15 years ago that's right
 

109
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,910
15 years ago that's right
so does very well on a raspberry pi but

110
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
so does very well on a raspberry pi but
 

111
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,749
so does very well on a raspberry pi but
it hasn't caught up to

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
has evolved into what's called the
 

167
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,790
has evolved into what's called the
raspberry pi 400.

168
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
raspberry pi 400.
 

169
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,229
raspberry pi 400.
so it is a raspberry pi 4 at its heart

170
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
so it is a raspberry pi 4 at its heart
 

171
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,470
so it is a raspberry pi 4 at its heart
it's been you know they've rearranged

172
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
it's been you know they've rearranged
 

173
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,309
it's been you know they've rearranged
the board in order to make it fit within

174
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
the board in order to make it fit within
 

175
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,589
the board in order to make it fit within
this chassis

176
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
this chassis
 

177
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,830
this chassis
and you know it takes me back to

178
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840
and you know it takes me back to
 

179
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,910
and you know it takes me back to
the kind of mid-80s

180
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
the kind of mid-80s
 

181
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,110
the kind of mid-80s
um i guess when i had a vic-20 which was

182
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
um i guess when i had a vic-20 which was
 

183
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,229
um i guess when i had a vic-20 which was
a keyboard

184
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
a keyboard
 

185
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,710
a keyboard
computer that's right and like that was

186
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
computer that's right and like that was
 

187
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,390
computer that's right and like that was
one of my first computers

188
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
one of my first computers
 

189
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,309
one of my first computers
and you know you think about the amiga

190
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
and you know you think about the amiga
 

191

have been
 

201
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,070
have been
projects where people can 3d print their

202
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
projects where people can 3d print their
 

203
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,990
projects where people can 3d print their
own raspberry pi

form factor it is literally a keyboard
 

225
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,869
form factor it is literally a keyboard
that is the computer

226
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
that is the computer
 

227
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,149
that is the computer
if you don't mind the fact that it's got

228
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
if you don't mind the fact that it's got
 

229
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,149
if you don't mind the fact that it's got
some cables coming out of it and

230
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
some cables coming out of it and
 

231
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,229
some cables coming out of it and
and you got to set a monitor up then

232
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
and you got to set a monitor up then
 

233
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,910
and you got to set a monitor up then
you're going to do just fine with this

234
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
you're going to do just fine with this
 

235
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,509
you're going to do just fine with this
but it's not like the raspberry pi that

236
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
but it's not like the raspberry pi that
 

237
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,949
but it's not like the raspberry pi that
you'll stick on the back of a tv and it

238

you'll stick on the back of a tv and it
 

239
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,990
you'll stick on the back of a tv and it
just operates

this is like that but small this is a
 

253
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,949
this is like that but small this is a
lot sleeker

254
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
lot sleeker
 

255
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,030
lot sleeker
that doesn't so i had taken a big old

256
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
that doesn't so i had taken a big old
 

257

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
we got the power supply usbc
 

347
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,150
we got the power supply usbc
and that of course is 5.1 volts

348
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
and that of course is 5.1 volts
 

349
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,189
and that of course is 5.1 volts
3 amps and that's going to power this

350
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
3 amps and that's going to power this

quite significant uh there's a really
 

421
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,510
quite significant uh there's a really
large heat sink in there that's keeping

422
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
large heat sink in there that's keeping
 

423
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,270
large heat sink in there that's keeping
the thing cool so they've overclocked it

424
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
the thing cool so they've overclocked it
 

425
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,430
the thing cool so they've overclocked it
to 1.8 gigahertz out of the box

426
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
to 1.8 gigahertz out of the box
 

427
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,550
to 1.8 gigahertz out of the box
oh cool which is lovely and as you can

see
 

431
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,550
see
just sleek form factor

432
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
just sleek form factor
 

433
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,870
just sleek form factor
so it's even smaller than my vic-20 but

434
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
so it's even smaller than my vic-20 but
 

435
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,150
so it's even smaller than my vic-20 but
it's super

436

it's super
super powerful it's

438
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
super powerful it's
 

439
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,749
super powerful it's
not it's not that thick either which is

440
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
not it's not that thick either which is
 

441
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,270
not it's not that thick either which is
no that's what i mean like sleek

442
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
no that's what i mean like sleek
 

443
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,309
no that's what i mean like sleek
form factor just great i would have

444
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
form factor just great i would have
 

445
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,110
form factor just great i would have
thought

446
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
thought
 

447
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,710
thought
because i mean you used to the raspberry

448
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
because i mean you used to the raspberry
 

449
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,869
because i mean you used to the raspberry
pi you know it sits up that high i

450
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
pi you know it sits up that high i
 

451
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,150
pi you know it sits up that high i
thought it was going to be a much bigger

452
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
thought it was going to be a much bigger
 

453
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,950
thought it was going to be a much bigger
keyboard but

454
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
keyboard but
 

455
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,029
keyboard but
no they've really they've really just

456
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
no they've really they've really just
 

457
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,390
no they've really they've really just
shrunk it down that's nice

458
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
shrunk it down that's nice
 

459
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,270
shrunk it down that's nice
yeah yeah um just like a raspberry pi 4

460
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
yeah yeah um just like a raspberry pi 4
 

461
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,909
yeah yeah um just like a raspberry pi 4
you've got bluetooth 5 you've got your

462
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
you've got bluetooth 5 you've got your
 

463
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,790
you've got bluetooth 5 you've got your
wi-fi gigabit ethernet i'm going to be

464
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
wi-fi gigabit ethernet i'm going to be
 

465
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,270
wi-fi gigabit ethernet i'm going to be
using it on wi-fi today

466
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
using it on wi-fi today
 

467
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,749
using it on wi-fi today
and it just fires right up and ready to

468
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
and it just fires right up and ready to
 

469
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,029
and it just fires right up and ready to
go so should we do that

470
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
go so should we do that
 

471
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,830
go so should we do that
absolutely let's fire it up

472
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840

 

473
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,830

well here we are raspberry pi os came

474
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
well here we are raspberry pi os came
 

475
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,390
well here we are raspberry pi os came
pre-installed

476
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
pre-installed
 

477
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,469
pre-installed
at first boot i had to just kind of go

478
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
at first boot i had to just kind of go
 

479
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,749
at first boot i had to just kind of go
through the initial setup

813
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,629
going to want to stick with h.264
but it did play h.265

814
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
but it did play h.265
 

815
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,870

i'd probably go with ethernet though

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
i'd probably go with ethernet though
 

817
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,750
i'd probably go with ethernet though
because as you know

818
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
because as you know
 

819
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,629
because as you know
wi-fi with h.265 is probably going to

820
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
wi-fi with h.265 is probably going to
 

821
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,550
wi-fi with h.265 is probably going to
have some hiccups

822
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
have some hiccups
 

823
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,389
have some hiccups
that works great the one thing that i

the raspberry pi
 

841
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,870
the raspberry pi
because remember this is a raspberry pi

842
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
because remember this is a raspberry pi
 

843
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,949
because remember this is a raspberry pi
4 right so lots of people have already

but
 

851
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,750

that is
 

861
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,310
that is
built for drm so then you can use things

862
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
built for drm so then you can use things
 

863
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,710

everything works pretty good out of the

866
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
everything works pretty good out of the
 

867
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,629
everything works pretty good out of the
box

868
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639

 

869
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,910

pretty nice right yeah um so

870
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
pretty nice right yeah um so
 

871
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,509
pretty nice right yeah um so
as far as i'm concerned you know is this

872
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
as far as i'm concerned you know is this
 

873
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,509
as far as i'm concerned you know is this
a gaming system no is this a

874
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
a gaming system no is this a
 

875
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,870
a gaming system no is this a
multimedia system no not really um

876
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
multimedia system no not really um
 

877
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,550
multimedia system no not really um
but i'll say we use um an android box

878
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
but i'll say we use um an android box
 

879
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,990
but i'll say we use um an android box
at home for our tv and i disconnected

880
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
at home for our tv and i disconnected
 

881
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,150
at home for our tv and i disconnected
that and plugged this in in its place

882
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
that and plugged this in in its place
 

883
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,430
that and plugged this in in its place
and this was performing better than our

884
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
and this was performing better than our
 

885
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,710
and this was performing better than our
one-year-old

886
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
one-year-old
 

887
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,110
one-year-old
oh really box yeah so for multimedia

888
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
oh really box yeah so for multimedia
 

889
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,189
oh really box yeah so for multimedia
even it was doing a better job than the

890
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
even it was doing a better job than the
 

891
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,550
even it was doing a better job than the
android box and i think

892
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
android box and i think
 

893
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,870
android box and i think
that the the family can really

894
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
that the the family can really
 

895
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,110
that the the family can really
appreciate it a little more because

896
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
appreciate it a little more because
 

897
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,829
appreciate it a little more because
uh the form like the kind of the the way

898
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
uh the form like the kind of the the way
 

899
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,470
uh the form like the kind of the the way
that it

900
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
that it
 

901
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,030
that it
the i guess the desktop paradigm is more

902
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
the i guess the desktop paradigm is more
 

903
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,350
the i guess the desktop paradigm is more
like a computer than an android tv

904
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
like a computer than an android tv
 

905
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,350
like a computer than an android tv
so you're actually using an interface

906
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
so you're actually using an interface
 

907
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,870
so you're actually using an interface
that where you're bringing up a browser

908
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
that where you're bringing up a browser
 

909
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,590
that where you're bringing up a browser
and you're

910
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
and you're
 

911
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,150
and you're
able to install applications and linux

912
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
able to install applications and linux
 

913
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,910
able to install applications and linux
software and things like that so

914
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
software and things like that so
 

915
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,829
software and things like that so
it is a really robust system works great

916
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
it is a really robust system works great
 

917
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:35,990
it is a really robust system works great
um

918
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
um
 

919
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,829
um
i mean that's that's really all there is

920
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
i mean that's that's really all there is
 

921
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,269
i mean that's that's really all there is
to it right like does it work

922
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
to it right like does it work
 

923
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,749
to it right like does it work
yeah it is a raspberry pi 4 though so if

924
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
yeah it is a raspberry pi 4 though so if
 

925
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,430
yeah it is a raspberry pi 4 though so if
i was going to use this as a set top box

926
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
i was going to use this as a set top box
 

927
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,269
i was going to use this as a set top box
i would just go with a raspberry pi 4

928
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
i would just go with a raspberry pi 4
 

929
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,389
i would just go with a raspberry pi 4
right overclock it to 1.8 gigahertz to

930
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
right overclock it to 1.8 gigahertz to
 

931
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,310
right overclock it to 1.8 gigahertz to
match the speed of this um

932
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
match the speed of this um
 

933
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,829
match the speed of this um
and and that's not really a selling

934
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
and and that's not really a selling
 

935
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,670
and and that's not really a selling
point remember that overclocking can be

936
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
point remember that overclocking can be
 

937
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,870
point remember that overclocking can be
done anyways so

938
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
done anyways so
 

939
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,110
done anyways so
whether you have a raspberry pi 4 at 1.5

940
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
whether you have a raspberry pi 4 at 1.5
 

941
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,069
whether you have a raspberry pi 4 at 1.5
gigahertz

942
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
gigahertz
 

943
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,670
gigahertz
or a raspberry pi 400 at 1.8

944
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
or a raspberry pi 400 at 1.8
 

945
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,990
or a raspberry pi 400 at 1.8
it looks like a selling feature on paper

946
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
it looks like a selling feature on paper
 

947
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,829
it looks like a selling feature on paper
but it's just a setting in the operating

948
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
but it's just a setting in the operating
 

949
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,949
but it's just a setting in the operating
system so

950
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
system so
 

951
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,710
system so
you can take that raspberry pi 4 and

952
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
you can take that raspberry pi 4 and
 

953
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,189
you can take that raspberry pi 4 and
bump it up to 1.8 as well so

954
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
bump it up to 1.8 as well so
 

955
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,949
bump it up to 1.8 as well so
pretty clever marketing i must say

956
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
pretty clever marketing i must say
 

957
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,630
pretty clever marketing i must say
because those who don't understand

958
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
because those who don't understand
 

959
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,390
because those who don't understand
how overclocking works will think this

960
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
how overclocking works will think this
 

961
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,230
how overclocking works will think this
is faster well it's not

962
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
is faster well it's not
 

963
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,350
is faster well it's not
it's the exact same soc so

964
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360
it's the exact same soc so
 

965
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,909
it's the exact same soc so
all right let's jump back over so i mean

966
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
all right let's jump back over so i mean
 

967
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,909
all right let's jump back over so i mean
all in all i'm pretty impressed with it

968
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
all in all i'm pretty impressed with it
 

969
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,990
all in all i'm pretty impressed with it
i like it as i mentioned it's a little

970
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
i like it as i mentioned it's a little
 

971
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,750
i like it as i mentioned it's a little
bit on the gimmicky side but i'm

972
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760

a
you know the raspberry pi just connect

1010
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
you know the raspberry pi just connect
 

1011
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,029
you know the raspberry pi just connect
it to the tv well yeah you can do that

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
because of the form factor you can just
 

1017
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,630
because of the form factor you can just
disconnect it and put it away when

here at the studio i think
 

1043
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,430
here at the studio i think
we may just keep it set up um pretty
