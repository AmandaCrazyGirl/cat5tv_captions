00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,790

i've run the fio tests on all the drives

332
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
i've run the fio tests on all the drives
 

333
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,469
i've run the fio tests on all the drives
and i've passed the numbers on to the

334
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
and i've passed the numbers on to the
 

335
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:26,870
and i've passed the numbers on to the
team

336
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
team
 

337
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,710
team
at kingston so they can help make sense

338
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
at kingston so they can help make sense
 

339
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,909
at kingston so they can help make sense
of the test results

340
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
of the test results
 

341
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,270
of the test results
and here's what those numbers look like

342
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
and here's what those numbers look like
 

343
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,550
and here's what those numbers look like
so in the middle column there i've got

344
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
so in the middle column there i've got
 

345
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,110
so in the middle column there i've got
the four

that the speed
 

377
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,629
that the speed
is significantly improved on the ssds

uh but i interface a lot with uh clients

398
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
uh but i interface a lot with uh clients
 

399
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,189
uh but i interface a lot with uh clients
and users at data centers

400
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
and users at data centers
 

401
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,150
and users at data centers
um i also you know in my background i i

402
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
um i also you know in my background i i
 

403
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,390
um i also you know in my background i i
used to work for autodesk uh in the film

404
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
used to work for autodesk uh in the film
 

405
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,950
used to work for autodesk uh in the film
and

406
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
and
 

407
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,150
and
video industry um and dealt with like

408
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
video industry um and dealt with like
 

409
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,870
video industry um and dealt with like
sort of

410
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
sort of
 

411
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,950
sort of
everything from the desktop application

412
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
everything from the desktop application
 

413
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,550
everything from the desktop application
back to the data center you know

414
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
back to the data center you know
 

415
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,869
back to the data center you know
uh so if you if you break a bottleneck

416
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
uh so if you if you break a bottleneck
 

417
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,230
uh so if you if you break a bottleneck
at the desktop

418
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
at the desktop
 

419
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,830
at the desktop
you know then your next bottleneck is

420
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
you know then your next bottleneck is
 

421
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,430
you know then your next bottleneck is
the network and once you break that then

422
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
the network and once you break that then
 

423
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,430
the network and once you break that then
your bottleneck is on the server

424
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
your bottleneck is on the server
 

425
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,670
your bottleneck is on the server
and so um just basically trying to

426
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
and so um just basically trying to
 

427
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,110
and so um just basically trying to
troubleshoot and

428
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
troubleshoot and
 

429
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,029
troubleshoot and
and break bottlenecks whether it's you

430
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
and break bottlenecks whether it's you
 

431
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,309
and break bottlenecks whether it's you
know uh

432
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
know uh
 

433
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,309
know uh
databases or you know uh

434
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
databases or you know uh
 

435
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,430
databases or you know uh
8k video editing systems uh things like

436
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
8k video editing systems uh things like
 

437
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,990
8k video editing systems uh things like
that

438
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
that
 

439
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,390
that
they all need big fast data going

440
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
they all need big fast data going
 

441
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,110
they all need big fast data going
through pipes

442
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
through pipes
 

443
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,230
through pipes
don't i know it don't i know it oh yeah

444
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
don't i know it don't i know it oh yeah
 

445
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,670
don't i know it don't i know it oh yeah
so you've seen that's quite a setup you

446
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
so you've seen that's quite a setup you
 

447
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,670
so you've seen that's quite a setup you
got there cheers yeah well and you've

448
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
got there cheers yeah well and you've
 

449
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,350
got there cheers yeah well and you've
seen our file numbers from

450
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
seen our file numbers from
 

451
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,790
seen our file numbers from
our test today um and i i do realize

452
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
our test today um and i i do realize
 

453
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,189
our test today um and i i do realize
that

454
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
that
 

455
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,230
that
those numbers are slightly arbitrary um

456
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
those numbers are slightly arbitrary um
 

457
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,950
those numbers are slightly arbitrary um
however what i did is i ran the same

458
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
however what i did is i ran the same
 

459
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,350
however what i did is i ran the same
test

460
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
test
 

461
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,749
test
against the same scenario on our old

462
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
against the same scenario on our old
 

463
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,950
against the same scenario on our old
spinning drives

464
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
spinning drives
 

465
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,149
spinning drives
as i did on dc500rs so

466
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
as i did on dc500rs so
 

467
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,589
as i did on dc500rs so
just looking at those numbers can you

468
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
just looking at those numbers can you
 

469
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,190
just looking at those numbers can you
help us to make sense of

470
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
help us to make sense of
 

471
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,149
help us to make sense of
what's what's actually happening there

472
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
what's what's actually happening there
 

473
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,550
what's what's actually happening there
uh

474
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
uh
 

475
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,670
uh
okay yeah so uh you know

476
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
okay yeah so uh you know
 

477
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,550
okay yeah so uh you know
first of all both you know both the ssds

478
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
first of all both you know both the ssds
 

479
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,070
first of all both you know both the ssds
and the hard drives are

480
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
and the hard drives are
 

481
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,710
and the hard drives are
connected to the sata bus right same

482
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
connected to the sata bus right same
 

483
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,350

all the hardware is the same just the
 

487
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,670
all the hardware is the same just the
drives have changed yeah

488
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
drives have changed yeah
 

489
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,430
drives have changed yeah
the sata bus is one of the older um

490
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
the sata bus is one of the older um

computer
uh and and it has uh you know

496
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
uh and and it has uh you know
 

497
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,230
uh and and it has uh you know
a few uh weaknesses and that uh sort of

498
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
a few uh weaknesses and that uh sort of
 

499
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,389
a few uh weaknesses and that uh sort of
you can only be reading or writing to it

500
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
you can only be reading or writing to it
 

501
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,829
you can only be reading or writing to it
at any one time

502
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
at any one time
 

503
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,829
at any one time
uh but you know with raid controllers

504
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
uh but you know with raid controllers
 

505
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,430
uh but you know with raid controllers
and that they've gotten really good at

506
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
and that they've gotten really good at
 

507
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,350
and that they've gotten really good at
being able to optimize that

508
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
being able to optimize that
 

509
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,590
being able to optimize that
uh the best way possible so then you

510
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
uh the best way possible so then you
 

511
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,949
uh the best way possible so then you
come down to the

512
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
come down to the
 

513
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,070
come down to the
raw you know interface

514
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080

and you know s's
 

521
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,790
and you know s's
ssds have been modified you know it's a

522
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
ssds have been modified you know it's a
 

523
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,670
ssds have been modified you know it's a
a solid-state disk it's basically you've

524
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
a solid-state disk it's basically you've
 

525
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,750
a solid-state disk it's basically you've
got computer memory nand that

526
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
got computer memory nand that
 

527
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,269
got computer memory nand that
is being uh routed to speak uh

528
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
is being uh routed to speak uh
 

529
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,110
is being uh routed to speak uh
disk language right and so uh

530
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
disk language right and so uh
 

531
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,990

in a way you're sort of uh hobbling the

making it go through
 

539
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,269
making it go through
the uh uh sata interface but

00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
the uh uh sata interface but
 

541
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,389
the uh uh sata interface but
uh it has to pretend that it is uh it

595
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,509
performance
um you know the ssds are

596
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
um you know the ssds are
 

597
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,550
um you know the ssds are
anywhere between like on the read

598
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
anywhere between like on the read
 

599
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,030
anywhere between like on the read
maybe four times faster than uh the

rate of hard drives that you have going

604
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
rate of hard drives that you have going
 

605
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,509
rate of hard drives that you have going
right um this is also

606
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
right um this is also
 

607
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,110
right um this is also
you're doing raid five so there's a

608
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
you're doing raid five so there's a
 

609
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,389
you're doing raid five so there's a
little bit of overhead with disk

610
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
little bit of overhead with disk
 

611
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,509
little bit of overhead with disk
management so

612
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
management so
 

613
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,470
management so
if you did raid zero on both the ssds

614
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
if you did raid zero on both the ssds
 

615
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,269
if you did raid zero on both the ssds
and

616
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
and
 

617
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,310
and
i need redundancy yeah yeah yeah you

618
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
i need redundancy yeah yeah yeah you
 

619
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,910
i need redundancy yeah yeah yeah you
have no redundancy but if you do raid

620
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
have no redundancy but if you do raid
 

621
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,790
have no redundancy but if you do raid
zero you know then

622
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
zero you know then
 

623
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,790
zero you know then
you can see raw bandwidth sure uh

624
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
you can see raw bandwidth sure uh
 

625
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,910
you can see raw bandwidth sure uh
happening right yeah

626
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
happening right yeah
 

627
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,710
happening right yeah
uh but and and that that's when ssds

628
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
uh but and and that that's when ssds
 

629
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,350
uh but and and that that's when ssds
would even

630
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
would even
 

631
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,069
would even
take a step above you know sad ssds

632
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
take a step above you know sad ssds
 

633
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,430
take a step above you know sad ssds
would be even faster

634
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
would be even faster
 

635
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,310
would be even faster
uh without that redundancy happening

636
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
uh without that redundancy happening
 

637
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,990
uh without that redundancy happening
because there's a certain amount of uh

638
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
because there's a certain amount of uh
 

639
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,069
because there's a certain amount of uh
overhead that's happening to to do that

640
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
overhead that's happening to to do that
 

641
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,470
overhead that's happening to to do that
but even with your raid 5 setup

642
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
but even with your raid 5 setup
 

643
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,710
but even with your raid 5 setup
you're still looking at about three

644
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
you're still looking at about three
 

645
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,590
you're still looking at about three
times faster

646
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
times faster
 

647
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,030
times faster
for ssds than hard drives uh

648
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
for ssds than hard drives uh
 

649
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,069
for ssds than hard drives uh
on uh on a re on a

650
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
on uh on a re on a
 

651
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,269
on uh on a re on a
right and four times faster on the read

652
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
right and four times faster on the read
 

653
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,990
right and four times faster on the read
uh typically but the the one sort of

654
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
uh typically but the the one sort of
 

655
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,670
uh typically but the the one sort of
secret place that it ends up being much

656
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
secret place that it ends up being much
 

657
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,629
secret place that it ends up being much
much faster

658
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
much faster
 

659
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,310
much faster
is uh in the latency so that's like the

660
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
is uh in the latency so that's like the
 

661
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,829
is uh in the latency so that's like the
time between when i click

662
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
time between when i click
 

663
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,870
time between when i click
and submit a request to the time that uh

664
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
and submit a request to the time that uh
 

665
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,590
and submit a request to the time that uh
it actually

666
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
it actually
 

667
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,190
it actually
starts happening right um if

668
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
starts happening right um if
 

669
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,389
starts happening right um if
if it's like a random io

670
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
if it's like a random io
 

671
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,990
if it's like a random io
event it might be you know

672
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
event it might be you know
 

673
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,350
event it might be you know
when your drives are warmed up and

674
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
when your drives are warmed up and
 

675
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,509
when your drives are warmed up and
everything it might be uh

676
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
everything it might be uh
 

677
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,670
everything it might be uh
like 0.8 milliseconds to 1.2

678
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
like 0.8 milliseconds to 1.2
 

679
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,350
like 0.8 milliseconds to 1.2
milliseconds depending

680
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
milliseconds depending
 

681
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,470
milliseconds depending
uh whereas on the ssd it's going to be

682
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
uh whereas on the ssd it's going to be
 

683
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,389
uh whereas on the ssd it's going to be
microseconds so even if it's 20

684
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
microseconds so even if it's 20
 

685
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,750
microseconds so even if it's 20
microseconds

686
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
microseconds
 

687
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,389
microseconds
uh and you have a rate of four drives if

688
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
uh and you have a rate of four drives if
 

689
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,470
uh and you have a rate of four drives if
you say that your average latency per

690
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
you say that your average latency per
 

691
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,310
you say that your average latency per
drive was one millisecond on a hard

692
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
drive was one millisecond on a hard
 

693
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,110
drive was one millisecond on a hard
drive

694
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
drive
 

695
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,629
drive
and it's like 20 microseconds on the ssd

696
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
and it's like 20 microseconds on the ssd
 

697
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,710
and it's like 20 microseconds on the ssd
then uh you haven't even gotten to a

698
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
then uh you haven't even gotten to a
 

699
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,710
then uh you haven't even gotten to a
microsecond by the time you add up that

700
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
microsecond by the time you add up that
 

701
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,829
microsecond by the time you add up that
latency

702
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
latency
 

703
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,829
latency
across the four drives

704
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839

 

705
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,750

the latency is a big difference and then

706
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
the latency is a big difference and then
 

707
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,269
the latency is a big difference and then
the quality of service

708
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
the quality of service
 

709
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,269
the quality of service
so one of the things that we really

710
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
so one of the things that we really
 

711
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,790
so one of the things that we really
tested the data center the dc 500 and

712
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:55,800
tested the data center the dc 500 and
 

713
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,190
tested the data center the dc 500 and
450 and dc 1000 drives

714
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
450 and dc 1000 drives
 

715
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,829
450 and dc 1000 drives
they're they're tested extensively for

716
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
they're they're tested extensively for
 

717
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,110
they're they're tested extensively for
you know

718
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
you know
 

719
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,430
you know
quality of service that's the main the

720
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
quality of service that's the main the
 

721
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,030
quality of service that's the main the
main thing you're looking for if you're

722
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
main thing you're looking for if you're
 

723
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,389
main thing you're looking for if you're
putting them into a

724
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
putting them into a
 

725
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,550
putting them into a
data center like tier two cloud

726
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
data center like tier two cloud
 

727
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,750
data center like tier two cloud
something like that

728
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
something like that
 

729
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,069
something like that
uh you want a quality of service where

730
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
uh you want a quality of service where
 

731
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,710
uh you want a quality of service where
uh you know a consumer ssd might peak

732
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
uh you know a consumer ssd might peak
 

733
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,030
uh you know a consumer ssd might peak
and

734
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
and
 

735
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,110
and
deliver super performance for a short

736
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
deliver super performance for a short
 

737
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,230
deliver super performance for a short
period of time

738
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
period of time
 

739
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,990
period of time
and if you're only transferring a couple

740
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
and if you're only transferring a couple
 

741
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,750
and if you're only transferring a couple
gigs at a time that's what you want it's

742
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
gigs at a time that's what you want it's
 

743
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,710
gigs at a time that's what you want it's
on your laptop

744
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
on your laptop
 

745
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,670
on your laptop
right you know you're trying to get

746
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
right you know you're trying to get
 

747
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,190
right you know you're trying to get
things on and off really quick that's

748
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
things on and off really quick that's
 

749
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,910
things on and off really quick that's
awesome

750
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
awesome
 

751
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,949
awesome
but if you're if you're running a drive

752
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
but if you're if you're running a drive
 

753
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,750
but if you're if you're running a drive
you know 24 7 with a database with for

754
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
you know 24 7 with a database with for
 

755
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,509
you know 24 7 with a database with for
online transactions

756
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
online transactions
 

757
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,350
online transactions
uh you're writing to it and reading from

758
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
uh you're writing to it and reading from
 

759
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,590
uh you're writing to it and reading from
it like constantly

760
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
it like constantly
 

761
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,230
it like constantly
and you you don't want to see big spikes

762
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
and you you don't want to see big spikes
 

763
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,829
and you you don't want to see big spikes
up or down in the performance you want

764
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
up or down in the performance you want
 

765
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,470
up or down in the performance you want
to see

766
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
to see
 

767
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,110
to see
like a really flat line in that

768
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
like a really flat line in that
 

769
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,389
like a really flat line in that
performance and

770
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
performance and
 

771
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,069
performance and
and you'll see that with like a hard

772
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
and you'll see that with like a hard
 

773
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,629
and you'll see that with like a hard
drive you know uh it'll spike up really

774
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
drive you know uh it'll spike up really
 

775
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,310
drive you know uh it'll spike up really
fast initially because it's got a

776
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
fast initially because it's got a
 

777
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,470
fast initially because it's got a
dram cat anytime you're transferring a

778
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
dram cat anytime you're transferring a
 

779
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,990
dram cat anytime you're transferring a
video file or something it's like

780
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
video file or something it's like
 

781
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,069
video file or something it's like
fast and then and then it'll plummet

782
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
fast and then and then it'll plummet
 

783
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,069
fast and then and then it'll plummet
down to

784
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
down to
 

785
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,829
down to
right 200 megabytes per second and then

786
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
right 200 megabytes per second and then
 

787
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,509
right 200 megabytes per second and then
it goes 30 megabytes yes

788
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
it goes 30 megabytes yes
 

789
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,990
it goes 30 megabytes yes
and you're like what happened yeah uh

790
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
and you're like what happened yeah uh
 

791
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,269
and you're like what happened yeah uh
and the problem is

792
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
and the problem is
 

793
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,110
and the problem is
at a certain point you're running out of

794
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
at a certain point you're running out of
 

795
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,910
at a certain point you're running out of
cash or something like that so

796
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
cash or something like that so
 

797
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,030
cash or something like that so
in that uh you know in in your fio

798
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
in that uh you know in in your fio
 

799
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,910
in that uh you know in in your fio
script

800
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
script
 

801
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,910
script
uh one of the important things to do if

802
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
uh one of the important things to do if
 

803
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,430
uh one of the important things to do if
you're wanting to test for

804
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
you're wanting to test for
 

805
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,550
you're wanting to test for
data center use is to do that uh warm up

806
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
data center use is to do that uh warm up
 

807
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,949
data center use is to do that uh warm up
on the drive to have it burned in

808
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
on the drive to have it burned in
 

809
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,189
on the drive to have it burned in
so that uh it's not just like fresh out

810
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
so that uh it's not just like fresh out
 

811
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,790
so that uh it's not just like fresh out
of the box i just installed it and all

812
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
of the box i just installed it and all
 

813
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,310
of the box i just installed it and all
the sectors are blank and

814
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
the sectors are blank and
 

815
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,310
the sectors are blank and
and you know like uh because it's not

816
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
and you know like uh because it's not
 

817
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,110
and you know like uh because it's not
having to have any overhead of managing

818
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
having to have any overhead of managing
 

819
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,750
having to have any overhead of managing
uh data on the drive i would see what

820
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
uh data on the drive i would see what
 

821
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,150
uh data on the drive i would see what
the

822
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
the
 

823
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,110
the
drives in use so is that is that kind of

824
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
drives in use so is that is that kind of
 

825
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,790
drives in use so is that is that kind of
the key difference between the consumer

826
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
the key difference between the consumer
 

827
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,350
the key difference between the consumer
ssds that i have in my laptop in my home

828
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
ssds that i have in my laptop in my home
 

829
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,310
ssds that i have in my laptop in my home
computers

830
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
computers
 

831
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,509
computers
versus these data center drives yeah

832
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
versus these data center drives yeah
 

833
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,230
versus these data center drives yeah
that and you might see over provisioning

834
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
that and you might see over provisioning
 

835
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,269
that and you might see over provisioning
differences

836
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
differences
 

837
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,710
differences
um like our uh dc

838
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
um like our uh dc
 

839
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,710
um like our uh dc
uh drives um number one they have a

840
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
uh drives um number one they have a
 

841
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,069
uh drives um number one they have a
decent amount of uh

842
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
decent amount of uh
 

843
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,350
decent amount of uh
dram cash on them uh where a lot of

844
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
dram cash on them uh where a lot of
 

845
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,949
dram cash on them uh where a lot of
consumer drives might have

846
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
consumer drives might have
 

847
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,710
consumer drives might have
uh a pseudo slc where they take tlc or

848
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
uh a pseudo slc where they take tlc or
 

849
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,550
uh a pseudo slc where they take tlc or
qlc memory and program it

850
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
qlc memory and program it
 

851
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,430
qlc memory and program it
as slc so rather than you know they

852
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
as slc so rather than you know they
 

853
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,350
as slc so rather than you know they
might take a sector a section of the

854
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
might take a sector a section of the
 

855
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,069
might take a sector a section of the
drive and

856
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
drive and
 

857
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,990
drive and
and say this is going to be programmed

858
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
and say this is going to be programmed
 

859
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,550
and say this is going to be programmed
as slc so i'm only going to store

860
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
as slc so i'm only going to store
 

861
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,509
as slc so i'm only going to store
one bit of data in this cell instead of

862
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
one bit of data in this cell instead of
 

863
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,110
one bit of data in this cell instead of
the three or four like if it's

864
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
the three or four like if it's
 

865
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,990
the three or four like if it's
uh tlc you're storing three bits of data

866
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
uh tlc you're storing three bits of data
 

867
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,389
uh tlc you're storing three bits of data
and

868
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
and
 

869
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,509
and
uh or bytes and and uh

870
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
uh or bytes and and uh
 

871
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,550
uh or bytes and and uh
and qlc you're storing four so you've

872
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
and qlc you're storing four so you've
 

873
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,389
and qlc you're storing four so you've
got much more data that's being

874
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
got much more data that's being
 

875
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,189
got much more data that's being
stored there uh you know we had mlc uh

876
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
stored there uh you know we had mlc uh
 

877
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,790
stored there uh you know we had mlc uh
but then it was tlc and

878
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
but then it was tlc and
 

879
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,590
but then it was tlc and
uh qlc and you know we're we're trying

880
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
uh qlc and you know we're we're trying
 

881
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,389
uh qlc and you know we're we're trying
to plan

882
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
to plan
 

883
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,590
to plan
more more bits into uh uh

884
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
more more bits into uh uh
 

885
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,310
more more bits into uh uh
the more cells uh and as you do that it

886
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
the more cells uh and as you do that it
 

887
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,030
the more cells uh and as you do that it
gets

888
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
gets
 

889
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,030
gets
you know it takes a little longer to

890
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
you know it takes a little longer to
 

891
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,069
you know it takes a little longer to
program

892
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
program
 

893
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,269
program
uh all those uh bytes and bits into

894
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
uh all those uh bytes and bits into
 

895
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,310
uh all those uh bytes and bits into
uh the different cells so if you use the

896
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
uh the different cells so if you use the
 

897
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,150
uh the different cells so if you use the
pseudo cache of slc

898
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
pseudo cache of slc
 

899
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,990
pseudo cache of slc
which we do on a few drives as well and

900
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
which we do on a few drives as well and
 

901
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,670
which we do on a few drives as well and
consumer uh but

902
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
consumer uh but
 

903
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,629
consumer uh but
uh you're it the reason you do it is

904
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
uh you're it the reason you do it is
 

905
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,790
uh you're it the reason you do it is
it's much less expensive than using

906
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
it's much less expensive than using
 

907
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,710
it's much less expensive than using
dram and so uh on our on our data center

908
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
dram and so uh on our on our data center
 

909
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,189
dram and so uh on our on our data center
drives

910
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
drives
 

911
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,749
drives
there they all have like a nice big dram

912
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
there they all have like a nice big dram
 

913
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,189
there they all have like a nice big dram
cache on them that's one of the big

914
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
cache on them that's one of the big
 

915
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:23,829
cache on them that's one of the big
differences

916
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
differences
 

917
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,990
differences
oh okay and so uh that

918
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
oh okay and so uh that
 

919
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,550
oh okay and so uh that
that combined with uh the over

920
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
that combined with uh the over
 

921
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,590
that combined with uh the over
provisioning

922
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
provisioning
 

923
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,550
provisioning
that is on uh our data center drives

924
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
that is on uh our data center drives
 

925
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,990
that is on uh our data center drives
allows for

926
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
allows for
 

927
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,189
allows for
uh as well as tweaks in the firmware

928
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
uh as well as tweaks in the firmware
 

929
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,069
uh as well as tweaks in the firmware
it allows for really a high level of

930
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
it allows for really a high level of
 

931
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,590
it allows for really a high level of
quality of service so

932
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
quality of service so
 

933
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,990
quality of service so
you don't see big spikes way up and then

934
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
you don't see big spikes way up and then
 

935
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,790
you don't see big spikes way up and then
weight down and

936
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
weight down and
 

937
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,350
weight down and
and going you know right where you're at

938
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
and going you know right where you're at
 

939
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,790
and going you know right where you're at
the max performance of the bus

940
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
the max performance of the bus
 

941
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,350
the max performance of the bus
down to zero back to the middle and are

942
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
down to zero back to the middle and are
 

943
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,310
down to zero back to the middle and are
you when you say

944
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
you when you say
 

945
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,749
you when you say
when you say over provisioning are you

946
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
when you say over provisioning are you
 

947
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,990
when you say over provisioning are you
talking about io

948
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
talking about io
 

949
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,269
talking about io
now over provisioning is where if i have

950
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
now over provisioning is where if i have
 

951
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,710
now over provisioning is where if i have
like if you see uh an ssd that has

952
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
like if you see uh an ssd that has
 

953
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,990
like if you see uh an ssd that has
say it has 940 or 960 gigs

954
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
say it has 940 or 960 gigs
 

955
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,110
say it has 940 or 960 gigs
yeah uh of 960 gig capacities

956
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
yeah uh of 960 gig capacities
 

957
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,350
yeah uh of 960 gig capacities
really common right yeah that that's a

958
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
really common right yeah that that's a
 

959
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,510
really common right yeah that that's a
terabyte of nand that's on there

960
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
terabyte of nand that's on there
 

961
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,230
terabyte of nand that's on there
and it has over provisioning of uh three

962
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
and it has over provisioning of uh three
 

963
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,669
and it has over provisioning of uh three
to five percent

964
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
to five percent
 

965
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,390
to five percent
for the data itself so the storage yeah

966
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
for the data itself so the storage yeah
 

967
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,429
for the data itself so the storage yeah
okay and so when

968
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
okay and so when
 

969
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,029
okay and so when
when you see a drive that says one

970
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
when you see a drive that says one
 

971
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,630
when you see a drive that says one
terabyte

972
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
terabyte
 

973
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,789
terabyte
uh lots of times that's still the same

974
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
uh lots of times that's still the same
 

975
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,630
uh lots of times that's still the same
amount of nand as if you bought a

976
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
amount of nand as if you bought a
 

977
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,990
amount of nand as if you bought a
960 but the the thing you'll notice is

978
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
960 but the the thing you'll notice is
 

979
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,909
960 but the the thing you'll notice is
like on a consumer drive if you get up

980
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
like on a consumer drive if you get up
 

981
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,430
like on a consumer drive if you get up
to being

982
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
to being
 

983
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,150
to being

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,830
also start to tank
whereas if you have one that if you have

995
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,789
the you know the 960 gig
drive it can be 90 full and you'll still

996
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
drive it can be 90 full and you'll still
 

997
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,549
drive it can be 90 full and you'll still
be riding at the same speed

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,909
be riding at the same speed
as when it was empty uh you know

1000
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
as when it was empty uh you know
 

1001
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,029
as when it was empty uh you know
you it well i won't say when it was

1002
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
you it well i won't say when it was
 

1003
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,710
you it well i won't say when it was
empty because one of the things

1004
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
empty because one of the things
 

1005
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,590
empty because one of the things
we do that uh preconditioning right

1006
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
we do that uh preconditioning right
 

1007
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,710
we do that uh preconditioning right
that's part of our

1008
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
that's part of our
 

1009
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,070
that's part of our
script that we we're working on there

1010
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
script that we we're working on there
 

1011
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,870
script that we we're working on there
um that preconditioning basically make

1012
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
um that preconditioning basically make
 

1013
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,669
um that preconditioning basically make
sure that

1014
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
sure that
 

1015
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,789
sure that
the drives sort of dirtied up and and

1016
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
the drives sort of dirtied up and and
 

1017
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,270
the drives sort of dirtied up and and
uh is doing real workload type stuff so

1018
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
uh is doing real workload type stuff so
 

1019
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,909
uh is doing real workload type stuff so
you guys

1020
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
you guys
 

1021
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,510
you guys
because you can test anything out of the

1022
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
because you can test anything out of the
 

1023
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,990
because you can test anything out of the
box and it might look spectacular but

1024
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
box and it might look spectacular but
 

1025
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,070
box and it might look spectacular but
then when you put it into real use

1026
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
then when you put it into real use
 

1027
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,470
then when you put it into real use
uh throw it into a data center and you

1028
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
uh throw it into a data center and you
 

1029
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,470
uh throw it into a data center and you
know weak into being used

1030
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
know weak into being used
 

1031
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,150
know weak into being used
you're like this is not performing the

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
you're like this is not performing the
 

1033
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,750
you're like this is not performing the
way it did you know

1034
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
way it did you know
 

1035
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,270
way it did you know
i threw these consumer drives in there

1036
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
i threw these consumer drives in there
 

1037
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,950
i threw these consumer drives in there
and they were great and now they uh are

1038
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
and they were great and now they uh are
 

1039
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,830
and they were great and now they uh are
terrible

1040
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
terrible
 

1041
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,230
terrible
yeah um oh i see that yeah i've seen

1042
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
yeah um oh i see that yeah i've seen
 

1043
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,830
yeah um oh i see that yeah i've seen
that on desktop drives and

1044
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
that on desktop drives and
 

1045
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,750
that on desktop drives and
things like that yeah when they get

1046
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
things like that yeah when they get
 

1047
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,150
things like that yeah when they get
warmed up and dirty and make sense

1048
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
warmed up and dirty and make sense
 

1049
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,150
warmed up and dirty and make sense
they they're under real world working

1050
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
they they're under real world working
 

1051
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,510
they they're under real world working
conditions and not just

1052
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
conditions and not just
 

1053
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,029
conditions and not just
running a benchmark and now my iops

1054
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
running a benchmark and now my iops
 

1055
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,190
running a benchmark and now my iops
on the and you mentioned iops maybe i

1056
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
on the and you mentioned iops maybe i
 

1057
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,870
on the and you mentioned iops maybe i
could get you to briefly explain what

1058
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
could get you to briefly explain what
 

1059
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,150
could get you to briefly explain what
that means to us

1060
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
that means to us
 

1061
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,430
that means to us
um but it is through the roof

1062
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
um but it is through the roof
 

1063
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,029
um but it is through the roof
higher uh on the ssds what is that what

1064
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
higher uh on the ssds what is that what
 

1065
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,789
higher uh on the ssds what is that what
does that tell us

1066
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
does that tell us
 

1067
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,070
does that tell us
so uh part of that is it's because of

1068
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
so uh part of that is it's because of
 

1069
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,549
so uh part of that is it's because of
the

1070
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
the
 

1071
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,430
the
it's physics right so on the ssd

1072
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
it's physics right so on the ssd
 

1073
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,590
it's physics right so on the ssd
it's science we're talking about physics

1074
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
it's science we're talking about physics
 

1075
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,470
it's science we're talking about physics
because

1076
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
because
 

1077
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,510
because
the hard drive is actually relying

1078
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
the hard drive is actually relying
 

1079
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,070
the hard drive is actually relying
uh for the iops it actually has that

1080
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
uh for the iops it actually has that
 

1081
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,710
uh for the iops it actually has that
that

1082
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
that
 

1083
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,029
that
needle that moves back and forth with

1084
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
needle that moves back and forth with
 

1085
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,710
needle that moves back and forth with
the reader physical drives yeah

1086
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
the reader physical drives yeah
 

1087
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,750
the reader physical drives yeah
the the spinning drives and so it

1088
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
the the spinning drives and so it
 

1089
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,710
the the spinning drives and so it
actually has to

1090
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
actually has to
 

1091
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,270
actually has to
in order to read a point it has to

1092
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
in order to read a point it has to
 

1093
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,430
in order to read a point it has to
physically move to somewhere

1094
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
physically move to somewhere
 

1095
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,789
physically move to somewhere
find that read it uh verify it

1096
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
find that read it uh verify it
 

1097
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,630
find that read it uh verify it
and then move to the next point find it

1098
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
and then move to the next point find it
 

1099
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,390
and then move to the next point find it
read it and verify it so

1100
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
read it and verify it so
 

1101
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,669
read it and verify it so
uh just because of the way

1102
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
uh just because of the way
 

1103
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,909
uh just because of the way
physics and thermodynamics work the

1104
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
physics and thermodynamics work the
 

1105
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,029
physics and thermodynamics work the
drive can't spin

1106
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
drive can't spin
 

1107
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,190
drive can't spin
any faster they you know hard drives are

1108
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
any faster they you know hard drives are
 

1109
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,029
any faster they you know hard drives are
really really great for what they do

1110
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
really really great for what they do
 

1111
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,669
really really great for what they do
and that you get really big hard drives

1112
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
and that you get really big hard drives
 

1113
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,230
and that you get really big hard drives
and

1114
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
and
 

1115
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,909
and
they're pretty durable uh but

1116
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
they're pretty durable uh but
 

1117
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,909
they're pretty durable uh but
physics can't take them any farther

1118
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
physics can't take them any farther
 

1119
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,669
physics can't take them any farther
because and and so when you go

1120
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
because and and so when you go
 

1121
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,870
because and and so when you go
over to an ssd

1122
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
over to an ssd
 

1123
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,190
over to an ssd
uh you're just everything's uh

1124
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
uh you're just everything's uh
 

1125
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,990
uh you're just everything's uh
done through solid state you're not

1126
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
done through solid state you're not
 

1127
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,270
done through solid state you're not
moving anything

1128
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
moving anything
 

1129
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,630
moving anything
except electrons and so uh

1130
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
except electrons and so uh
 

1131
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,630
except electrons and so uh
you know you're you you have like your

1132
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
you know you're you you have like your
 

1133
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,630
you know you're you you have like your
seek times go down by a thousand

1134
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,640
seek times go down by a thousand
 

1135
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,669
seek times go down by a thousand
fold uh and that's why you'll see what

1136
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
fold uh and that's why you'll see what
 

1137
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,710
fold uh and that's why you'll see what
the iops difference um the

1138
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
the iops difference um the
 

1139
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,430
the iops difference um the
random read which was your best on the

1140
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
random read which was your best on the
 

1141
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,510
random read which was your best on the
hard drives random read of

1142
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:34,520
hard drives random read of
 

1143
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,710
hard drives random read of
673 iops

1144
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
673 iops
 

1145
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,909
673 iops
whereas the random read on the raid of

1146
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
whereas the random read on the raid of
 

1147
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,070
whereas the random read on the raid of
dc 500r was 121 000 iops

1148
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
dc 500r was 121 000 iops
 

1149
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,230
dc 500r was 121 000 iops
so 180 times the speed

1150
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
so 180 times the speed
 

1151
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,549
so 180 times the speed
yeah it's it's just a little faster a

1152
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
yeah it's it's just a little faster a
 

1153
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,630
yeah it's it's just a little faster a
little bit

1154
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,640
little bit
 

1155
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,110
little bit
that's amazing so now we understand now

1156
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
that's amazing so now we understand now
 

1157
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,750
that's amazing so now we understand now
that

1158
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
that
 

1159
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,430
that
so i've jumped from going from the

1160
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
so i've jumped from going from the
 

1161
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,950
so i've jumped from going from the
spinning drives to the

1162
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
spinning drives to the
 

1163
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,310
spinning drives to the
ssds now my bottleneck is sata

1164
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
ssds now my bottleneck is sata
 

1165
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,350
ssds now my bottleneck is sata
the the connection so

1166
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
the the connection so
 

1167
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,310
the the connection so
that 121 000 iops

1168
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
that 121 000 iops
 

1169
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,350
that 121 000 iops
with that if you went to

1170
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
with that if you went to
 

1171
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,549
with that if you went to
now you go to pcie based drives

1172
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
now you go to pcie based drives
 

1173
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,830
now you go to pcie based drives
pcie gen 3 nvme type drives

1174
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
pcie gen 3 nvme type drives
 

1175
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,190
pcie gen 3 nvme type drives
so either m.2 or u.2

1176
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
so either m.2 or u.2
 

1177
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,149
so either m.2 or u.2
u.2 is more friendly to a data center

1178
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
u.2 is more friendly to a data center
 

1179
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:30,870
u.2 is more friendly to a data center
because it

1180
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
because it
 

1181
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,390
because it
is in that two and a half inch form

1182
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
is in that two and a half inch form
 

1183
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,710
is in that two and a half inch form
factor rather than the gum stick form

1184
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
factor rather than the gum stick form
 

1185
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,750
factor rather than the gum stick form
factor which is

1186
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
factor which is
 

1187
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,270
factor which is
a little difficult to manage there's a

1188
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
a little difficult to manage there's a
 

1189
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,789
a little difficult to manage there's a
few people that have

1190
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
few people that have
 

1191
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,950
few people that have
uh adapters and things like that to put

1192
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
uh adapters and things like that to put
 

1193
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,430
uh adapters and things like that to put
lots of m.2s into servers but

1194
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
lots of m.2s into servers but
 

1195
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,310
lots of m.2s into servers but
um you know i think the the u.2 and the

1196
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
um you know i think the the u.2 and the
 

1197
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,390
um you know i think the the u.2 and the
ruler are going to be much more common

1198
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
ruler are going to be much more common
 

1199
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,870
ruler are going to be much more common
uh going forward for putting in lots of

1200
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
uh going forward for putting in lots of
 

1201
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,390
uh going forward for putting in lots of
you know like 24

1202
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
you know like 24
 

1203
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,909
you know like 24
or more uh u.2 drives uh

1204
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
or more uh u.2 drives uh
 

1205
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,190
or more uh u.2 drives uh
like nvme ssds into a server

1206
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
like nvme ssds into a server
 

1207
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,590
like nvme ssds into a server
uh but now you're talking like the iops

1208
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
uh but now you're talking like the iops
 

1209
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,630
uh but now you're talking like the iops
go up another

1210
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
go up another
 

1211
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,310
go up another
factor right um so like an nvme drive

1212
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
factor right um so like an nvme drive
 

1213
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,510
factor right um so like an nvme drive
because it's not limited

1214
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
because it's not limited
 

1215
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,029
because it's not limited
to uh by the sata bus uh

1216
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
to uh by the sata bus uh
 

1217
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,350
to uh by the sata bus uh
it uh is limited by the pcie bus so

1218
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
it uh is limited by the pcie bus so
 

1219
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,149
it uh is limited by the pcie bus so
um you know you go to gen four and

1220
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
um you know you go to gen four and
 

1221
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:18,630
um you know you go to gen four and
that's

1222
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
that's
 

1223
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,350
that's
twice as fast as gen three so you know

1224
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
twice as fast as gen three so you know
 

1225
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,430
twice as fast as gen three so you know
potentially twice as fast i

1226
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
potentially twice as fast i
 

1227
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,350
potentially twice as fast i
haven't seen any models where like it is

1228
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
haven't seen any models where like it is
 

1229
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,909
haven't seen any models where like it is
twice as fast but you know significantly

1230
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
twice as fast but you know significantly
 

1231
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,029
twice as fast but you know significantly
gen 4

1232
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
gen 4
 

1233
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,950
gen 4
demos that i've seen are significantly

1234
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
demos that i've seen are significantly
 

1235
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,830
demos that i've seen are significantly
faster like uh

1236
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
faster like uh
 

1237
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,990
faster like uh
you know you're talking off of by 16

1238
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
you know you're talking off of by 16
 

1239
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,990
you know you're talking off of by 16
uh i think uh the fastest demo i've seen

1240
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
uh i think uh the fastest demo i've seen
 

1241
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,270
uh i think uh the fastest demo i've seen
so far is about

1242
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
so far is about
 

1243
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,549
so far is about
25 gigabytes per second off of one

1244
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
25 gigabytes per second off of one
 

1245
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,430
25 gigabytes per second off of one
device

1246
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
device
 

1247
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,230
device
on one gen 4 bytes per second wow

1248
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
on one gen 4 bytes per second wow
 

1249
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,470
on one gen 4 bytes per second wow
and and i don't know how scalable that

1250
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
and and i don't know how scalable that
 

1251
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,590
and and i don't know how scalable that
is currently but

1252
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
is currently but
 

1253
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,070
is currently but
that was when gen 4 was still

1254
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
that was when gen 4 was still
 

1255
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,590
that was when gen 4 was still
experimental which it's a little

1256
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
experimental which it's a little
 

1257
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,870

1259
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,110

i think the amd one is is looking really

1260
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
i think the amd one is is looking really
 

1261
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,470
i think the amd one is is looking really
good but uh

1262
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
good but uh
 

1263
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,710
good but uh
i'll call it kind of experimental until

1264
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
i'll call it kind of experimental until
 

1265
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,510
i'll call it kind of experimental until
intel and amd both have their gen 4 out

1266
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
intel and amd both have their gen 4 out
 

1267
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,270
intel and amd both have their gen 4 out
and all of the enterprise servers are

1268
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
and all of the enterprise servers are
 

1269
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,390
and all of the enterprise servers are
shipping with gen 4 pcie because at this

1270
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
shipping with gen 4 pcie because at this
 

1271
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,789
shipping with gen 4 pcie because at this
point

1272
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799

high-end
a really high-end workstation you know

1278
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
a really high-end workstation you know
 

1279
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,590
a really high-end workstation you know
like it

1280
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,600
like it
 

1281
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,870
like it
uh nvidia's got a lot of cool demos with

1282
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
uh nvidia's got a lot of cool demos with
 

1283
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,470
uh nvidia's got a lot of cool demos with
four gpus on an amd proc with uh

1284
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
four gpus on an amd proc with uh
 

1285
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,669
four gpus on an amd proc with uh
you know lots of nvme uh uh

1286
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
you know lots of nvme uh uh
 

1287
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,909
you know lots of nvme uh uh
drives connected to it and they're doing

1288
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
drives connected to it and they're doing
 

1289
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,310
drives connected to it and they're doing
some really neat demos and as is amd

1290
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
some really neat demos and as is amd
 

1291
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,110
some really neat demos and as is amd
with their

1292
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
with their
 

1293
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,149
with their
their gpus but

1294
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
their gpus but
 

1295
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,750
their gpus but
all that right now seems it it's like

1296
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
all that right now seems it it's like
 

1297
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,789
all that right now seems it it's like
if i have to go drop five to

1298
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
if i have to go drop five to
 

1299
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,990
if i have to go drop five to
20 grand on a workstation um i i'm gonna

1300
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
20 grand on a workstation um i i'm gonna
 

1301
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,390
20 grand on a workstation um i i'm gonna
wait

1302
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
wait
 

1303
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,510
wait
until it's uh somebody else uh

1304
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
until it's uh somebody else uh
 

1305
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,950
until it's uh somebody else uh
works out all the wrinkles in that

1306
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
works out all the wrinkles in that
 

1307
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,630
works out all the wrinkles in that
experiment so

1308
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
experiment so
 

1309
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,630
experiment so
thinking about my use case so i

1310
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
thinking about my use case so i
 

1311
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,390
thinking about my use case so i
obviously work here in a studio so i'm

1312
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
obviously work here in a studio so i'm
 

1313
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,390
obviously work here in a studio so i'm
doing a lot of video production

1314
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
doing a lot of video production
 

1315
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,070
doing a lot of video production
maybe some of our viewers are working in

1316
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
maybe some of our viewers are working in
 

1317
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,669
maybe some of our viewers are working in
an office environment where they've got

1318
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
an office environment where they've got
 

1319
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,110
an office environment where they've got
similar scenarios where

1320
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
similar scenarios where
 

1321
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,630
similar scenarios where
hey we've got to replace the drives in

1322
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
hey we've got to replace the drives in
 

1323
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,549
hey we've got to replace the drives in
an older server or maybe it's not even

1324
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
an older server or maybe it's not even
 

1325
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,870
an older server or maybe it's not even
that old but

1326
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
that old but
 

1327
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,070
that old but
they're they're not necessarily

1328
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
they're they're not necessarily
 

1329
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,510
they're they're not necessarily
replacing an entire server they just

1330
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520
replacing an entire server they just
 

1331
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,149
replacing an entire server they just
want to put

1332
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
want to put
 

1333
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,950
want to put
ssds in instead of the spinning drives

1334
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
ssds in instead of the spinning drives
 

1335
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,669
ssds in instead of the spinning drives
because they're

1336
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
because they're
 

1337
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,350
because they're
kind of the way to go right now and

1338
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
kind of the way to go right now and
 

1339
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,110
kind of the way to go right now and
we're certainly seeing a big performance

1340
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
we're certainly seeing a big performance
 

1341
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,070
we're certainly seeing a big performance
boost here

1342
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
boost here
 

1343
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,669
boost here
um is there you know where where is the

1344
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
um is there you know where where is the
 

1345
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,430
um is there you know where where is the
performance gain so for me it's

1346
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
performance gain so for me it's
 

1347
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,710
performance gain so for me it's
it's in editing real-time 4k video it's

1348
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:34,720
it's in editing real-time 4k video it's
 

1349
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,750
it's in editing real-time 4k video it's
it's brilliant on the on the dc 500rs

1350
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
it's brilliant on the on the dc 500rs
 

1351
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,789
it's brilliant on the on the dc 500rs
um where where is the the average

1352
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
um where where is the the average
 

1353
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,789
um where where is the the average
business consumer

1354
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
business consumer
 

1355
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,070

tech support for
 

1369
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,870
tech support for
people in those communities and and you

1370
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
people in those communities and and you
 

1371
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,310
people in those communities and and you
know like uh

1372
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
know like uh
 

1373
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,950
know like uh
uh doctors and lawyers are notoriously

1374
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
uh doctors and lawyers are notoriously
 

1375
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,190
uh doctors and lawyers are notoriously
cheap when it comes to you know like uh

1376
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
cheap when it comes to you know like uh
 

1377
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,269
cheap when it comes to you know like uh
spending money on on systems like that

1378
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
spending money on on systems like that
 

1379
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,070
spending money on on systems like that
but the systems also drive all of the

1380
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
but the systems also drive all of the
 

1381
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,029
but the systems also drive all of the
uh all of the uh revenue in their

1382
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
uh all of the uh revenue in their
 

1383
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,390
uh all of the uh revenue in their
business so it's really important for

1384
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
business so it's really important for
 

1385
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,070
business so it's really important for
them to keep them updated

1386
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,080
them to keep them updated
 

1387
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,110
them to keep them updated
and i think the thing that you

1388
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
and i think the thing that you
 

1389
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,950
and i think the thing that you
get by going from hard drive to ssds

1390
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
get by going from hard drive to ssds
 

1391
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,870
get by going from hard drive to ssds
on an upgrade of an older system you

1392
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
on an upgrade of an older system you
 

1393
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,549
on an upgrade of an older system you
know you'll be able to ring

1394
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
know you'll be able to ring
 

1395
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,510
know you'll be able to ring
at least two or three more years out of

1396
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
at least two or three more years out of
 

1397
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,950
at least two or three more years out of
it if not more

1398
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
it if not more
 

1399
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,430
it if not more
um you know you'll you you'll you always

1400
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440
um you know you'll you you'll you always
 

1401
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,950
um you know you'll you you'll you always
hit a bottleneck somewhere but

1402
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
hit a bottleneck somewhere but
 

1403
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,230
hit a bottleneck somewhere but
rather than your system being the

1404
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
rather than your system being the
 

1405
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,070
rather than your system being the
bottleneck it might be the os or the

1406
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
bottleneck it might be the os or the
 

1407
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,269
bottleneck it might be the os or the
version of the software

1408
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:43,279
version of the software
 

1409
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,430
version of the software
that you're using or something like that

1410
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
that you're using or something like that
 

1411
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,630
that you're using or something like that
but uh

1412
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
but uh
 

1413
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,029
but uh
you'll make something much more usable

1414
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:49,039
you'll make something much more usable
 

1415
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,669
you'll make something much more usable
have you ever taken an old hard drive ss

1416
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
have you ever taken an old hard drive ss
 

1417
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,230
have you ever taken an old hard drive ss
or a whole old hard drive laptop and put

1418
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
or a whole old hard drive laptop and put
 

1419
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,590
or a whole old hard drive laptop and put
an ssd in it and

1420
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
an ssd in it and
 

1421
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,110
an ssd in it and
you know it's like all sudden it's like

1422
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
you know it's like all sudden it's like
 

1423
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,630
you know it's like all sudden it's like
why was i going to get rid of this thing

1424
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
why was i going to get rid of this thing
 

1425
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,510
why was i going to get rid of this thing
it's so fast

1426
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
it's so fast
 

1427
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,350
it's so fast
exactly it like breathes new life into

1428
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
exactly it like breathes new life into
 

1429
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,430
exactly it like breathes new life into
an old system and that's exactly what

1430
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
an old system and that's exactly what
 

1431
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,230
an old system and that's exactly what
this has done

1432
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
this has done
 

1433
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,070
this has done
for our server and i and as you're

1434
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,080
for our server and i and as you're
 

1435
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,350
for our server and i and as you're
talking about bottlenecks i'm thinking

1436
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
talking about bottlenecks i'm thinking
 

1437
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,750
talking about bottlenecks i'm thinking
okay well sata is six gig a second

1438
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
okay well sata is six gig a second
 

1439
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,590
okay well sata is six gig a second
so i think my bottleneck actually mark

1440
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
so i think my bottleneck actually mark
 

1441
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,190
so i think my bottleneck actually mark
is going to be my networking because i'm

1442
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
is going to be my networking because i'm
 

1443
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,310
is going to be my networking because i'm
only on gig

1444
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
only on gig
 

1445
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,110
only on gig
ethernet so yeah that's my bottleneck

1446
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
ethernet so yeah that's my bottleneck
 

1447
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,070
ethernet so yeah that's my bottleneck
but

1448
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
but
 

1449
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,029
but
being a very small business myself

1450
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
being a very small business myself
 

1451
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,310
being a very small business myself
having gig

1452
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
having gig
 

1453
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,029
having gig
ethernet and being able to edit video

1454
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
ethernet and being able to edit video
 

1455
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,590
ethernet and being able to edit video
over

1456
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
over
 

1457
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,070
over
one gig a second is is stellar it's

1458
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
one gig a second is is stellar it's
 

1459
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,190
one gig a second is is stellar it's
superb

1460
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
superb
 

1461
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,990
superb
um well the the trick you know for that

1462
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
um well the the trick you know for that
 

1463
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,070
um well the the trick you know for that
like because my job was breaking those

1464
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
like because my job was breaking those
 

1465
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,110
like because my job was breaking those
kind of bottlenecks

1466
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
kind of bottlenecks
 

1467
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,549
kind of bottlenecks
uh previously is i would put a 10 gig

1468
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
uh previously is i would put a 10 gig
 

1469
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,590
uh previously is i would put a 10 gig
uh on your server and have a switch that

1470
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
uh on your server and have a switch that
 

1471
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,190
uh on your server and have a switch that
distributes it out to

1472
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
distributes it out to
 

1473
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,870
distributes it out to
your gigabit clients and and until you

1474
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
your gigabit clients and and until you
 

1475
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,149
your gigabit clients and and until you
get a 10 gig uh or desktop or something

1476
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
get a 10 gig uh or desktop or something
 

1477
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:50,630
get a 10 gig uh or desktop or something
but

1478
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
but
 

1479
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,870
but
you could always go you know like uh do

1480
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
you could always go you know like uh do
 

1481
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,870
you could always go you know like uh do
it gradually just like adding

1482
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
it gradually just like adding
 

1483
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,430
it gradually just like adding
uh ssds to your uh uh legacy systems

1484
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,440
uh ssds to your uh uh legacy systems
 

1485
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,750
uh ssds to your uh uh legacy systems
yeah uh that's a good idea just kind of

1486
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
yeah uh that's a good idea just kind of
 

1487
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,269
yeah uh that's a good idea just kind of
upgrade the the networking

1488
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
upgrade the the networking
 

1489
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,230
upgrade the the networking
as i go that's the next step yeah um

1490
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,240
as i go that's the next step yeah um
 

1491
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,750
as i go that's the next step yeah um
what kind of longevity am i going to be

1492
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
what kind of longevity am i going to be
 

1493
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,870
what kind of longevity am i going to be
looking at um

1494
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
looking at um
 

1495
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,510
looking at um
for ssds i know like when ssds first

1496
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
for ssds i know like when ssds first
 

1497
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,230
for ssds i know like when ssds first
came out so

1498
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
came out so
 

1499
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,590
came out so
years ago um there were those of us who

1500
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
years ago um there were those of us who
 

1501
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,230
years ago um there were those of us who
were hesitant and afraid to switch to

1502
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
were hesitant and afraid to switch to
 

1503
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,190
were hesitant and afraid to switch to
ssd

1504
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
ssd
 

1505
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,029
ssd
because the they weren't quite as

1506
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
because the they weren't quite as
 

1507
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,750
because the they weren't quite as
reliable but that has completely changed

1508
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
reliable but that has completely changed
 

1509
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,789
reliable but that has completely changed
over the past several years are we like

1510
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:26,799
over the past several years are we like
 

1511
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,269
over the past several years are we like
what kind of lifespan do we expect from

1512
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
what kind of lifespan do we expect from
 

1513
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,470
what kind of lifespan do we expect from
like your your data center drives uh

1514
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
like your your data center drives uh
 

1515
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,630
like your your data center drives uh
so our data center drives we warrant

1516
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,640
so our data center drives we warrant
 

1517
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,149
so our data center drives we warrant
them for five years

1518
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
them for five years
 

1519
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,110
them for five years
uh yeah and then you know like the they

1520
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
uh yeah and then you know like the they
 

1521
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,909
uh yeah and then you know like the they
have different

1522
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
have different
 

1523
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,669
have different
um drive rights per day

1524
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
um drive rights per day
 

1525
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,350
um drive rights per day
warranties as well so like the dc 500

1526
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
warranties as well so like the dc 500
 

1527
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,389
warranties as well so like the dc 500
that's a 0.3 drive right per day so if

1528
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:50,399
that's a 0.3 drive right per day so if
 

1529
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,029
that's a 0.3 drive right per day so if
you have a

1530
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
you have a
 

1531
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,230
you have a
four terabyte or a three three point uh

1532
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
four terabyte or a three three point uh
 

1533
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,750
four terabyte or a three three point uh
was it 3.86 uh

1534
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
was it 3.86 uh
 

1535
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,350
was it 3.86 uh
if you have a four essentially there's

1536
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
if you have a four essentially there's
 

1537
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,870
if you have a four essentially there's
four terabytes in the end on there

1538
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
four terabytes in the end on there
 

1539
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,710
four terabytes in the end on there
but if you have like a four terabyte

1540
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
but if you have like a four terabyte
 

1541
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,549
but if you have like a four terabyte
drive or an eight terabyte drive

1542
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:04,559
drive or an eight terabyte drive
 

1543
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,350
drive or an eight terabyte drive
of the r which is a read centric model

1544
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
of the r which is a read centric model
 

1545
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,310
of the r which is a read centric model
you can get

1546
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
you can get
 

1547
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,149
you can get
uh up to uh you can do uh 0.3 drive

1548
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
uh up to uh you can do uh 0.3 drive
 

1549
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,669
uh up to uh you can do uh 0.3 drive

rights per day
 

1551
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,710
rights per day
um uh the m

1552
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
um uh the m
 

1553
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,310
um uh the m
version of that is 1.5 drive rights per

1554
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
version of that is 1.5 drive rights per
 

1555
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,950
version of that is 1.5 drive rights per
day

1556
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:20,960
day
 

1557
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,789
day
and if you think about that for a four

1558
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
and if you think about that for a four
 

1559
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,070
and if you think about that for a four
terabyte drive

1560
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
terabyte drive
 

1561
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,310
terabyte drive
that's a lot of writing yeah if you're

1562
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
that's a lot of writing yeah if you're
 

1563
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,430
that's a lot of writing yeah if you're
riding uh

1564
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440
riding uh
 

1565
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,950
riding uh
you know like uh six terabytes a day uh

1566
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
you know like uh six terabytes a day uh
 

1567
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,870
you know like uh six terabytes a day uh
you might be running facebook off of

1568
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
you might be running facebook off of
 

1569
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,110
you might be running facebook off of
your uh server i don't know

1570
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
your uh server i don't know
 

1571
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,669
your uh server i don't know
that's a lot of data to fill up and

1572
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
that's a lot of data to fill up and
 

1573
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,389
that's a lot of data to fill up and
delete

1574
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
delete
 

1575
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,389
delete
because that's it's not so much about um

1576
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
because that's it's not so much about um
 

1577
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,669
because that's it's not so much about um
you know like if you're just collecting

1578
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679
you know like if you're just collecting
 

1579
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,750
you know like if you're just collecting
drives or collecting data on your drives

1580
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
drives or collecting data on your drives
 

1581
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,350
drives or collecting data on your drives
that's what the r is all about

1582
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
that's what the r is all about
 

1583
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,230
that's what the r is all about
right so the read centric one if i want

1584
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
right so the read centric one if i want
 

1585
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,470
right so the read centric one if i want
to

1586
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
to
 

1587
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,190
to
like have a database full of video and

1588
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
like have a database full of video and
 

1589
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,909
like have a database full of video and
images

1590
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
images
 

1591
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,029
images
and text files and spreadsheets and

00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:57,039
and text files and spreadsheets and
 

1593
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,990
and text files and spreadsheets and
stuff that's going to live there forever

1594
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
stuff that's going to live there forever
 

1595
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,310
stuff that's going to live there forever
the

1596
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,320
the
 

1597
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,029
the
the dc 500r is a really great drive

1598
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
the dc 500r is a really great drive
 

1599
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,630
the dc 500r is a really great drive
because i'm just adding stuff to it all

1600
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
because i'm just adding stuff to it all
 

1601
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,669
because i'm just adding stuff to it all
the time i'm not

1602
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
the time i'm not
 

1603
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,510
the time i'm not
adding you know like a terabyte at a

1604
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,520
adding you know like a terabyte at a
 

1605
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,830
adding you know like a terabyte at a
time and then calculating that data and

1606
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,840
time and then calculating that data and
 

1607
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,269
time and then calculating that data and
deleting the whole thing and

1608
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
deleting the whole thing and
 

1609
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,110
deleting the whole thing and
and putting in the answer that's another

1610
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
and putting in the answer that's another
 

1611
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,789
and putting in the answer that's another
terabyte um

1612
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
terabyte um
 

1613
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,110
terabyte um
you know that that's something like uh

1614
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
you know that that's something like uh
 

1615
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,870
you know that that's something like uh
uh lamp where you've got

1616
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:18,880
uh lamp where you've got
 

1617
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,909
uh lamp where you've got
you know apache server and and or an

1624
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,520
transaction thing where you know
 

1625
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,070
transaction thing where you know
uh uh you're you're just grinding

1626
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
uh uh you're you're just grinding
 

1627
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,669
uh uh you're you're just grinding
through the data like you know

1628
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
through the data like you know
 

1629
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,750
through the data like you know
facebook where you're just adding new

1630
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
facebook where you're just adding new
 

1631
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,110
facebook where you're just adding new
cat videos all the time and then

1632
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
cat videos all the time and then
 

1633
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,789
cat videos all the time and then
deleting them as they get old

1634
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
deleting them as they get old
 

1635
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,990
deleting them as they get old
right um you know uh most people

1636
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
right um you know uh most people
 

1637
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,350
right um you know uh most people
don't do that like i i've got a a drobo

1638
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
don't do that like i i've got a a drobo
 

1639
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,669
don't do that like i i've got a a drobo
uh server that i just add stuff to

1640
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
uh server that i just add stuff to
 

1641
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,389
uh server that i just add stuff to
constantly

1642
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
constantly
 

1643
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,750
constantly
so uh i actually had to unplug it

1644
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
so uh i actually had to unplug it
 

1645
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,430
so uh i actually had to unplug it
because it's so loud because of all the

1646
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440
because it's so loud because of all the
 

1647
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,430
because it's so loud because of all the
hard drives i'm gonna put uh

1648
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
hard drives i'm gonna put uh
 

1649
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,909
hard drives i'm gonna put uh
four four terabyte ssds in there perfect

1650
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
four four terabyte ssds in there perfect
 

1651
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,070
four four terabyte ssds in there perfect
that'll make it quiet yeah yeah

1652
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
that'll make it quiet yeah yeah
 

1653
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,830
that'll make it quiet yeah yeah
it's pretty quiet all of a sudden it's

1654
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
it's pretty quiet all of a sudden it's
 

1655
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,190
it's pretty quiet all of a sudden it's
interesting you say that like

1656
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
interesting you say that like
 

1657
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,549
interesting you say that like
because that's the other thing that we

1658
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
because that's the other thing that we
 

1659
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,990
because that's the other thing that we
don't necessarily think about with the

1660
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
don't necessarily think about with the
 

1661
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,029
don't necessarily think about with the
upgrade is this

1662
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
upgrade is this
 

1663
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,750
upgrade is this
the silence of them the energy

1664
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
the silence of them the energy
 

1665
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,269
the silence of them the energy
efficiency yeah

1666
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
efficiency yeah
 

1667
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,350
efficiency yeah
i i have to say that ssds uh

1668
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
i i have to say that ssds uh
 

1669
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,230
i i have to say that ssds uh
compared to hard drive energy efficiency

1670
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
compared to hard drive energy efficiency
 

1671
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,310
compared to hard drive energy efficiency
hard drives are actually really good at

1672
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
hard drives are actually really good at
 

1673
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,510
hard drives are actually really good at
when they're not being used

1674
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
when they're not being used
 

1675
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,549
when they're not being used
shutting down like they've they've

1676
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
shutting down like they've they've
 

1677
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,070
shutting down like they've they've
really gotten good at being energy

1678
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,080
really gotten good at being energy
 

1679
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,389
really gotten good at being energy
efficient uh and and

1680
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
efficient uh and and
 

1681
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,870
efficient uh and and
i don't think that anybody's replacing

1682
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
i don't think that anybody's replacing
 

1683
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,909
i don't think that anybody's replacing
hard drives

1684
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:29,919
hard drives
 

1685
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,110
hard drives
with like well they have that that's

1686
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
with like well they have that that's
 

1687
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,870
with like well they have that that's
exactly what we are exactly

1688
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
exactly what we are exactly
 

1689
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,870
exactly what we are exactly
replacing hard drugs but they have their

1690
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
replacing hard drugs but they have their
 

1691
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,350
replacing hard drugs but they have their
places like if i want to store

1692
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
places like if i want to store
 

1693
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,269
places like if i want to store
40 uh terabytes of data that's just cold

1694
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
40 uh terabytes of data that's just cold
 

1695

data
 

1697
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,430
data
that i'm not going to access all the

1698
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:45,440
that i'm not going to access all the
 

1699
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,870
that i'm not going to access all the
time but i really i need for legal

1700
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:46,880
time but i really i need for legal
 

1701
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,830

reasons or

1702
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
reasons or
 

1703
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,990
reasons or
you know like to make me feel secure or

1704
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
you know like to make me feel secure or
 

1705
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,750
you know like to make me feel secure or
it's my backup

1706
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
it's my backup
 

1707
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,830
it's my backup
that's a perfect use for hard drives if

1708
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
that's a perfect use for hard drives if
 

1709
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,110
that's a perfect use for hard drives if
you have data that you want to be able

1710
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
you have data that you want to be able
 

1711
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,950
you have data that you want to be able
to read and work off of

1712
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
to read and work off of
 

1713
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,549
to read and work off of
hard drives are terrible for that just

1714
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
hard drives are terrible for that just
 

1715
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,990
hard drives are terrible for that just
because the latency and you know it's

1716
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
because the latency and you know it's
 

1717
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,389
because the latency and you know it's
like

1718
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
like
 

1719
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,830
like
if you're one user and you are getting

1720
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
if you're one user and you are getting
 

1721
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,190
if you're one user and you are getting
the data off the hard drives

1722
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
the data off the hard drives
 

1723
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,549
the data off the hard drives
it's bad enough to have to wait for it

1724
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
it's bad enough to have to wait for it
 

1725
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,310
it's bad enough to have to wait for it
but if you've got like 10 users

1726
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
but if you've got like 10 users
 

1727
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,029
but if you've got like 10 users
or even you know three or four users

1728
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
or even you know three or four users
 

1729
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,149
or even you know three or four users
that are all hitting that

1730
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
that are all hitting that
 

1731
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,269
that are all hitting that

uh hard drive array at the same time
 

1733
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,190
uh hard drive array at the same time
you can start you know like hey you know

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
you can start you know like hey you know
 

1735
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,350
you can start you know like hey you know
like why why is everything slowing down

1736
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
like why why is everything slowing down
 

1737
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,909
like why why is everything slowing down
so much

1738
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
so much
 

1739
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,669
so much
it's like um you know you'll also see a

1740
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
it's like um you know you'll also see a
 

1741
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,630
it's like um you know you'll also see a
lot better

1742
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
lot better
 

1743
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,990

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,950
of spin-up
uh a virtual machine yeah when you

1778
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:02,960
uh a virtual machine yeah when you
 

1779
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,990
uh a virtual machine yeah when you
are coming off of uh sata drive there's

1780
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
are coming off of uh sata drive there's
 

1781
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,990
are coming off of uh sata drive there's
still a little spin up time but it

1782
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
still a little spin up time but it
 

1783
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,269
still a little spin up time but it
it's like a fraction of uh what the spin

1784
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
it's like a fraction of uh what the spin
 

1785
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:11,830
it's like a fraction of uh what the spin
up time

1786
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
up time
 

1787
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,590
up time
because it really is a spin up time off

1788
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
because it really is a spin up time off
 

1789
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,870
because it really is a spin up time off
of hard drives

1790
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
of hard drives
 

1791
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,269
of hard drives
uh and then if you go to nvme it's it's

1792
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:17,279
uh and then if you go to nvme it's it's
 

1793
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,269
uh and then if you go to nvme it's it's
almost like it was in dram you know it's

1794
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
almost like it was in dram you know it's
 

1795
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,029
almost like it was in dram you know it's
like because the nvme drives

1796
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:21,039
like because the nvme drives
 

1797
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,549
like because the nvme drives
being the you know it's off the sata bus

1798
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
being the you know it's off the sata bus
 

1799
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,669
being the you know it's off the sata bus
and onto the pcie bus it's one step

1800
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:27,679
and onto the pcie bus it's one step
 

1801
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,710
and onto the pcie bus it's one step
closer to the processor mm-hmm and

1802
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
closer to the processor mm-hmm and
 

1803
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,630
closer to the processor mm-hmm and
we can that's why like dram is the best

1804
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
we can that's why like dram is the best
 

1805
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,630
we can that's why like dram is the best
because it's on the processor right

1806
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
because it's on the processor right
 

1807
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,509
because it's on the processor right
sure even the you know i guess the cache

1808
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
sure even the you know i guess the cache
 

1809
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,710
sure even the you know i guess the cache
and the processor

1810
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
and the processor
 

1811
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,190
and the processor
is on the processor but it's also not

1812
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
is on the processor but it's also not
 

1813
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,149
is on the processor but it's also not
connected to your

1814
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
connected to your
 

1815
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,909
connected to your
uh display and and all that so

1816
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
uh display and and all that so
 

1817
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,230
uh display and and all that so
dram is sort of the king and which we

1818
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
dram is sort of the king and which we
 

1819
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,110
dram is sort of the king and which we
also make

1820
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,120
also make
 

1821
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,389
also make
there's all these um kind of irrelevant

1822
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:52,399
there's all these um kind of irrelevant
 

1823
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,909
there's all these um kind of irrelevant
almost benchmarks of

1824
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:53,919
almost benchmarks of
 

1825
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,190
almost benchmarks of
people turning on their computer and how

1826
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,200
people turning on their computer and how
 

1827
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,269
people turning on their computer and how
long does it take to boot and it's

1828
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
long does it take to boot and it's
 

1829
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,909
long does it take to boot and it's
and it's it's kind of irrelevant in so

1830
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
and it's it's kind of irrelevant in so
 

1831
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,350
and it's it's kind of irrelevant in so
many ways and it makes me think about

1832
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,360
many ways and it makes me think about
 

1833
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,149
many ways and it makes me think about
those spinning

1834
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
those spinning
 

1835
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,549
those spinning
those drives spinning up we have such a

1836
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
those drives spinning up we have such a
 

1837
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,909
those drives spinning up we have such a
uh

1838
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
uh
 

1839
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,950
uh
we have a tendency to look at okay when

1840
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:08,960
we have a tendency to look at okay when
 

1841
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,070
we have a tendency to look at okay when
i click on something how

1842
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
i click on something how
 

1843
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,630
i click on something how
quickly does it happen how quickly does

1844
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
quickly does it happen how quickly does
 

1845
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,230
quickly does it happen how quickly does
that application come up

1846
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
that application come up
 

1847
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,470
that application come up
and for me in this scenario how quickly

1848
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
and for me in this scenario how quickly
 

1849
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,990
and for me in this scenario how quickly
am i able to open

1850
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
am i able to open
 

1851
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,190
am i able to open
large video files in my editor and right

1852
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
large video files in my editor and right
 

1853
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,669
large video files in my editor and right
that's like where yeah i'm not having to

1854
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:23,679
that's like where yeah i'm not having to
 

1855
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,470
that's like where yeah i'm not having to
wait for

1856
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
wait for
 

1857
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,870
wait for
for that that moment is just an instant

1858
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
for that that moment is just an instant
 

1859
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,549
for that that moment is just an instant
moment for me

1860
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
moment for me
 

1861
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,669
moment for me
i would do uh so i a lot of the i would

1862
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:31,679
i would do uh so i a lot of the i would
 

1863
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,669
i would do uh so i a lot of the i would
create demos for when we go to trade

1864
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:33,679
create demos for when we go to trade
 

1865
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,630
create demos for when we go to trade
shows like nib

1866
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
shows like nib
 

1867
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,470
shows like nib
the broadcasters uh north american

1868
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:36,480
the broadcasters uh north american
 

1869
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,870
the broadcasters uh north american
broadcaster show or ibc

1870
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
broadcaster show or ibc
 

1871
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,830
broadcaster show or ibc
in amsterdam uh i'd create some demos

1872
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
in amsterdam uh i'd create some demos
 

1873
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,190
in amsterdam uh i'd create some demos
with adobe

1874
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
with adobe
 

1875
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,909
with adobe
and uh you know one of the things that

1876
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:45,919
and uh you know one of the things that
 

1877
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,750
and uh you know one of the things that
we'd have to do there is like if we're

1878
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
we'd have to do there is like if we're
 

1879
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,350
we'd have to do there is like if we're
editing 8k or you know 4k or 8k video

1880
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
editing 8k or you know 4k or 8k video
 

1881
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,029
editing 8k or you know 4k or 8k video
you have to make sure that the clips are

1882
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
you have to make sure that the clips are
 

1883
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,430
you have to make sure that the clips are
long enough to blow out any

1884
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,440
long enough to blow out any
 

1885
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,669
long enough to blow out any
dram that you have you know because if

1886
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
dram that you have you know because if
 

1887
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,509
dram that you have you know because if
you know like if i'm editing and it's

1888
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
you know like if i'm editing and it's
 

1889
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,110
you know like if i'm editing and it's
really small files they could all just

1890
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
really small files they could all just
 

1891
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,230
really small files they could all just
live in dram

1892
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
live in dram
 

1893
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,230
live in dram
or you know and i wouldn't know the

1894
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,240
or you know and i wouldn't know the
 

1895
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,509
or you know and i wouldn't know the
difference you know it's like it could

1896
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:07,519
difference you know it's like it could
 

1897
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:07,909
difference you know it's like it could
be

1898
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
be
 

1899
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,270
be
coming off a hard drive but the first

1900
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
coming off a hard drive but the first
 

1901
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,030
coming off a hard drive but the first
time i read it it's really slow but

1902
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
time i read it it's really slow but
 

1903
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,829
time i read it it's really slow but
after that it's

1904
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
after that it's
 

1905
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,149
after that it's
nice and fast uh because the if the

1906
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:14,159
nice and fast uh because the if the
 

1907
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,430
nice and fast uh because the if the
files are tiny

1908
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
files are tiny
 

1909
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,790
files are tiny
but if you are trying to pull like 4k

1910
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
but if you are trying to pull like 4k
 

1911
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,430
but if you are trying to pull like 4k
still frames rather than an avi or a

uh you know that because the avr
 

1917
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,750
uh you know that because the avr
quicktime might be able to

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
quicktime might be able to
 

1919
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,270
quicktime might be able to
be stored in if you have 64 or 128 gigs

1920
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
be stored in if you have 64 or 128 gigs

most of the video there
 

1927
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,310
most of the video there
but you don't really see the performance

1928
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
but you don't really see the performance
 

1929
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,550
but you don't really see the performance
of the ssds until you

1930
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560
of the ssds until you
 

1931
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,389
of the ssds until you
have something that sort of outmatches

1932
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
have something that sort of outmatches
 

1933
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,310
have something that sort of outmatches
