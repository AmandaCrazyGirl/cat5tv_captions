uh micro sd card uh reader writer it's
 

81
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,270
uh micro sd card uh reader writer it's
pretty slow

82

pretty slow
 

83
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,030

it should get rid of that bottleneck

86
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
it should get rid of that bottleneck
 

87
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,950
it should get rid of that bottleneck
absolutely so that's going to be the

88
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
absolutely so that's going to be the
 

89
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,870
absolutely so that's going to be the
an interesting test and i mean this was

90
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
an interesting test and i mean this was
 

91
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,270
an interesting test and i mean this was
done on a raspberry pi 4 with 4 giga ram

92
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
done on a raspberry pi 4 with 4 giga ram
 

93
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,670
done on a raspberry pi 4 with 4 giga ram
yeah

94
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
yeah
 

95
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,950
yeah
i i can only imagine how much better it

96
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
i i can only imagine how much better it
 

97
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,630
i i can only imagine how much better it
would be on an 8 gig ram

98
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
would be on an 8 gig ram
 

99
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,270
would be on an 8 gig ram
because possible yeah i mean we i don't

100
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
because possible yeah i mean we i don't
 

101
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,950
because possible yeah i mean we i don't
we didn't tax out the ram at any point

102
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
we didn't tax out the ram at any point
 

103
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,030
we didn't tax out the ram at any point
no and i was watching that buffer

104
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
no and i was watching that buffer
 

105
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,190
no and i was watching that buffer
i was watching h-top there and and just

106
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
i was watching h-top there and and just
 

107
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,550
i was watching h-top there and and just
kind of keeping an eye on things

108
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
kind of keeping an eye on things
 

109
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,510

cpu got pretty hot at some points and

110
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
cpu got pretty hot at some points and
 

111
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,190

because i only overclocked i was a

112
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
because i only overclocked i was a

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,230
because i only overclocked i was a

114
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
little conservative in
 

115
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,389

in my case overclocking to 1.95

116
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
in my case overclocking to 1.95

um you could go higher than that but

120
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
um you could go higher than that but
 

121
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,350
um you could go higher than that but
then you risk stability issues and

122
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
then you risk stability issues and
 

123
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,229
then you risk stability issues and
things like that or

124
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
things like that or
 

125
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,949
things like that or
the the single board computer crashing

126
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
the the single board computer crashing
 

127
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,830
the the single board computer crashing
uh but the other

128
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
uh but the other
 

129
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,309
uh but the other
opportunity that we have is is with the

130
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
opportunity that we have is is with the
 

131
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,070
opportunity that we have is is with the
raspberry pi uh

132
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
raspberry pi uh
 

133
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,350
raspberry pi uh
400 which does have a stock 1.8

134
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
400 which does have a stock 1.8
 

135

gigahertz
 

137
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,790
gigahertz
processor which we could then bump up to

138
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
processor which we could then bump up to
 

139
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,030
processor which we could then bump up to
maybe 2 or 2.2 gigahertz

140
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
maybe 2 or 2.2 gigahertz
 

141
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,390
maybe 2 or 2.2 gigahertz
that would make a difference so that

142
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
that would make a difference so that
 

143
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,309
that would make a difference so that
might be cool too so i mean you can do

144
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
might be cool too so i mean you can do
 

145
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:34,869
might be cool too so i mean you can do
this on

146
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
this on
 

147
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,990
this on
on the same method can be uh

148
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
on the same method can be uh
 

149
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,229
on the same method can be uh
translated to any single board computer

150
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239

it's just making sure that you've got

152
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
it's just making sure that you've got
 

153
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,150
it's just making sure that you've got
enough power and enough ram but the fact

154
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
enough power and enough ram but the fact
 

155
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,030
enough power and enough ram but the fact
is it worked

156
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
is it worked
 

157
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,509
is it worked
it worked and it really wow really well

158
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
it worked and it really wow really well
 

159
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,630
it worked and it really wow really well
and i mean having com

160
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
and i mean having com
 

161
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,630
and i mean having com
i mean we didn't do the comparison on

162
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
i mean we didn't do the comparison on
 

163
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,710
i mean we didn't do the comparison on
the show but having done it on a pi

164
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
the show but having done it on a pi
 

165
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,229
