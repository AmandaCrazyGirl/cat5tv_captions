you have to use the 64-bit os but why am

374
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
you have to use the 64-bit os but why am
 

375
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,430
you have to use the 64-bit os but why am
i using the 32-bit os then

376
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
i using the 32-bit os then
 

377
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,950
i using the 32-bit os then
it's because they haven't released the

378
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
it's because they haven't released the
 

379
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,550
it's because they haven't released the
64-bit light os

64-bit light os
 

381
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,790
64-bit light os
yet so that is uh the desktop is

and we will inevitably see the light

386
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
and we will inevitably see the light
 

387
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,790
and we will inevitably see the light
version of uh

388
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
version of uh
 

389
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,430
version of uh
of the 64-bit so keep that in mind keep

390
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
of the 64-bit so keep that in mind keep
 

391
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,950
of the 64-bit so keep that in mind keep
watch for it you can install this on

392
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
watch for it you can install this on
 

393
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,629
watch for it you can install this on
your pi right now then back it up and

394
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
your pi right now then back it up and
 

395
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,469
your pi right now then back it up and
then re-install with the 64 bit once

396
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
then re-install with the 64 bit once
 

397
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,749
then re-install with the 64 bit once
it's released and you'll be able to take

398
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
it's released and you'll be able to take
 

399
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,189
it's released and you'll be able to take
advantage of all that ram

400
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
advantage of all that ram
 

401
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,469
advantage of all that ram
in the meantime it's going to overclock

402
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
in the meantime it's going to overclock
 

403
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,430
in the meantime it's going to overclock
to 1.9 gigahertz the default is 1.5 so

404
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
to 1.9 gigahertz the default is 1.5 so
 

405
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,309
to 1.9 gigahertz the default is 1.5 so
that's pretty good but

406
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
that's pretty good but
 

407
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,150
that's pretty good but
conservative because i don't want to

anything like that
so it's just warning me that i'm going

and reboot the pi that's the command

492
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
and reboot the pi that's the command
 

493
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,629
and reboot the pi that's the command
you're going to use

you're going to use
 

495
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,430
you're going to use
from now on similarly the stop command

496

from now on similarly the stop command
 

497
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,350
from now on similarly the stop command
will safely store your blocks and stop

498

will safely store your blocks and stop
 

499
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,469
will safely store your blocks and stop
the minecraft

500
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
the minecraft
 

501
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,469
the minecraft
the minecraft server uh but leave it

502
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
the minecraft server uh but leave it
 

503
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,070
the minecraft server uh but leave it
running so that you can either

504
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
running so that you can either
 

505
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,550
running so that you can either
then halt the system or run a backup or

506
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
then halt the system or run a backup or
 

507
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,830
then halt the system or run a backup or
something like that

508
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
something like that
 

509
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,270
something like that
so both of these commands can take

510
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
so both of these commands can take
 

511
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,749
so both of these commands can take
several minutes just keep that in mind

512
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
several minutes just keep that in mind
 

513
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,029
several minutes just keep that in mind
because they're going to be storing

514
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
because they're going to be storing
 

515
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,950
because they're going to be storing
several days possibly worth of blocks

516
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
several days possibly worth of blocks
 

517
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,469
several days possibly worth of blocks
that are in your ram to

of quickly run around to show you the

556
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
of quickly run around to show you the
 

557
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,790
of quickly run around to show you the
you know that this is performing very

558
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
you know that this is performing very
 

559
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,070
you know that this is performing very
very well

560
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
very well
 

561
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,190
very well
so this is a raspberry pi 4 is the

562
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
so this is a raspberry pi 4 is the
 

563
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,990
so this is a raspberry pi 4 is the
server

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
server
 

565
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,110
server
and i've overclocked it to 1.95

566
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
and i've overclocked it to 1.95
 

567

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,269
gigahertz
it's got 4 gigs of ram and a kingston

570
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
it's got 4 gigs of ram and a kingston

uh endurance microsd card
 

573
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,150
uh endurance microsd card
all right so i wanted to show the

574
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
all right so i wanted to show the
 

575
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,750
all right so i wanted to show the
performance with just me

576
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
performance with just me
 

577
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,509
performance with just me
uh everything looks pretty good and and

578
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
uh everything looks pretty good and and
 

579
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,949
uh everything looks pretty good and and
here at jeff's place

580
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
here at jeff's place
 

581
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,190
here at jeff's place
jeff i guess things should be performing

582
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
jeff i guess things should be performing
 

583
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,590
jeff i guess things should be performing
it poorly here if anywhere right

584
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
it poorly here if anywhere right
 

585
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,269
it poorly here if anywhere right
because you've got all these animals and

586
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
because you've got all these animals and
 

587
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,430
because you've got all these animals and
stuff and that's correct

588
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
stuff and that's correct
 

589
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,310
stuff and that's correct
yeah i tried to to to build a base that

590
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
yeah i tried to to to build a base that
 

591
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,350
yeah i tried to to to build a base that
was busy enough

592
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
was busy enough
 

593
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,790
was busy enough
with lots of elements and so there's

594
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
with lots of elements and so there's
 

595
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,990
with lots of elements and so there's
lots of animals making noise in the

596
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
lots of animals making noise in the
 

597
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,269
lots of animals making noise in the
background i want to try and tax the

598
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
background i want to try and tax the
 

599
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,470
background i want to try and tax the
surfer out

600
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
surfer out
 

601
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,630
surfer out
yeah okay so let's uh let's see what

602
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
yeah okay so let's uh let's see what
 

603
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,910
yeah okay so let's uh let's see what
happens as we start to add players

604
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
happens as we start to add players
 

605
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,949
happens as we start to add players
because i think that was one of the

606
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
because i think that was one of the
 

607
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,230
because i think that was one of the
questions that came up

608
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
questions that came up
 

609
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,829
questions that came up
when you and i were first discussing

610
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
when you and i were first discussing
 

611
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,590
when you and i were first discussing
this project was

612
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
this project was
 

613
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,110
this project was
you know what how many players are going

614
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
you know what how many players are going
 

615
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,430
you know what how many players are going
to be able to come on here

616
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
to be able to come on here
 

617
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,310
to be able to come on here
all right and uh i think i'm the last to

618
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
all right and uh i think i'm the last to
 

619
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,190
all right and uh i think i'm the last to
join

620
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
join
 

621
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,590
join

there's mangled fox 70 yeah oh yeah jeff
 

623
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,069
there's mangled fox 70 yeah oh yeah jeff
maybe it'd be nice if you could join me

624
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
maybe it'd be nice if you could join me
 

625
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,230
maybe it'd be nice if you could join me
there he is that's a random one right

626

643
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,470
animals in the background
and there's i'm not seeing a single

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
and there's i'm not seeing a single
 

645
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,990
and there's i'm not seeing a single
glitch at all no glitches

glitch at all no glitches
 

647
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,910
glitch at all no glitches
it's hard to see right now because it is

740
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680

 

741
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,590

our viewers can see that the performance

742
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
our viewers can see that the performance
 

743
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,710
our viewers can see that the performance
is like

744
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
is like
 

745
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,829
is like
this is probably better than more time

746
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
this is probably better than more time
 

747
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,110
this is probably better than more time
or you would know because you've played

748
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
or you would know because you've played
 

749
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,870
or you would know because you've played
on a lot of online servers

750
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
on a lot of online servers
 

751
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,509
on a lot of online servers
how's the performance of our minecraft

752
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
how's the performance of our minecraft
 

753
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,670
how's the performance of our minecraft
server on a raspberry pi

754
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
server on a raspberry pi
 

755
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,269
server on a raspberry pi
uh compared to some of those online

756
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
uh compared to some of those online
 

757
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,670
uh compared to some of those online
servers

758
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
servers
 

759
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,949
servers
better actually this is better yeah i

760
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
better actually this is better yeah i
 

761
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,829
better actually this is better yeah i
would agree

762
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
would agree
 

763
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,590
would agree
i i have that's what i've been told

764
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
i i have that's what i've been told
 

765
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,829
i i have that's what i've been told
there's way less players though

766
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
there's way less players though
 

767
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,430
there's way less players though
but i mean there i have a free server

768
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
but i mean there i have a free server
 

769
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,350
but i mean there i have a free server
that uh i've used with my kids and

770
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
that uh i've used with my kids and
 

771
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,990
that uh i've used with my kids and
we get lag issues when it's just the

772
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
we get lag issues when it's just the
 

773
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,230
we get lag issues when it's just the
four of us on

774
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
four of us on
 

775
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,790
four of us on
so the fact that this is a raspberry pi

776
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
so the fact that this is a raspberry pi
 

777
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,310
so the fact that this is a raspberry pi
and there's what

778
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
and there's what
 

779
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,670
and there's what
nine of us it's sorry my my my internet

780
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
nine of us it's sorry my my my internet
 

781
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,430
nine of us it's sorry my my my internet
just dropped out so i lost you for a

782
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
just dropped out so i lost you for a
 

783
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,990
just dropped out so i lost you for a
second there

784
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
second there
 

785
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,910
second there
you were talking jeff well i was just

786
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
you were talking jeff well i was just
 

787
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,910
you were talking jeff well i was just
saying that i have a

788
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
saying that i have a
 

789
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,670
saying that i have a
um a free server

790
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
um a free server
 

791
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,629
um a free server
that i use with my kids oh okay like

792
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
that i use with my kids oh okay like
 

793
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,990
that i use with my kids oh okay like
online like a cloud

794
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
online like a cloud
 

795
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,269
online like a cloud
online okay yeah and it is

796
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
online okay yeah and it is
 

797
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,069
online okay yeah and it is
um it can be quite laggy sometimes when

798
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
um it can be quite laggy sometimes when
 

799
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,750
um it can be quite laggy sometimes when
it's just the four of us

800
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
it's just the four of us
 

801
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,069
it's just the four of us
so this performs exceptionally better

802
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
so this performs exceptionally better
 

803
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,990
so this performs exceptionally better
than that

804
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
than that
 

805
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,389
than that
and i've i've also paid for servers

806
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
and i've i've also paid for servers
 

807
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,910
and i've i've also paid for servers
where it's you know 60

808
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
where it's you know 60
 

809
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,030
where it's you know 60
a year and this is

810
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
a year and this is
 

811
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,910
a year and this is
