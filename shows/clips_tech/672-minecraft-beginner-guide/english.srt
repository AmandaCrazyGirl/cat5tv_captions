484
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
towards
 

485
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,350
towards
some sort of a hill because

486
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
some sort of a hill because
 

487
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,110
some sort of a hill because
they generally have some sort of

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
uh cave system like this
 

491
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,070
uh cave system like this
where you can get deeper and deeper in

but one thing i want to point out that i
saw in the hill just above me

508
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399

 

509
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,670

is coal oh

510
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
is coal oh
 

511
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,829
is coal oh
where did i see the coal somewhere over

512

where did i see the coal somewhere over
 

513
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:39,990
where did i see the coal somewhere over
here

514
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
here
 

515
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,430
here
and you're going to just learn to

516
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
and you're going to just learn to
 

517
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,110
and you're going to just learn to
recognize these blocks

518
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
recognize these blocks
 

519
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,430
recognize these blocks
just by the way that they appear so i'm

520
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
just by the way that they appear so i'm
 

521
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,550
just by the way that they appear so i'm
going to show you here i'm trying to

522
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
going to show you here i'm trying to
 

523
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,990
going to show you here i'm trying to
mine with my hand

524
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
mine with my hand
 

525
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,190
mine with my hand
it's taken a while to get through the

526
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
it's taken a while to get through the
 

527
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,550
it's taken a while to get through the
block but you can see it's slowly

528
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
block but you can see it's slowly
 

529
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,110
block but you can see it's slowly
cracking

530
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
cracking
 

531
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,389
cracking
okay so that's with my hand now if i go

532
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
okay so that's with my hand now if i go
 

533
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,470
okay so that's with my hand now if i go
to my pickaxe

534
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480

 

535
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,030

that was so much faster yeah

536
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040

 

537
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,269

so you can see how much faster it goes

538
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
so you can see how much faster it goes
 

539
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,070
so you can see how much faster it goes

torches as you see as i'm grabbing these
 

547
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,550
torches as you see as i'm grabbing these
elements

548
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
elements
 

549
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,509
elements
i'm getting more and more recipes you

550

um pickaxe or sorry a wood
 

627
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,710
um pickaxe or sorry a wood
axe which would make mining a tree that

628
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
axe which would make mining a tree that
 

629
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,990
axe which would make mining a tree that
much faster

630
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
much faster
 

631
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,710
much faster
not to work because i still have enough

632
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
not to work because i still have enough
 

633

i'm going to come back down here to my
crafting table

642
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
crafting table
 

643

and i need to make these spruce planks
again

646
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
again
 

647
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,910
again
so if you have a lot of resources you

648
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920

can't say it as i've tried
but um the sun is starting to go down

834
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
but um the sun is starting to go down
 

835
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,670
but um the sun is starting to go down
and you can see in the horizon we're

836
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
and you can see in the horizon we're
 

837
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,389
and you can see in the horizon we're
getting that

838
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
getting that
 

839
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,910
getting that
like dusk color nice or sorry uh

840
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
like dusk color nice or sorry uh
 

841
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,470
like dusk color nice or sorry uh
yeah dusk um so it's kind of got that

842
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
yeah dusk um so it's kind of got that
 

843
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,230
yeah dusk um so it's kind of got that
pink tone to it when that happens

844
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
pink tone to it when that happens
 

845
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,230
pink tone to it when that happens
you want to get back to your base of

846
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
you want to get back to your base of
 

847
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,750
you want to get back to your base of
safe operations

848
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
safe operations
 

849
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,670
safe operations
uh otherwise what's gonna happen is mobs

850
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
uh otherwise what's gonna happen is mobs
 

851
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,670
uh otherwise what's gonna happen is mobs
are going to spawn

852
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
are going to spawn
 

853
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,949
are going to spawn
and when it comes to torches one thing i

854
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
and when it comes to torches one thing i
 

855
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,990
and when it comes to torches one thing i
will mention is they produce light

856
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
will mention is they produce light
 

857
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,509
will mention is they produce light
um for an area of

858
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
um for an area of
 

859
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,509
um for an area of
six blocks that will prevent a mob from

860
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
six blocks that will prevent a mob from
 

861
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,710
six blocks that will prevent a mob from
spawning

862
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
spawning
 

863
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,750
spawning
so if you put a torch down nothing will

864
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
so if you put a torch down nothing will
 

865
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,470
so if you put a torch down nothing will
spawn within six blocks so one two three

866
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
spawn within six blocks so one two three
 

867
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,990
spawn within six blocks so one two three
four five six this is a safe zone for

868
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
four five six this is a safe zone for
 

869
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,949
four five six this is a safe zone for
light

870
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
light
 

871
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,509
light
this is not it doesn't look like much of

872
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
this is not it doesn't look like much of
 

873
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,949
this is not it doesn't look like much of
a difference but the mechanics of the

874
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
a difference but the mechanics of the
 

875
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,910
a difference but the mechanics of the
game

876
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
game
 

877
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,829
game
says that this is dark enough something

878
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
says that this is dark enough something
 

879
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,949
says that this is dark enough something
is gonna spawn

880
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
is gonna spawn
 

881
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,910
is gonna spawn
okay which you don't want to do so yeah

882
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
okay which you don't want to do so yeah
 

883
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,310
okay which you don't want to do so yeah
and if

884
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
and if
 

885
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,310
and if
if it does spawn can it walk into the

886
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
if it does spawn can it walk into the
 

887
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,470
if it does spawn can it walk into the
light it can walk into the light once it

888
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
light it can walk into the light once it
 

889
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,910
light it can walk into the light once it
spawns yes

890
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
spawns yes
 

891
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,110
spawns yes
and so you want to have enough light

892
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
and so you want to have enough light
 

893
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,990
and so you want to have enough light
around your base area that nothing is

894
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
around your base area that nothing is
 

895
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,350
around your base area that nothing is
really going to spawn

896
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
really going to spawn
 

897
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,150
really going to spawn
near you if you are comfortable enough

898
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
near you if you are comfortable enough
 

899
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,590
near you if you are comfortable enough
doing that especially at night now you

900
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
doing that especially at night now you
 

901
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,189
doing that especially at night now you
see there's the moon the moon's coming

902
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
see there's the moon the moon's coming
 

903
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,310
see there's the moon the moon's coming
up

904
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
up
 

905
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,389
up
there is a creeper i want to avoid it

906
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
there is a creeper i want to avoid it
 

907
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,990
there is a creeper i want to avoid it
over there

908
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
over there
 

909
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,310
over there
so i'm going to run down to my base open

910
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
so i'm going to run down to my base open
 

911
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,069
so i'm going to run down to my base open
my door

912
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
my door
 

913
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,629
my door
close it now they do not open doors

914
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
close it now they do not open doors
 

915
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,629
close it now they do not open doors
unless you build your game into hardcore

916
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
unless you build your game into hardcore
 

917
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,430
unless you build your game into hardcore
mode

918
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
mode
 

919
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,949
mode
uh then they will break down doors and

920
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
uh then they will break down doors and
 

921
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,269
uh then they will break down doors and
come in but right now it's nighttime

922
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
come in but right now it's nighttime
 

923
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,069
come in but right now it's nighttime
i'm effectively safe here okay and so i

924
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
i'm effectively safe here okay and so i
 

925
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,790
i'm effectively safe here okay and so i
think that's a great spot to stop

926
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
think that's a great spot to stop
 

927
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,310
think that's a great spot to stop
fantastic yeah a good start for sure so

928
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
fantastic yeah a good start for sure so
 

929
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,629
fantastic yeah a good start for sure so
what's next in the game like what what

930
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
what's next in the game like what what
 

931
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,670
what's next in the game like what what
happens next for us

932
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
happens next for us
 

933
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,710
happens next for us
so at this point you start exploring

934
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
so at this point you start exploring
 

935
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,790
so at this point you start exploring
you want to explore you want to

936
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
you want to explore you want to
 

937
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,470
you want to explore you want to
understand the achievements you want to

938
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
understand the achievements you want to
 

939
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,150
understand the achievements you want to
take it to the next level so

940
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
take it to the next level so
 

941
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,150
take it to the next level so
you saw that i started to collect some

942
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
you saw that i started to collect some
 

943
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,749
you saw that i started to collect some
stone yeah when i was looking for the

944
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
stone yeah when i was looking for the
 

945
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,550
stone yeah when i was looking for the
coal

946
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
coal
 

947
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,790
coal
so now you have the ability to make or i

948
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
so now you have the ability to make or i
 

949
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,550
so now you have the ability to make or i
have the ability to make stone tools as

950
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
have the ability to make stone tools as
 

951
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,310
have the ability to make stone tools as
opposed to wood tools

952
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
opposed to wood tools
 

953
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,150
opposed to wood tools
and then obviously stone tools are

954
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
and then obviously stone tools are
 

955
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,430
and then obviously stone tools are
stronger than wood tools

956
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
stronger than wood tools
 

957
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,710
stronger than wood tools
right then you're going to want to start

958
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
right then you're going to want to start
 

959
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,629
right then you're going to want to start
exploring and mining because the deeper

960
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
exploring and mining because the deeper
 

961
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,269
exploring and mining because the deeper
you go

962
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
you go
 

963
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,110
you go
into the earth the more you're getting

964
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
into the earth the more you're getting
 

965
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,710
into the earth the more you're getting
getting valuable resources and a little

966
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
getting valuable resources and a little
 

967
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,990
getting valuable resources and a little
bit there when i was looking into the

968
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
bit there when i was looking into the
 

969
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,550
bit there when i was looking into the
cave

970
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
cave
 

971
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,509
cave
i said oh there's some iron yeah iron is

972
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
i said oh there's some iron yeah iron is
 

973
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:39,829
i said oh there's some iron yeah iron is
uh

974
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
uh
 

975
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,150
uh
obviously stronger than stone right okay

976
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
obviously stronger than stone right okay
 

977
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,790
obviously stronger than stone right okay
so an iron pickaxe is gonna do

978
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
so an iron pickaxe is gonna do
 

979
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,430
so an iron pickaxe is gonna do
go a lot further for mining than a stone

980
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
go a lot further for mining than a stone
 

981
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,470
go a lot further for mining than a stone
pickaxe would

982
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
pickaxe would
 

983
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,350
pickaxe would
and so you're going to have to

984
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
and so you're going to have to
 

985
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,389
and so you're going to have to
continually re um

986
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
continually re um
 

987
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,310
continually re um
you know stock up on some of those base

988
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
you know stock up on some of those base
 

989
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,590
you know stock up on some of those base
resources like you're always going to

990
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
resources like you're always going to
 

991
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,629
resources like you're always going to
need wood

992
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
need wood
 

993
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,310
need wood
what is a core component of just about

994
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
what is a core component of just about
 

995
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,990
what is a core component of just about
everything in there

996
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
everything in there
 

997
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,749
everything in there
stone is used in a lot of things then

998
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
stone is used in a lot of things then
 

999
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,949
stone is used in a lot of things then
you're going to get into the more rare

1000
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
you're going to get into the more rare
 

1001
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,549
you're going to get into the more rare
ones like iron

1002
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
ones like iron
 

1003
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,549
ones like iron
uh and then diamond diamond spawns

1004
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
uh and then diamond diamond spawns
 

1005
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,630
uh and then diamond diamond spawns
most common spawn isn't the right word

1006
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
most common spawn isn't the right word
 

1007
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,309
most common spawn isn't the right word
but it generates most common between

1008
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
but it generates most common between
 

1009
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,309
but it generates most common between
blocks 12 and 14

1010
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
blocks 12 and 14
 

1011
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,990
blocks 12 and 14
uh when you're playing your game all

1012
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
uh when you're playing your game all
 

1013
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,069
uh when you're playing your game all
right this will all make sense to you

1014
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
right this will all make sense to you
 

1015
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,470
right this will all make sense to you
later on later yeah but when you're

1016
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
later on later yeah but when you're
 

1017
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,829
later on later yeah but when you're
playing on your computer

1018
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
f3 is going to bring up the
 

1021
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,429
f3 is going to bring up the
game kind of stats you'll be able to see

1022
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
game kind of stats you'll be able to see
 

1023
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,789
game kind of stats you'll be able to see
the blocks you're looking at

1024
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
the blocks you're looking at
 

1025
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,150
the blocks you're looking at
tell where you are in the world if you

1026
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
tell where you are in the world if you
 

1027
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,150
tell where you are in the world if you
need to find your coordinates that kind

1028
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
need to find your coordinates that kind
 

1029
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,669
need to find your coordinates that kind
of stuff and so when you start mining

1030
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
of stuff and so when you start mining
 

1031
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,549
of stuff and so when you start mining
down

1032
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
down
 

1033
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,909
down
you're going to want to go down to block

1034
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
you're going to want to go down to block
 

1035
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,669
you're going to want to go down to block
12 to 14 to get those diamonds again

1036
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
12 to 14 to get those diamonds again
 

1037
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,669
12 to 14 to get those diamonds again
that's more advanced stuff

1038
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
that's more advanced stuff
 

1039
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,590
that's more advanced stuff
but we're not even going to get into

1040
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
but we're not even going to get into
 

1041
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,870
but we're not even going to get into
that stuff right now but that's the

1042
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
that stuff right now but that's the
 

1043
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,230

excellent we generated a

1074
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
excellent we generated a
 

1075
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,750
excellent we generated a
villager spawning section where

1076
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
villager spawning section where
 

1077
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,590
villager spawning section where
the villagers when they have enough food

1078
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
the villagers when they have enough food
 

1079
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,510
the villagers when they have enough food
they'll breed and have more villagers

1080
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
they'll breed and have more villagers
 

1081
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,070
they'll breed and have more villagers
and then we used a train track system to

1082
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
and then we used a train track system to
 

1083
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,510
and then we used a train track system to
transport them from one village to

1084
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
transport them from one village to
 

1085
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,190
transport them from one village to
another to create a villager trading

yeah which then gives us access to a

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
yeah which then gives us access to a
 

1091
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,029
yeah which then gives us access to a
whole bunch of new resources that

1092
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
whole bunch of new resources that
 

1093
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,710
whole bunch of new resources that
otherwise we'd have to go exploring to

1094
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
otherwise we'd have to go exploring to
 

1095
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,350
otherwise we'd have to go exploring to

but they'll trade with us so that's

1098
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
but they'll trade with us so that's
 

1099
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,990
but they'll trade with us so that's
probably the most advanced thing we've

1100
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
probably the most advanced thing we've
 

1101
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,470
probably the most advanced thing we've
built

1102

i'm glad that i was a part of it yeah

1104
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
i'm glad that i was a part of it yeah
 

1105
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,470
i'm glad that i was a part of it yeah
yeah i mean and me being the noob like

1106
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
yeah i mean and me being the noob like
 

1107
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,630
yeah i mean and me being the noob like
i'm learning the mechanics and so

1108
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
i'm learning the mechanics and so
 

1109
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,350
i'm learning the mechanics and so
the the basically the ability to have

1110
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
the the basically the ability to have
 

1111
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,310
the the basically the ability to have
villagers

1112
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
villagers
 

1113
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,909
villagers
um uh breed is like part of the

1114
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
um uh breed is like part of the
 

1115
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,990
um uh breed is like part of the
mechanics of the game and so i created

1116
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
mechanics of the game and so i created
 

1117
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,070
mechanics of the game and so i created
a system that would allow that to happen

1118
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
a system that would allow that to happen
 

1119
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,270
a system that would allow that to happen
automatically yes

1120
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
automatically yes
 

1121
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,029
automatically yes
um so that's that's been a lot of fun

1122
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
um so that's that's been a lot of fun
 

1123
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,870
um so that's that's been a lot of fun
and it's a lot of fun to to do these

1124
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
and it's a lot of fun to to do these
 

1125
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,350
and it's a lot of fun to to do these
