554
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,230
or five hundred dollars a month to run
 

555
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,200
or five hundred dollars a month to run
HD video through LTE even though we were

556
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,210
HD video through LTE even though we were
 

557
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,650
HD video through LTE even though we were
only here four times a month and then we

558

it with LTE back up so it has failover

594
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:31,780
it with LTE back up so it has failover
 

595
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,580
it with LTE back up so it has failover
to LT

596
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:32,590
to LT
 

597
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,910
to LT
II so if our internet goes down we still

598
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
II so if our internet goes down we still
 

599
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,820
II so if our internet goes down we still
have LTE speeds which are 20 Meg's a

600
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:38,830
have LTE speeds which are 20 Meg's a
 

601
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,140
have LTE speeds which are 20 Meg's a
second anyways so I I thought redundancy

602
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,150
second anyways so I I thought redundancy
 

603
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,430
second anyways so I I thought redundancy
was really important so I'm getting that

604
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,440
was really important so I'm getting that
 

605

category 5 because Coppa makes it so we

1204
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,360
category 5 because Coppa makes it so we
 

1205
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,810
category 5 because Coppa makes it so we
can't monetize it anymore so that means

1206
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:18,820
can't monetize it anymore so that means
 

1207
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,050
can't monetize it anymore so that means
any cost that we put into it and having

1208
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,060
any cost that we put into it and having
 

1209
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,540
any cost that we put into it and having

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:27,700
month to run then yeah and then plus the
 

1213
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,570
month to run then yeah and then plus the
production costs of the show so so the

1214
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:30,580
production costs of the show so so the
 

1215
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,460
production costs of the show so so the
