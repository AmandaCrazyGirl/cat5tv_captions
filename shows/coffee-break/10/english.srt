00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:22,910
so yeah so here's hoping they've they've
 

311
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,280
so yeah so here's hoping they've they've
got something because I don't think our

312
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,290
got something because I don't think our
 

313
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,050
got something because I don't think our
ubiquity will reach that far stringing

314
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,060
ubiquity will reach that far stringing
 

315
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,730
ubiquity will reach that far stringing
fiber to Newfoundland and see what

316
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:30,740
fiber to Newfoundland and see what
 

317
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,710
fiber to Newfoundland and see what
happens I'm gonna put this spool in the

318
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:35,720
happens I'm gonna put this spool in the
 

319
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,010
happens I'm gonna put this spool in the
back of your truck I wanna go out as you

320
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,020
back of your truck I wanna go out as you
 

321
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:48,220
back of your truck I wanna go out as you
draw hold onto this end you just drive I

322
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,230
draw hold onto this end you just drive I
 

323
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,740
draw hold onto this end you just drive I
think it'd be more than 3000 meters

324
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:50,750
think it'd be more than 3000 meters
 

325
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,500
think it'd be more than 3000 meters
though just a little just a little yeah

326
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,510
though just a little just a little yeah
 

327
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,700
though just a little just a little yeah
yeah well I stayed up way too late last

328
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:57,710
yeah well I stayed up way too late last
 

329
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,330
yeah well I stayed up way too late last
night

330
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:58,340
night
 

331
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,840
night
oh yeah budding up on the on the pint

332
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:01,850
oh yeah budding up on the on the pint
 

333
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,670
oh yeah budding up on the on the pint
I'm the wearable are you still watch you

334
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm the wearable are you still watch you
 

335
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,050
I'm the wearable are you still watch you
didn't get it yet so you're sitting

336
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,060
didn't get it yet so you're sitting
 

337
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,570
didn't get it yet so you're sitting
there cousin it hasn't arrived yet

338
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:12,580

 

339
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,790

mm-hmm yep yeah and it's very

340
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:15,800
mm-hmm yep yeah and it's very
 

341
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,500
mm-hmm yep yeah and it's very
interesting to see the eye it looks to

342
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,510
interesting to see the eye it looks to
 

343
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,230
interesting to see the eye it looks to
me like and I've sort of touched on this

344
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,240
me like and I've sort of touched on this
 

345
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,510
me like and I've sort of touched on this
before Robbie yeah it looks to me like

346
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
before Robbie yeah it looks to me like
 

347
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,900
before Robbie yeah it looks to me like
you'd load one image that has one

348
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:28,910
you'd load one image that has one
 

349
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,010
you'd load one image that has one
program in it it starts you can do this

350
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,020
program in it it starts you can do this
 

351
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,560
program in it it starts you can do this
with see your rust away or whatever you

352
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:35,570
with see your rust away or whatever you
 

353
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:41,020
with see your rust away or whatever you
want to to use I like see because I am

354
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,030
want to to use I like see because I am
 

355
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,480
want to to use I like see because I am
much more familiar with seed than I am

356
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,490
much more familiar with seed than I am
 

357
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,720
much more familiar with seed than I am
with C++ or rust so I'm I'm not going to

358
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,730
with C++ or rust so I'm I'm not going to
 

359
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,150
with C++ or rust so I'm I'm not going to
try rust I'm gonna just do it with C

360
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
try rust I'm gonna just do it with C
 

361
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,000
try rust I'm gonna just do it with C
it's the same

362
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,010
it's the same
 

363
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,930
it's the same
I did with the Arduino and I'm gonna

364
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:56,940
I did with the Arduino and I'm gonna
 

365
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,880
I did with the Arduino and I'm gonna
study up more on the actual hardware

366
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,890
study up more on the actual hardware
 

367
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,710
study up more on the actual hardware
that's included especially the display

368
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
that's included especially the display
 

369
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,340
that's included especially the display
because it's weird when you look at the

370
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,350
because it's weird when you look at the
 

371
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,400
because it's weird when you look at the
existing implementations that are out

372
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,410
existing implementations that are out
 

373
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,280
existing implementations that are out
there on github or gitlab its github it

374
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,290
there on github or gitlab its github it
 

375
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,700
there on github or gitlab its github it
seems like a lot of the developers have

376
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:16,710
seems like a lot of the developers have
 

377
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,890
seems like a lot of the developers have
taken the approach of of drawing or

378
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:21,900
taken the approach of of drawing or
 

379
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,620
taken the approach of of drawing or
rather displaying a graphical image on

380
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:24,630
rather displaying a graphical image on
 

381
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,630
rather displaying a graphical image on
the on the watch face and I don't

382
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
the on the watch face and I don't
 

383
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,610
the on the watch face and I don't
understand why they've done that I think

384
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:31,620
understand why they've done that I think
 

385
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,010
understand why they've done that I think
that you can drive the thing like a

386
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,020
that you can drive the thing like a
 

387
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,670
that you can drive the thing like a
regular graphics tablet you know like a

388
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
regular graphics tablet you know like a
 

389
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,250
regular graphics tablet you know like a
regular with vector graphics right I

390
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,260
regular with vector graphics right I
 

391
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,990
regular with vector graphics right I
would imagine that would be just a

392
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
would imagine that would be just a
 

393
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,110
would imagine that would be just a
little more efficient than then you know

394
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
little more efficient than then you know
 

395
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,130
little more efficient than then you know
taking a PNG converting it to a C header

396
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,140
taking a PNG converting it to a C header
 

397
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,130
taking a PNG converting it to a C header
with a bunch of Hick's numbers in it

398
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,140
with a bunch of Hick's numbers in it
 

399
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,670
with a bunch of Hick's numbers in it
letting that on the screen a bit slow

400
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:54,680
letting that on the screen a bit slow
 

401
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,140
letting that on the screen a bit slow
the vehicle you think the vector will be

402
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,150
the vehicle you think the vector will be
 

403
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,480
the vehicle you think the vector will be
slow nothing the big of these yeah but

404
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,490
slow nothing the big of these yeah but
 

405
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,640
slow nothing the big of these yeah but
trying to do the conversion once though

406
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:04,650
trying to do the conversion once though
 

407
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,430
trying to do the conversion once though
right so once once you've done the

408
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
right so once once you've done the
 

409
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,230
right so once once you've done the
conversion now you've got the header

410
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,240
conversion now you've got the header
 

411
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,450
conversion now you've got the header
file but it's fixed you can't change it

412
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:11,460
file but it's fixed you can't change it
 

413
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,340
file but it's fixed you can't change it
after that you can listen just play it

414
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,350
after that you can listen just play it
 

415
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,330
after that you can listen just play it
is it like a any animated sprite no it

416
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:17,340
is it like a any animated sprite no it
 

417
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,240
is it like a any animated sprite no it
is just a single PNG and you just splat

418
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,250
is just a single PNG and you just splat
 

419
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,180
is just a single PNG and you just splat
it up on the screen okay at least that's

420
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,190
it up on the screen okay at least that's
 

421
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,050
it up on the screen okay at least that's
how I see it

422
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,060
how I see it
 

423
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,300
how I see it
it looks go away in order to know what

424
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,310
it looks go away in order to know what
 

425
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,400
it looks go away in order to know what
time it is you have to reflash every one

426
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,410
time it is you have to reflash every one
 

427
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,950
time it is you have to reflash every one
minute well I think that well that's the

428
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:33,960
minute well I think that well that's the
 

429
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,480
minute well I think that well that's the
part that I'm still trying to figure out

430
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,490
part that I'm still trying to figure out
 

431
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,860
part that I'm still trying to figure out
I think that there are literally PNG

432
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:39,870
I think that there are literally PNG
 

433
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,230
I think that there are literally PNG
images of each of the arms of the watch

434
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
images of each of the arms of the watch
 

435
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,990
images of each of the arms of the watch
you know the larger and you literally

436
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,000
you know the larger and you literally
 

437
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,180
you know the larger and you literally
move it around the clock face right

438
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,190
move it around the clock face right
 

439
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,210
move it around the clock face right
that's apparently the way it works but

440
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,220
that's apparently the way it works but
 

441
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,960
that's apparently the way it works but
it's analog yeah

442
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:52,970
it's analog yeah
 

443
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,460
it's analog yeah
well it's a it's a graph yeah it's a

444
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,470
well it's a it's a graph yeah it's a
 

445
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,160
well it's a it's a graph yeah it's a
graphics object that you have to redraw

446
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,170
graphics object that you have to redraw
 

447
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,560
graphics object that you have to redraw
each time I just can't help thinking

448
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:00,570
each time I just can't help thinking
 

449
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,710
each time I just can't help thinking
that a victory implementation would

450
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:03,720
that a victory implementation would
 

451
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,320
that a victory implementation would
probably be faster you start with that

452
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,330
probably be faster you start with that
 

453
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,360
probably be faster you start with that
spider

454
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,370
spider
 

455
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,670
spider
you just go hit I can't wait I can't

456
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:12,680
you just go hit I can't wait I can't
 

457
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,440
you just go hit I can't wait I can't
wait to see what you come up with vp9

458
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,450
wait to see what you come up with vp9
 

459
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,380
wait to see what you come up with vp9
mm-hmm yeah well I've got more studying

460
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,390
mm-hmm yeah well I've got more studying
 

461
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,540
mm-hmm yeah well I've got more studying
to do yet more like unites now pretty

462
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:22,550
to do yet more like unites now pretty
 

463
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,440
to do yet more like unites now pretty
just listed a but don't tell about work

464
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,450

use the Arduino as the base this is a

890
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,280
use the Arduino as the base this is a

892
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:28,950
shield that goes on top that takes a GPS
 

893
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,850
shield that goes on top that takes a GPS
module and the idea is that once the GPS

894
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:31,860
module and the idea is that once the GPS
 

895
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,020
module and the idea is that once the GPS
locks then that shield actually contains

896
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,030
locks then that shield actually contains
 

897
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,620
locks then that shield actually contains
a 2-meter transmitter that you can use

938
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:51,630
about for coming up as a mom in a
 

939
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,100
about for coming up as a mom in a
waiting to get above about 70 makes and

940
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,110
waiting to get above about 70 makes and
 

941
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,720
waiting to get above about 70 makes and
then I will go back oh my god

942
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:56,730
then I will go back oh my god
 

943
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,630
then I will go back oh my god
is there no propagation at all or is it

944
00:24:59,630 --> 00:24:59,640
is there no propagation at all or is it
 

945
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,260
is there no propagation at all or is it
a trouble oh wow it may flap a very long

946
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,270
a trouble oh wow it may flap a very long
 

947
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,840
a trouble oh wow it may flap a very long
time with that venneman men among men

948
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:05,850
time with that venneman men among men
 

949
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,600
time with that venneman men among men
among a minimun a bloody paper yeah all

950
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:11,610
among a minimun a bloody paper yeah all
 

951
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,500
among a minimun a bloody paper yeah all
right well hmm okay it normally cycles

952
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:15,510
right well hmm okay it normally cycles
 

953
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,430
right well hmm okay it normally cycles
over like four or five years has it not

954
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
over like four or five years has it not
 

955
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,030
over like four or five years has it not
been improving over time or no it didn't

956
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,040
been improving over time or no it didn't
 

957
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,780
been improving over time or no it didn't
improve it it don't it went up a zero

958
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:26,790
improve it it don't it went up a zero
 

959
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,620
improve it it don't it went up a zero
all the time and yep didn't rise above

960
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:30,630
all the time and yep didn't rise above
 

961
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,400
all the time and yep didn't rise above
anything really any of any good name

962
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,410
anything really any of any good name
 

963
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,290
anything really any of any good name
negative they met with an in good either

964
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:36,300
negative they met with an in good either
 

965
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,080
negative they met with an in good either
so you're not hearing any of the beacons

966
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,090
so you're not hearing any of the beacons
 

967
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:45,710
so you're not hearing any of the beacons
no no nothing oh wow okay to let you

968
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:45,720
no no nothing oh wow okay to let you
 

969
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,300
no no nothing oh wow okay to let you
know Robbie what happens in the ham

970
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,310
know Robbie what happens in the ham
 

971
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,280
know Robbie what happens in the ham
radio world is that there are beacons

972
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,290
radio world is that there are beacons
 

973
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,910
radio world is that there are beacons
that transmit on certain frequencies in

974
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:52,920
that transmit on certain frequencies in
 

975
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,930
that transmit on certain frequencies in
or in each of the ham radio band so that

976
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:56,940
or in each of the ham radio band so that
 

977
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,270
or in each of the ham radio band so that
you know they transmit all around the

978
00:25:59,270 --> 00:25:59,280
you know they transmit all around the
 

979
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,340
you know they transmit all around the
world they're located all over the world

980
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:01,350
world they're located all over the world
 

981
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,570
world they're located all over the world
you can use those to judge what the

982
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,580
you can use those to judge what the
 

983
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,950
you can use those to judge what the
propagation is like from that location

984
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
propagation is like from that location
 

985
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,990
propagation is like from that location
and hopefully what it would be like

986
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,000
and hopefully what it would be like
 

987
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,270
and hopefully what it would be like
elsewhere but sounds like they have not

988
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,280
elsewhere but sounds like they have not
 

989
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,690
elsewhere but sounds like they have not
even though the conditions are not good

990
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:17,700
even though the conditions are not good
 

991
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,450
even though the conditions are not good
even to hear the beacons which is

992
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:19,460
even to hear the beacons which is
 

993
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,710
even to hear the beacons which is
unfortunate yes well I've got a baby on

994
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
unfortunate yes well I've got a baby on
 

995
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,490
unfortunate yes well I've got a baby on
a dyno

996

I've got a 100 and I wrote a flash GoPro

998
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,050
I've got a 100 and I wrote a flash GoPro
 

999

I've got a 100 and I wrote a flash GoPro
then that I can run it remote from any

1000
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:34,440
then that I can run it remote from any
 

1001
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,170
then that I can run it remote from any
computer anywhere in the world

1002
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,180
computer anywhere in the world
 

1003
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,760
computer anywhere in the world
no that's cool

1004
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:37,770
no that's cool
 

1005
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,890
no that's cool
no I was thinking about that just the

1006
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:39,900
no I was thinking about that just the
 

1007
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,330
no I was thinking about that just the
other day I thought wouldn't it be neat

1008
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,340
other day I thought wouldn't it be neat
 

1009
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,210
other day I thought wouldn't it be neat
to have a remote like I was thinking in

1010
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,220
to have a remote like I was thinking in
 

1011
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,310
to have a remote like I was thinking in
terms of a walkie-talkie right so that

1012
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
terms of a walkie-talkie right so that
 

1013
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,230
terms of a walkie-talkie right so that
like you guys could actually like go on

1014
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
like you guys could actually like go on
 

1015
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,060
like you guys could actually like go on
your computer and what would like to

1016
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,070
your computer and what would like to
 

1017
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,669
your computer and what would like to
send a signal to my walkie-talkie that

1018
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:52,679
send a signal to my walkie-talkie that
 

1019
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,299
send a signal to my walkie-talkie that
already happened what kind of it we can

1020
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:56,309
already happened what kind of it we can
 

1021
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:59,510
already happened what kind of it we can
already do that I am I think it's cold

1022
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
already do that I am I think it's cold
 

1023
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,640
already do that I am I think it's cold
or echo like here's another one where

1024
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:04,650
or echo like here's another one where
 

1025
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,830
or echo like here's another one where
what you do is if you can reach a

1026
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:06,840
what you do is if you can reach a
 

1027
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,460
what you do is if you can reach a
repeater that is echo link or IR LM

1028
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:09,470
repeater that is echo link or IR LM
 

1029
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,180
repeater that is echo link or IR LM
enabled you can send the DTMF tones too

1030
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,190
enabled you can send the DTMF tones too
 

1031
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,730
enabled you can send the DTMF tones too
and need to enable the link from your

1032
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:16,740
and need to enable the link from your
 

1033
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,299
and need to enable the link from your
repeater

1034
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:17,309
repeater
 

1035
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:21,440
repeater
to the one in Barrie Ontario or the one

1036
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,450
to the one in Barrie Ontario or the one
 

1037
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,500
to the one in Barrie Ontario or the one
in Ireland right that uses the Internet

1038
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:24,510
in Ireland right that uses the Internet
 

1039
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,720
in Ireland right that uses the Internet
to interlink the two repeaters and then

1040
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:26,730
to interlink the two repeaters and then
 

1041
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,760
to interlink the two repeaters and then
anything you hear on one repeater gets

1042
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:28,770
anything you hear on one repeater gets
 

1043
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,799
anything you hear on one repeater gets
retransmitted on the other and so you

1044
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:30,809
retransmitted on the other and so you
 

1045
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:33,320
retransmitted on the other and so you
can literally talk to each other over

1046
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:33,330
can literally talk to each other over
 

1047
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,770
can literally talk to each other over
the over the Internet yeah I used to

1048
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:36,780
the over the Internet yeah I used to
 

1049
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,110
the over the Internet yeah I used to
Ramage at one time out there but people

1050
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
Ramage at one time out there but people
 

1051
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,810
Ramage at one time out there but people
do go beauty and I have to shut it down

1052
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:43,820
do go beauty and I have to shut it down
 

1053
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,740
do go beauty and I have to shut it down
that's unfortunate

1054
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:45,750
that's unfortunate
 

1055
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,130
that's unfortunate
I may be setting up a private setting up

1056
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:49,140
I may be setting up a private setting up
 

1057
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,160
I may be setting up a private setting up
a private one would be a fun project

1058
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,170
a private one would be a fun project
 

1059
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,970
a private one would be a fun project
like well you have to be careful about

1060
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:55,980
like well you have to be careful about
 

1061
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,260
like well you have to be careful about
that because as the ham radio

1062
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,270
that because as the ham radio
 

1063
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,180
that because as the ham radio
regulations so you cannot send anything

1064
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,190
regulations so you cannot send anything
 

1065
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,860
regulations so you cannot send anything
encrypted over the airwaves it has to be

1066
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:05,870
encrypted over the airwaves it has to be
 

1067
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:10,060
encrypted over the airwaves it has to be
it has to be legibly it's gotta be open

1068
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,070
it has to be legibly it's gotta be open
 

1069
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:15,740
it has to be legibly it's gotta be open
but if the transmitter and receiver was

1070
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:15,750
but if the transmitter and receiver was
 

1071
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,880
but if the transmitter and receiver was
just like on a like a user band in Bury

1072
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:19,890
just like on a like a user band in Bury
 

1073
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,000
just like on a like a user band in Bury
say we're only like three people in all

1074
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,010
say we're only like three people in all
 

1075
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,360
say we're only like three people in all
of the city use walkie talkies I think

1076
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,370
of the city use walkie talkies I think
 

1077
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,700
of the city use walkie talkies I think
it's not not ham radio right you guys

1078
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,710
it's not not ham radio right you guys
 

1079
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,820
it's not not ham radio right you guys
are the enough trust thing I mean well

1080
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:31,830
are the enough trust thing I mean well
 

1081
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,100
are the enough trust thing I mean well
even even walkie-talkies a ham radio

1082
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,110
even even walkie-talkies a ham radio
 

1083
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,370
even even walkie-talkies a ham radio
reads sort I mean no no they definitely

1084
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:37,380
reads sort I mean no no they definitely
 

1085
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,350
reads sort I mean no no they definitely
yeah because it depends on what

1086
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
yeah because it depends on what
 

1087
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,130
yeah because it depends on what
frequency they they can talk on right so

1088
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:43,140
frequency they they can talk on right so
 

1089
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,169
frequency they they can talk on right so
if you're on the 2 meter or what what's

1090
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:45,179
if you're on the 2 meter or what what's
