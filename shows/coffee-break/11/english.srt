201
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:48,380
yes the 5:00 a.m. presence yeah but he
sold it by Lots if he found lots of

202
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,390
sold it by Lots if he found lots of
 

203
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,410
sold it by Lots if he found lots of
pictures with cats with mice in their

Wow and what did he do use the Raspberry

208
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,220
Wow and what did he do use the Raspberry
 

209
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,740
Wow and what did he do use the Raspberry
Pi for that yes

210
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:12,750
Pi for that yes
 

211
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,230
Pi for that yes
okay because the Arduino wouldn't do

212
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
okay because the Arduino wouldn't do
 

213
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,900
okay because the Arduino wouldn't do
that I mean I don't think it's so it's

214
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:17,910
that I mean I don't think it's so it's
 

215
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,910
that I mean I don't think it's so it's
powerful enough to be able to do image

216
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:19,920
powerful enough to be able to do image
 

217
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,110
powerful enough to be able to do image
recognition mean like an end on you I

218
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,120
recognition mean like an end on you I
 

219
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,940
recognition mean like an end on you I
would think but hey if you do it with a

220
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:25,950
would think but hey if you do it with a
 

221
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:33,080
would think but hey if you do it with a

right so when you were talking about
 

253
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,830
right so when you were talking about
being able to use a ham radio through

254
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
being able to use a ham radio through
 

255
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,610

259
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,560
that's just like always like I want to
do it up like all steampunk because

260
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,570
do it up like all steampunk because
 

261
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,020
do it up like all steampunk because
that's just partials exactly that I

guess most people that have images of
 

265
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,300
guess most people that have images of
ham radio think about the old spark

266

have which is very very big which is bad
 

295
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,600
have which is very very big which is bad
for debris flow it is very big yeah so

296
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:45,610
for debris flow it is very big yeah so
 

297
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,100

yeah you transmit to the repeater on one
 

325
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:31,410
yeah you transmit to the repeater on one
frequency and it transmits right back

they had no way to talk so talk to each

396
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:13,850
they had no way to talk so talk to each
 

397
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,670
they had no way to talk so talk to each
other so we placed ham radio stations at

398
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:18,680
other so we placed ham radio stations at
 

399
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,550
other so we placed ham radio stations at
strategic places so that they would all

400
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:21,560
strategic places so that they would all
 

401
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,080
strategic places so that they would all
be able to talk to each and they could

402
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,090
be able to talk to each and they could
 

403
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,820
be able to talk to each and they could
coordinate getting supplies from one to

404
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:24,830
coordinate getting supplies from one to
 

405
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,270
coordinate getting supplies from one to
the other that way yeah I remember the

406
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,280
the other that way yeah I remember the
 

407
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,180
the other that way yeah I remember the
news said that they did that Hurricane

408
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,190

absolutely when Jeff and I were in radio

412
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:41,960
absolutely when Jeff and I were in radio

00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,640
absolutely when Jeff and I were in radio
we had repeaters for the radio station

414
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:44,650
we had repeaters for the radio station
 

415
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,320
we had repeaters for the radio station
right so I'm pretty familiar with how

416
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,330
right so I'm pretty familiar with how
 

417
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,630
right so I'm pretty familiar with how
that works because here we're regulated

418
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:49,640
that works because here we're regulated
 

419
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,080
that works because here we're regulated
by the CRTC so you can only have you can

420
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,090
by the CRTC so you can only have you can
 

421
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,060
by the CRTC so you can only have you can
only put out so much power from each

422
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,070
only put out so much power from each
 

423
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,150
only put out so much power from each
transmitter home right so if we wanted

424
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
transmitter home right so if we wanted
 

425
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,280
transmitter home right so if we wanted
to go if we wanted our radio station to

426
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,290
to go if we wanted our radio station to
 

427
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,560
to go if we wanted our radio station to
be able to be accessed you know an hour

428
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,570
be able to be accessed you know an hour
 

429
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,390
be able to be accessed you know an hour
north of here we'd have to put a

430
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,400
north of here we'd have to put a
 

431
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,050
north of here we'd have to put a
repeater station up there and and so it

432
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,060
repeater station up there and and so it
 

433
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,120
repeater station up there and and so it
would just work as a it would do exactly

434
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,130
would just work as a it would do exactly
 

435
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,710
would just work as a it would do exactly
what you're describing with the ham

436
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:11,720
what you're describing with the ham
 

437
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,810
what you're describing with the ham
radio it would capture the signal

438
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:13,820
radio it would capture the signal
 

439
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,460
radio it would capture the signal
through the airwaves and then

440
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,470
through the airwaves and then
 

441
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,290
through the airwaves and then
rebroadcast it locally on a different

442
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,300
rebroadcast it locally on a different
 

443
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,530
rebroadcast it locally on a different
frequency it's the same system with the

444
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:20,540
frequency it's the same system with the
 

445
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,730
frequency it's the same system with the
ham radio there is a limit of how much

446
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:24,740
ham radio there is a limit of how much
 

447
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:31,900

power the amplifiers can use now Robbie

448
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:31,910

you're talking about a commercial
 

451
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,420
you're talking about a commercial
station correct yeah I guess they were

452
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:37,430
station correct yeah I guess they were
 

453
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,270
station correct yeah I guess they were
they were half commercial half they were

454
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,280
they were half commercial half they were
 

455
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,970
they were half commercial half they were
a non-profit commercial station right

456
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:42,980
a non-profit commercial station right
 

457
