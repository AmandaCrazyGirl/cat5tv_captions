have you been looking at mine 64 score
I'm like is it bad I haven't looked at

316
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:12,620
I'm like is it bad I haven't looked at
 

317
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,430
I'm like is it bad I haven't looked at
the forum yet so far at the moment all

318
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
the forum yet so far at the moment all
 

319
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,150
the forum yet so far at the moment all
I've done is looked at the at the the

320
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,160
I've done is looked at the at the the
 

321
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I've done is looked at the at the the
documentation page the wiki as well as

322
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,170
documentation page the wiki as well as
 

323
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,110
documentation page the wiki as well as
all the various libraries that have been

324
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,120
all the various libraries that have been
 

325
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,900
all the various libraries that have been
that have implemented applications that

326
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:31,910
that have implemented applications that
 

327
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,590
that have implemented applications that
run on the pine time the it needs a

328
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
run on the pine time the it needs a
 

329
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,660
run on the pine time the it needs a
what's called a boot loader you get that

330
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:40,670
what's called a boot loader you get that
 

331
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,350
what's called a boot loader you get that
when you with the Arduino you use AVR

332
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,360
when you with the Arduino you use AVR
 

333
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,480
when you with the Arduino you use AVR
dude AV the UDP that is the bootloader

334
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,490
dude AV the UDP that is the bootloader
 

335
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,880
dude AV the UDP that is the bootloader
that that you have to run in order to

336
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:51,890
that that you have to run in order to
 

337
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,910
that that you have to run in order to
load a program into the Arduino and for

338
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:54,920
load a program into the Arduino and for
 

339
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,440
load a program into the Arduino and for
the point time it's a slightly different

340
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,450
the point time it's a slightly different
 

341
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,740
the point time it's a slightly different
I believe it's OCR something I've

342
00:09:59,740 --> 00:09:59,750
I believe it's OCR something I've
 

343
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,890
I believe it's OCR something I've
forgotten the name of it but you don't

344
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:02,900
forgotten the name of it but you don't
 

345
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,220
forgotten the name of it but you don't
just load so we talked about a couple of

346
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,230
just load so we talked about a couple of
 

347
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,010
just load so we talked about a couple of
days ago you talked about PHP as your

348
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,020
days ago you talked about PHP as your
 

349
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,000
days ago you talked about PHP as your
main language right yeah I'd say that's

350
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,010
main language right yeah I'd say that's
 

351
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,300
main language right yeah I'd say that's
probably my strongest language what

352
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,310
probably my strongest language what
 

353
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,670
probably my strongest language what
languages do you see the thing about PHP

354
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:18,680
languages do you see the thing about PHP
 

355
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,370
languages do you see the thing about PHP
is it's not compiled it's a scripting

356
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,380
is it's not compiled it's a scripting
 

357
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,590
is it's not compiled it's a scripting
language it's interpreted directly by

358
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
language it's interpreted directly by
 

359
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,530
language it's interpreted directly by
the browser or run the PHP plug-in on

360
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:26,540
the browser or run the PHP plug-in on
 

361
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,490
the browser or run the PHP plug-in on
the browser to to Bologna the PHP

362
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,500
the browser to to Bologna the PHP
 

363
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,220
the browser to to Bologna the PHP
environment correct in order to display

364
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,230
environment correct in order to display
 

365
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,040
environment correct in order to display
data on your page now you can insert

366
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,050
data on your page now you can insert
 

367
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,590
data on your page now you can insert
things like SQL queries or whatever it

368
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:38,600
things like SQL queries or whatever it
 

369
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,450
things like SQL queries or whatever it
is you have to do and then make it

370
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,460
is you have to do and then make it
 

371
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,520
is you have to do and then make it
display stuff based on that but that's

372
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:42,530
display stuff based on that but that's
 

373
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,000
display stuff based on that but that's
all happening interactively scripted

374
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,010
all happening interactively scripted
 

375
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,330
all happening interactively scripted
right the difference is that the sort of

376
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:49,340
right the difference is that the sort of
 

377
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,060
right the difference is that the sort of
programming that under enrich C or C

378
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,070
programming that under enrich C or C
 

379
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,370
programming that under enrich C or C
sharp or rust or whatever need whatever

380
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:54,380
sharp or rust or whatever need whatever
 

381
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,190
sharp or rust or whatever need whatever
they're using is that the source code

382
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
they're using is that the source code
 

383
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,520
they're using is that the source code
gets compiled into a binary executable

384
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,530
gets compiled into a binary executable
 

385
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,700
gets compiled into a binary executable
that gets dumped on to the watch yeah

386
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:03,710
that gets dumped on to the watch yeah
 

387
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,560
that gets dumped on to the watch yeah
and the

388
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,570
and the
 

389
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,690
and the
so that's the difference I can take all

390
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:07,700
so that's the difference I can take all
 

391
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,910
so that's the difference I can take all
the time I need to do the compile I

392
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
the time I need to do the compile I
 

393
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,500
the time I need to do the compile I
don't care how long the compile takes

394
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,510
don't care how long the compile takes
 

395
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,080
don't care how long the compile takes
what I want is to make sure that once

396
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,090
what I want is to make sure that once
 

397
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,640
what I want is to make sure that once
it's on the watch that it runs

398
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:15,650
it's on the watch that it runs
 

399
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:24,970
it's on the watch that it runs
efficiently or that it runs at all maybe

400
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:24,980
efficiently or that it runs at all maybe
 

401
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,650
efficiently or that it runs at all maybe
change your ordering there to your

402
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:26,660
change your ordering there to your
 

403
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,720
change your ordering there to your
priorities make sure it runs all and

404
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:28,730
priorities make sure it runs all and
 

405
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,630
priorities make sure it runs all and
then make sure it runs the fish right

406
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
then make sure it runs the fish right
 

407
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,310
then make sure it runs the fish right
that's always how I work you know always

408
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,320
that's always how I work you know always
 

409
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,740
that's always how I work you know always
make it work first and then if I have

410
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:35,750
make it work first and then if I have
 

411
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,880
make it work first and then if I have
any performance issues with the program

412
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:39,890
any performance issues with the program
 

413
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,890
any performance issues with the program
at that point then go do something about

414
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:41,900
at that point then go do something about
 

415
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,830
at that point then go do something about
about it then about those performance

416
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:44,840
about it then about those performance
 

417
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,540
about it then about those performance
issues that's always the way I approach

418
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:46,550
issues that's always the way I approach
 

419
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,180
issues that's always the way I approach
it in any case so yeah I've been

420
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,190
it in any case so yeah I've been
 

421
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,830
it in any case so yeah I've been
studying up on those figuring out how to

422
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:50,840
studying up on those figuring out how to
 

423
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,800
studying up on those figuring out how to
draw a watch face in with with vectors

424
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,810
draw a watch face in with with vectors
 

425
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,200
draw a watch face in with with vectors
instead of as a as a graphical PNG I

426
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,210
instead of as a as a graphical PNG I
 

427
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,330
instead of as a as a graphical PNG I
think I understand now why they use that

428
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,340
think I understand now why they use that
 

429
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,150
think I understand now why they use that
graphical PNG because most of the stuff

430
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,160
graphical PNG because most of the stuff
 

431
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,760
graphical PNG because most of the stuff
what's it what did you find about that

432
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:09,770
what's it what did you find about that
 

433
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,180
what's it what did you find about that
because that was a curiosity for sure

434
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,190
because that was a curiosity for sure
 

435
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,430
because that was a curiosity for sure
it's easy to do as I say though what you

436
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
it's easy to do as I say though what you
 

437
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,130
it's easy to do as I say though what you
do is you have to take that PNG once

438
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,140
do is you have to take that PNG once
 

439
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,870
do is you have to take that PNG once
you've decided how you want the watch

440
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:19,880
you've decided how you want the watch
 

441
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,100
you've decided how you want the watch
face to look you take that PNG and you

442
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,110
face to look you take that PNG and you
 

443
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,530
face to look you take that PNG and you
can you convert that and they've got

444
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:26,540
can you convert that and they've got
 

445
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,690
can you convert that and they've got
tools to help you do that they convert

446
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:28,700
tools to help you do that they convert
 

447
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,330
tools to help you do that they convert
that into a header file that basically

448
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,340
that into a header file that basically
 

449
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,640
that into a header file that basically
just declares an array of a whole bunch

450
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:33,650
just declares an array of a whole bunch
 

451
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,810
just declares an array of a whole bunch
of numbers whole bunch of hex values

452
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:36,820
of numbers whole bunch of hex values
 

453
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,510
of numbers whole bunch of hex values
those hex values describe the RGB values

454
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:40,520
those hex values describe the RGB values
 

455
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,930
those hex values describe the RGB values
of each pixel in that in that in that

456
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:46,940
of each pixel in that in that in that
 

457
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,120
of each pixel in that in that in that
picture and so a 320 by 320 or a 240 by

458
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,130
picture and so a 320 by 320 or a 240 by
 

459
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,310
picture and so a 320 by 320 or a 240 by
240 I'm still not sure what the actual

460
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
240 I'm still not sure what the actual
 

461
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,820
240 I'm still not sure what the actual
resolution of the pone time is and I

462
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:57,830
resolution of the pone time is and I
 

463
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,350
resolution of the pone time is and I
won't know that till actually get the

464
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
won't know that till actually get the
 

465
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,830
won't know that till actually get the
device some say 240 by 240 some say 320

466
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:02,840
device some say 240 by 240 some say 320
 

467
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,260
device some say 240 by 240 some say 320
by 320 but once you've converted that

468
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,270
by 320 but once you've converted that
 

469
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,010
by 320 but once you've converted that
image into that array of values you can

470
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,020
image into that array of values you can
 

471
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,650
image into that array of values you can
just split that up on the screen and I

472
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:14,660
just split that up on the screen and I
 

473
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,350
just split that up on the screen and I
think the reason that a

474
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,360
think the reason that a
 

475
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,410
think the reason that a
programmers do it that way so that when

476
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,420
programmers do it that way so that when
 

477
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,290
programmers do it that way so that when
you draw the hands that change every

478
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:24,300
you draw the hands that change every
 

479
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:31,400
you draw the hands that change every
second on the watch face especially when

480
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,410
second on the watch face especially when
 

481
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,199
second on the watch face especially when
you clear the you know when you clear

482
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:36,209
you clear the you know when you clear
 

483
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,300
you clear the you know when you clear
the second hand from one location and

484
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,310
the second hand from one location and
 

485
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,840
the second hand from one location and
draw it on the next location I think

486
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:41,850
draw it on the next location I think
 

487
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,280
draw it on the next location I think
with a PNG that you won't destroy any of

488
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,290
with a PNG that you won't destroy any of
 

489
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,280
with a PNG that you won't destroy any of
the pixels behind it but with victor

490
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,290
the pixels behind it but with victor
 

491
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,170
the pixels behind it but with victor
mode when you program it as a vector

492
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,180
mode when you program it as a vector
 

493
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,480
mode when you program it as a vector
where is where you say from the center

494
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,490
where is where you say from the center
 

495
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,170
where is where you say from the center
of the circle the watch face to the

496
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:57,180
of the circle the watch face to the
 

497
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,110
of the circle the watch face to the
number one digit or whatever when you

498
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,120
number one digit or whatever when you
 

499
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,470
number one digit or whatever when you
draw that then clear it and then draw

500
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:03,480
draw that then clear it and then draw
 

501
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,650
draw that then clear it and then draw
the next one what you cleared will

502
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:06,660
the next one what you cleared will
 

503
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,000
the next one what you cleared will
you'll end up with a whole bunch of

504
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,010
you'll end up with a whole bunch of
 

505
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,009
you'll end up with a whole bunch of
unset pixels and so you will have

506
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:10,019
unset pixels and so you will have
 

507
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,540
unset pixels and so you will have
destroyed anything or messed up anything

508
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:14,550
destroyed anything or messed up anything
 

509

that was drawn underneath this so I

510
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
that was drawn underneath this so I
 

511
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,410
that was drawn underneath this so I
guess that would affect if you had like

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:18,420
guess that would affect if you had like
 

513
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,519
guess that would affect if you had like
say like a wallpaper under watch face

514
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:21,529
say like a wallpaper under watch face
 

515
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,610

well I think again this is pure

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:25,620
well I think again this is pure

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,639
well I think again this is pure
conjecture I think that with the PNG or

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:28,649
conjecture I think that with the PNG or
 

519
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:32,000
conjecture I think that with the PNG or

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,010
with a wallpaper that does not happen so

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,769
with a wallpaper that does not happen so
you don't have to worry about resetting

522
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:33,779
you don't have to worry about resetting
 

523
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,600
you don't have to worry about resetting
those pixels back to the way they were

524
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:35,610
those pixels back to the way they were
 

525
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,569
those pixels back to the way they were
before you destroyed them by drawing a

00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,740
before you destroyed them by drawing a
line over them with everything when are

I mean I think it's coming from China I

538
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:57,269
I mean I think it's coming from China I
 

539
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,780
I mean I think it's coming from China I
don't know I don't know if there's any

00:14:59,780 --> 00:14:59,790
don't know I don't know if there's any
 

541
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,780
don't know I don't know if there's any
any phone watches here locally when you

542
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:02,790
any phone watches here locally when you

any phone watches here locally when you
order from point sixty four I think it

544
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:04,440
order from point sixty four I think it
 

545
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,800
order from point sixty four I think it
comes from there so

546
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:10,810

 

547
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:17,920

and the other both just to see what

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,400
and the other both just to see what
happens

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,410
happens
 

551
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,980
happens
sure I'm gonna try both approaches but

552
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:20,990
sure I'm gonna try both approaches but
 

553
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,350
sure I'm gonna try both approaches but
there's there are already plenty of

there's there are already plenty of
 

555
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,520
there's there are already plenty of

00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,250
what I would rather have is a much
cleaner watch face that is really just

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,260
cleaner watch face that is really just

cleaner watch face that is really just
each of the tick marks for each minute

each of the tick marks for each minute
 

581
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,000
each of the tick marks for each minute
and then each of the arms just move as

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,010
and then each of the arms just move as
 

583
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,850

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,950

days ago you were thinking probably an

588
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:23,960
days ago you were thinking probably an
 

589
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,480
days ago you were thinking probably an
analog movement where it would look

590
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,490
analog movement where it would look
 

591
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,870
analog movement where it would look
continuous but I don't believe it would

592
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
continuous but I don't believe it would
 

593
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,490
continuous but I don't believe it would
be nice but I don't think it would be

594
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:30,500
be nice but I don't think it would be
 

595
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,590
be nice but I don't think it would be
smart because it would use up a lot of

596
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:32,600
smart because it would use up a lot of
 

597
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,400
smart because it would use up a lot of
CPU just to keep updating that and

598
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,410
CPU just to keep updating that and
 

599
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,430
CPU just to keep updating that and
whereas if you if you trigger it every

600
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
whereas if you if you trigger it every
 

601
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,260
whereas if you if you trigger it every
second it can run off an interrupt that

602
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,270
second it can run off an interrupt that
 

603
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,110
second it can run off an interrupt that
runs every second and when it triggers

604
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,120
runs every second and when it triggers
 

605
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,010
runs every second and when it triggers
off an interrupt

606
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,020
off an interrupt
 

607
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,680
off an interrupt
then all you then you only use CPU time

608
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:47,690
then all you then you only use CPU time
 

609
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,620
then all you then you only use CPU time
when it when it has to update for that

00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:58,520
exactly right yep yep so that's what I'm

exactly right yep yep so that's what I'm
looking at kinda like season 1 of

looking at kinda like season 1 of

00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:07,720
looking at kinda like season 1 of
category 5 but my point we've got a

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:07,730
category 5 but my point we've got a
 

619
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,360
category 5 but my point we've got a
start somewhere and I'm pretty sure I'm

620
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,370
start somewhere and I'm pretty sure I'm
 

621
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,190
start somewhere and I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna have to rely on libraries to do

00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:12,200
gonna have to rely on libraries to do
 

623
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,949
gonna have to rely on libraries to do
this I only want to use libraries where

624
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
this I only want to use libraries where
 

625
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,699
this I only want to use libraries where
I have the source code some there's a

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:17,709
I have the source code some there's a
 

627
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,760
I have the source code some there's a
display driver that Adafruit publishes I

628
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:21,770
display driver that Adafruit publishes I
 

629
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,020
display driver that Adafruit publishes I
don't know if you've heard of Adafruit

630
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,030
don't know if you've heard of Adafruit
 

631
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,769
don't know if you've heard of Adafruit
they're even

632
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:23,779
they're even
 

633
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,559
they're even
you know of course yes and so when I

634
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:26,569
you know of course yes and so when I
 

635
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,719
you know of course yes and so when I
bought lots of stuff from them I put a

636
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:28,729
bought lots of stuff from them I put a
 

637
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:31,330
bought lots of stuff from them I put a
lot of Aquino's and kids and all kinds

638
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:31,340
lot of Aquino's and kids and all kinds
 

639
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,109
lot of Aquino's and kids and all kinds
of stuff from them so I don't mind using

640
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:35,119
of stuff from them so I don't mind using
 

641
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,599
of stuff from them so I don't mind using
their open-source libraries and any of

642
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:37,609
their open-source libraries and any of
 

643
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:40,570
their open-source libraries and any of
this if they don't if their library

644
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:40,580
this if they don't if their library
 

645
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,539
this if they don't if their library
works then it's just a matter of

646
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:43,549
works then it's just a matter of
 

647
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,209
works then it's just a matter of
compiling it right into my own

648
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:46,219
compiling it right into my own
 

649
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,099
compiling it right into my own
application that just becomes the same

650
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,109
application that just becomes the same
 

651
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,409
application that just becomes the same
as binary blog that would be the ideal

652
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:50,419
as binary blog that would be the ideal
 

653
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:54,729
as binary blog that would be the ideal
thing I remember I think they showed it

654
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:54,739
thing I remember I think they showed it
 

655
00:17:54,739 --> 00:18:02,739
thing I remember I think they showed it
on a video some years ago but it was one

656
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:02,749
on a video some years ago but it was one
 

657
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,899
on a video some years ago but it was one
of the first smartwatches that came

658
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:04,909
of the first smartwatches that came
 

659
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:11,759
of the first smartwatches that came
around and someone managed to put a

660
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:11,769
around and someone managed to put a
 

661
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:14,379
around and someone managed to put a
virtualized in an environment on it and

662
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:14,389
virtualized in an environment on it and
 

663
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:17,320
virtualized in an environment on it and
they just to see what happens they

664
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,330
they just to see what happens they
 

665
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,209
they just to see what happens they

666
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:21,219
installed Windows 95 on it's

671
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:36,369

take up the entire screen yeah he

672
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:36,379
take up the entire screen yeah he
 

673
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:39,639
take up the entire screen yeah he
managed to dismiss it down but yeah he

674
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:39,649
managed to dismiss it down but yeah he
 

675
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:40,959
managed to dismiss it down but yeah he
only did it just to see see what

00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:40,969
only did it just to see see what
 

677
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:45,129

most useless implementation of putting
 

681
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:55,690
most useless implementation of putting
stuff on things was someone installed a

back when Slackware and all was around
there was a very small Linux

690
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:20,059
there was a very small Linux
 

691
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,039
there was a very small Linux
distribution that booted off a 3.5 inch

692
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:24,049
distribution that booted off a 3.5 inch
 

693

floppy disk it the initials were DSL you

694
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,210
floppy disk it the initials were DSL you
 

695
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,629
floppy disk it the initials were DSL you
remember that yeah we've said

696
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:37,639
remember that yeah we've said
 

697
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:40,319
remember that yeah we've said
hell on the show so far so now I can

698
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:40,329
hell on the show so far so now I can
 

699
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:46,509
hell on the show so far so now I can
dance more Linux then that's okay but

700
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:46,519
dance more Linux then that's okay but
 

701
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,259
dance more Linux then that's okay but
that booted up fairly quickly I mean it

702
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:50,269
that booted up fairly quickly I mean it
 

703
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,019
that booted up fairly quickly I mean it
was slow because the floppy disks were

704
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:53,029
was slow because the floppy disks were
 

705
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:56,529
was slow because the floppy disks were
very slow yeah it just took time to seek

706
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:56,539
very slow yeah it just took time to seek
 

707
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,709
very slow yeah it just took time to seek
two tracks on on the floppy but hey hey

708
00:19:59,709 --> 00:19:59,719
two tracks on on the floppy but hey hey
 

709
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,310
two tracks on on the floppy but hey hey
it worked

710
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
it worked
 

711
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,979
it worked
you couldn't do much with it but if you

712
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:02,989
you couldn't do much with it but if you
 

713
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:06,459
you couldn't do much with it but if you
desperately needed to if you hosed up

714
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:06,469
desperately needed to if you hosed up
 

715
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:09,669
desperately needed to if you hosed up
your hard drive and you needed to get to

716
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
your hard drive and you needed to get to
 

717
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,489
your hard drive and you needed to get to
the hard drive you'd fire up this DSL

718
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:12,499
the hard drive you'd fire up this DSL
 

719
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,159
the hard drive you'd fire up this DSL
distro melt the hard drive is another

720
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:15,169
distro melt the hard drive is another
 

721
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,409
distro melt the hard drive is another
that's a lock onto another mount point

722
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:17,419
that's a lock onto another mount point
 

723
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:19,749
that's a lock onto another mount point
do whatever surgery you needed to do

724
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:19,759
do whatever surgery you needed to do
 

725
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,940
do whatever surgery you needed to do
then you could just reboot the thing off

726
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:21,950
then you could just reboot the thing off
 

727
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,999
then you could just reboot the thing off
the hard drive again or would be used to

728
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:28,009
the hard drive again or would be used to
 

729
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:33,849
the hard drive again or would be used to
think that it's DSL because it was

730
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:33,859
think that it's DSL because it was
 

731
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,759
think that it's DSL because it was
primarily used for a DSL connections

732
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:36,769
primarily used for a DSL connections
 

733
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,209
primarily used for a DSL connections
until I actually see the homepage I'm

734
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:40,219
until I actually see the homepage I'm
 

735
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:42,519
until I actually see the homepage I'm
gonna be using to yourself a dial-up I

736
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:42,529
gonna be using to yourself a dial-up I
 

737
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:46,479
gonna be using to yourself a dial-up I
believe that was what we did I use damn

738
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:46,489
believe that was what we did I use damn
 

739
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,579
believe that was what we did I use damn
smart Linux for dialing yes I think so

740
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:48,589
smart Linux for dialing yes I think so
 

741
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:52,299
smart Linux for dialing yes I think so
yeah I what would happen was that this

742
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:52,309
yeah I what would happen was that this
 

743
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:56,289
yeah I what would happen was that this
was at my ex-father-in-law place and so

744
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:56,299
was at my ex-father-in-law place and so
 

745
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,409
was at my ex-father-in-law place and so
what we did is we set up a PC that just

746
00:20:59,409 --> 00:20:59,419
what we did is we set up a PC that just
 

747
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:03,759
what we did is we set up a PC that just
booted off the floppy and whenever

748
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:03,769
booted off the floppy and whenever
 

749
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:05,799
booted off the floppy and whenever
somebody needed anyone on the network

750
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:05,809
somebody needed anyone on the network
 

751
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:08,139
somebody needed anyone on the network
needed to get on the internet it would

752
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:08,149
needed to get on the internet it would
 

753
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:14,109
needed to get on the internet it would
on demand set up the PPP connection by

754
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:14,119
on demand set up the PPP connection by
 

755
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,769
on demand set up the PPP connection by
dialing up the internet service provider

756
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:17,779
dialing up the internet service provider
 

757
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,619
dialing up the internet service provider
setting up the PPP connection getting at

758
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:20,629
setting up the PPP connection getting at
 

759
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:22,690
setting up the PPP connection getting at
IP address and then yep there we go and

760
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:22,700
IP address and then yep there we go and
 

761
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,690
IP address and then yep there we go and
we already know how to be net so well it

762
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:25,700
we already know how to be net so well it
 

763
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,239
we already know how to be net so well it
just works I thought it was the most

764
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:28,249
just works I thought it was the most
 

765
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:30,819
just works I thought it was the most
amazing thing in the whole wide world a

766
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:30,829
amazing thing in the whole wide world a
 

767
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:35,139
amazing thing in the whole wide world a
friend of mine the same had a big array

768
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:35,149
friend of mine the same had a big array
 

769
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:40,419
friend of mine the same had a big array
that fell down I introduced him to a

770
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:40,429
that fell down I introduced him to a
 

771
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,849
that fell down I introduced him to a
Linux by I sent him a CD of their

772
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:44,859
Linux by I sent him a CD of their
 

773
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:49,059
Linux by I sent him a CD of their
Caldera 1.2 and he was so sawing in he

774
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:49,069
Caldera 1.2 and he was so sawing in he
 

775
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:51,110
Caldera 1.2 and he was so sawing in he
he liked it so much that he here

776
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
he liked it so much that he here
 

777
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,790
he liked it so much that he here
managed to get his he managed to get his

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,110
yes he managed to install less them to
 

781
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,020
yes he managed to install less them to
