what I had to do was to figure out what

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
what I had to do was to figure out what
 

255
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,659
what I had to do was to figure out what
the XY coordinates of each of those tick

256
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:27,669
the XY coordinates of each of those tick
 

257
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,659
the XY coordinates of each of those tick
marks we're going to be and I don't know

258
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:30,669
marks we're going to be and I don't know
 

259
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,550
marks we're going to be and I don't know
if you saw on the image but the 12

260
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
if you saw on the image but the 12
 

261
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,399
if you saw on the image but the 12
o'clock 3 o'clock 6 o'clock and 9

262
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:35,409
o'clock 3 o'clock 6 o'clock and 9
 

263
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,480
o'clock 3 o'clock 6 o'clock and 9
o'clock tick marks were extra-large the

264
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,490
o'clock tick marks were extra-large the
 

265
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,630
o'clock tick marks were extra-large the
1 o'clock 2 o'clock and each of the 5

266
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
1 o'clock 2 o'clock and each of the 5
 

267
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,060
1 o'clock 2 o'clock and each of the 5
minute tick marks were slightly smaller

268
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,070
minute tick marks were slightly smaller
 

269
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,850
minute tick marks were slightly smaller
and then each of the individual minute

270
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:47,860
and then each of the individual minute
 

271
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,300
and then each of the individual minute
mark

272
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,310
mark
 

273
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,820
mark
we're even smaller still so I had to

274
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:50,830
we're even smaller still so I had to
 

275
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,269
we're even smaller still so I had to
figure out budget on a 320 by 320

276
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:54,279
figure out budget on a 320 by 320
 

277
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,800
figure out budget on a 320 by 320
display I had to say okay we do each of

278
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:58,810
display I had to say okay we do each of
 

279
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,750
display I had to say okay we do each of
these tick marks begin and end what are

280
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:00,760
these tick marks begin and end what are
 

281
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,580
these tick marks begin and end what are
the XY coordinates for each of these

282
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:02,590
the XY coordinates for each of these
 

283
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,100
the XY coordinates for each of these
tick marks from one end of the line to

284
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,110
tick marks from one end of the line to
 

285
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,860
tick marks from one end of the line to
the other end of the line and so I feel

286
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:07,870
the other end of the line and so I feel
 

287
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,380
the other end of the line and so I feel
like each time which is what this

288
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,390
like each time which is what this
 

289
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,230
like each time which is what this
program does that's but the end of it

290
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,240
program does that's but the end of it
 

291
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,590
program does that's but the end of it
the end result is that all I have to do

292
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:16,600
the end result is that all I have to do
 

293
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,970
the end result is that all I have to do
is we can extract the XY coordinates of

294
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:20,980
is we can extract the XY coordinates of
 

295
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,700
is we can extract the XY coordinates of
each of those tick marks all I have to

296
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:23,710
each of those tick marks all I have to
 

297
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,040
each of those tick marks all I have to
do is extract out the XY coordinates of

298
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,050
do is extract out the XY coordinates of
 

299
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,590
do is extract out the XY coordinates of
those tick marks and then put them in an

300
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
those tick marks and then put them in an
 

301
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,540
those tick marks and then put them in an
array and then the program on the

302
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,550
array and then the program on the
 

303
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,970
array and then the program on the
pointer just draws what the array says

304
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:32,980
pointer just draws what the array says
 

305
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,780
pointer just draws what the array says
to draw are you documenting this process

306
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:38,790
to draw are you documenting this process
 

307
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,160

other developers are probably going to

310
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:45,520
other developers are probably going to
 

311
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,269
other developers are probably going to

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,400

that's what this program is that I can

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,410
that's what this program is that I can
 

331
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,970
that's what this program is that I can
even make the program print a out to a

even make the program print a out to a
 

333
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,120
even make the program print a out to a

yesterday's coffee break vp9 you you had
 

347
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,740
yesterday's coffee break vp9 you you had
kind of let on that you were starting to

348
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:58,750
kind of let on that you were starting to
 

349
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,269
kind of let on that you were starting to
lean toward the ping and now

350
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:00,279
lean toward the ping and now
 

351
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,040
lean toward the ping and now
working back on the vector is there a

352
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,050
working back on the vector is there a
 

353
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,610
working back on the vector is there a
reason that you decided I was thinking I

354
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:05,620
reason that you decided I was thinking I
 

355
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,160
reason that you decided I was thinking I
understand it at least yeah I think I

356
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,170
understand it at least yeah I think I
 

357
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,989
understand it at least yeah I think I
was thinking about that last night or

358
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:09,999
was thinking about that last night or
 

359
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,480
was thinking about that last night or
yesterday afternoon when we talked after

360
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,490
yesterday afternoon when we talked after
 

361
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,650
yesterday afternoon when we talked after
we talked about it

362
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:13,660
we talked about it
 

363
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,150
we talked about it
I saw the description on the video I

364
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,160
I saw the description on the video I
 

365
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,619
I saw the description on the video I
didn't I did not want to give the

366
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:19,629
didn't I did not want to give the
 

367
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,590
didn't I did not want to give the
impression that I felt like the PNG was

368
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,600
impression that I felt like the PNG was
 

369
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,900
impression that I felt like the PNG was
the better approach I'm still sticking

370
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:24,910
the better approach I'm still sticking
 

371
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,569
the better approach I'm still sticking
with the vector approach someone else on

372
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:27,579
with the vector approach someone else on
 

373
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,610
with the vector approach someone else on
the on the call asked me if I was going

374
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:29,620
the on the call asked me if I was going
 

375
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,949
the on the call asked me if I was going
to do both and I said yeah absolutely

376
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:31,959
to do both and I said yeah absolutely
 

377
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,780
to do both and I said yeah absolutely
if only just to understand how they work

378
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:35,790
if only just to understand how they work
 

379
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,239
if only just to understand how they work
that's the that's the point I want to be

380
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:39,249
that's the that's the point I want to be
 

381
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,759
that's the that's the point I want to be
able to understand how they work with

382
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:41,769
able to understand how they work with
 

383
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,410
able to understand how they work with
which whichever one I end up using

384
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:43,420
which whichever one I end up using
 

385
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,470
which whichever one I end up using
ultimately is likely going to be the

386
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
ultimately is likely going to be the
 

387
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,329
ultimately is likely going to be the
vector one because I like the nice

388
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:48,339
vector one because I like the nice
 

389
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,970
vector one because I like the nice
simple display and I think I've already

390
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:50,980
simple display and I think I've already
 

391
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,619
simple display and I think I've already
figured I think I figured out now how I

392
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:52,629
figured I think I figured out now how I
 

393
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,160
figured I think I figured out now how I
want to update the watch face each time

394
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,170
want to update the watch face each time
 

395
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,860
want to update the watch face each time
the minute hand or the second hand takes

396
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:58,870
the minute hand or the second hand takes
 

397
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,449
the minute hand or the second hand takes
over I think that what I can do is to

398
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:02,459
over I think that what I can do is to
 

399
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,220
over I think that what I can do is to
erase the second hand at its current

400
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,230
erase the second hand at its current
 

401
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,189
erase the second hand at its current
position then redraw the entire watch

402
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:08,199
position then redraw the entire watch
 

403
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,189
position then redraw the entire watch
face because it out very quick because I

404
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:11,199
face because it out very quick because I
 

405
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,990
face because it out very quick because I
can do that because it's all vector

406
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,000
can do that because it's all vector
 

407
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,069
can do that because it's all vector
based and then just draw the new draw

408
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,079
based and then just draw the new draw
 

409
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,129
based and then just draw the new draw
the new second hand in the new position

410
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:20,139
the new second hand in the new position
 

411
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,639
the new second hand in the new position
and I think that will work quite quite

412
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:23,649
and I think that will work quite quite
 

413
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:27,299
and I think that will work quite quite
well because the CPU in that pond time

414
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:27,309
well because the CPU in that pond time
 

415
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:31,679
well because the CPU in that pond time
runs quite fast I want to say 600 Meg

416
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:31,689
runs quite fast I want to say 600 Meg
 

417
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:32,999
runs quite fast I want to say 600 Meg
but I don't think that's right I think

418
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:33,009
but I don't think that's right I think
 

419
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,759
but I don't think that's right I think
it's I think it's probably 60 or

420
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:35,769
it's I think it's probably 60 or
 

421
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:38,490
it's I think it's probably 60 or
something like there's any case Palicki

422
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:38,500
something like there's any case Palicki
 

423
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,730
something like there's any case Palicki
for attacks mm right yeah just a

424
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:41,740
for attacks mm right yeah just a
 

425
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,460
for attacks mm right yeah just a
cortex-m processor so yeah can see the

426
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:44,470
cortex-m processor so yeah can see the
 

427
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,699
cortex-m processor so yeah can see the
inflate-a-pack and the thing is that the

428
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:47,709
inflate-a-pack and the thing is that the
 

429
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,230
inflate-a-pack and the thing is that the
faster runs of course the Mojito

430
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,240
faster runs of course the Mojito
 

431
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,119
faster runs of course the Mojito
generates the more power it uses so you

432
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:51,129
generates the more power it uses so you
 

433
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,730
generates the more power it uses so you
don't want it to run too fast

434
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:52,740
don't want it to run too fast
 

435
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,989
don't want it to run too fast
and while CPU is one part of it the be

436
00:12:59,989 --> 00:12:59,999
and while CPU is one part of it the be
 

437
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,999
and while CPU is one part of it the be
how fast you can update the display is

438
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:03,009
how fast you can update the display is
 

439
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:06,179
how fast you can update the display is
another part of it so we'll have to see

440
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:06,189
another part of it so we'll have to see
 

441
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,970
another part of it so we'll have to see
how fast the display responds I

442
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:08,980
how fast the display responds I
 

443
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,699
how fast the display responds I
definitely do not want to clear the

444
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:11,709
definitely do not want to clear the
 

445
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,050
definitely do not want to clear the
display between each update

446
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,060
display between each update
 

447
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,270
display between each update
what I want to do is as I said wherever

448
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,280
what I want to do is as I said wherever
 

449
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,000
what I want to do is as I said wherever
the second hand is now erase it so all I

450
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,010
the second hand is now erase it so all I
 

451
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,790
the second hand is now erase it so all I
have is just that line that has yeah

452
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:21,800
have is just that line that has yeah
 

453
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,340
have is just that line that has yeah
okay I miss anything wrong

454
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,350
okay I miss anything wrong
 

455
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,740
okay I miss anything wrong
yeah then redraw the whole clock face

456
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:26,750
yeah then redraw the whole clock face
 

457
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,900
yeah then redraw the whole clock face
which will just restore that one line

458
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:28,910
which will just restore that one line
 

459
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,060
which will just restore that one line
but I don't have to worry about what if

460
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,070
but I don't have to worry about what if
 

461
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,260
but I don't have to worry about what if
I

462
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,270
I
 

463
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,320
I
drawing that that or leaving that second

464
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,330
drawing that that or leaving that second
 

465
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,570
drawing that that or leaving that second
hand in the old location it should just

466
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:37,580
hand in the old location it should just
 

467
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,970
hand in the old location it should just
restore those bits that were that were

468
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:39,980
restore those bits that were that were
 

469
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,640
restore those bits that were that were
wiped out then draw the new second hand

470
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:42,650
wiped out then draw the new second hand
 

471
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,880
wiped out then draw the new second hand
at that point so it should be a very

472
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:45,890
at that point so it should be a very
 

473
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,040
at that point so it should be a very
minimal effect on the display I'm hoping

474
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,050
minimal effect on the display I'm hoping
 

475
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,430
minimal effect on the display I'm hoping
I'd like to see the refresh rate and see

476
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
I'd like to see the refresh rate and see
 

477
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,920
I'd like to see the refresh rate and see
if it looks like it slashes or if it's

478
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:53,930
if it looks like it slashes or if it's
 

479
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,500
if it looks like it slashes or if it's
exactly yeah and that's why I don't want

480
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:56,510
exactly yeah and that's why I don't want
 

481
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,720
exactly yeah and that's why I don't want
to erase the display each time because I

482
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:58,730
to erase the display each time because I
 

483
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,400
to erase the display each time because I
know that's going to be very noticeable

484
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,410
know that's going to be very noticeable
 

485
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,580
know that's going to be very noticeable
for sure but if all I do is wipe out the

486
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:03,590
for sure but if all I do is wipe out the
 

487
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,280
for sure but if all I do is wipe out the
old redraw and that will just refresh

488
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,290
old redraw and that will just refresh
 

489
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,610
old redraw and that will just refresh
what was wiped out then draw the new

490
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:09,620
what was wiped out then draw the new
 

491
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,350
what was wiped out then draw the new
second hand I think that'll be the most

492
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
second hand I think that'll be the most
 

493
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,780
second hand I think that'll be the most
efficient approach we go beyond what

494
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:13,790
efficient approach we go beyond what
 

495
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,640
efficient approach we go beyond what
they did a second you your brain don't

496
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:15,650
they did a second you your brain don't
 

497
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,150
they did a second you your brain don't
notice it if they did that that good

498
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,160
notice it if they did that that good
 

499
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,610
notice it if they did that that good
early days of wonders of the second you

500
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:24,620
early days of wonders of the second you
 

501
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,720
early days of wonders of the second you
won't notice that brave didn't change

502
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:27,730
won't notice that brave didn't change
 

503
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,960
won't notice that brave didn't change
because yeah I just don't know what the

504
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:31,970
because yeah I just don't know what the
 

505
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,260
because yeah I just don't know what the
refresh rate of the screen is so I'm I

506
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,270
refresh rate of the screen is so I'm I
 

507
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,450
refresh rate of the screen is so I'm I
think it's fast enough I'd obviously

508
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,460
think it's fast enough I'd obviously
 

509
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,470
think it's fast enough I'd obviously
don't know but I can certainly get the

510
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:41,480
don't know but I can certainly get the
 

511
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,600
don't know but I can certainly get the
display yeah ultimate that all the

512
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,610
display yeah ultimate that all the
 

513
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,470
display yeah ultimate that all the
elements of the display in place and

514
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,480
elements of the display in place and
 

515
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,500
elements of the display in place and
then see what happens

516
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,510
then see what happens
 

517
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,940
then see what happens
I can't wait what's the worst could

518
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:51,950
I can't wait what's the worst could
 

519
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,710
I can't wait what's the worst could
happen right I want to I want to say hi

520
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:53,720

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,130
we've got Peter in two places today it's

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,630
we've got Peter in two places today it's
got two webcams right on the bottom

finding out of it like an ETA for us

544
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,490
finding out of it like an ETA for us
 

545
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,980
finding out of it like an ETA for us
well let's see responded yet but the CPU

546
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:29,990
well let's see responded yet but the CPU

yeah that makes more sense yeah 60 yeah
 

553
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,950
yeah that makes more sense yeah 60 yeah
yeah that sounds good again depends on

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:44,960
yeah that sounds good again depends on
 

555
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,800
yeah that sounds good again depends on
how fast the display responds yes as I

556
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:47,810
how fast the display responds yes as I
 

557
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,180
how fast the display responds yes as I
recall I don't think the display

558
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,190
recall I don't think the display
 

559
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,910
recall I don't think the display
responds terribly fast so if that's the

560
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
responds terribly fast so if that's the
 

561
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,180
responds terribly fast so if that's the
case one thing you could do is you could

562
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,190
case one thing you could do is you could
 

563
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,220
case one thing you could do is you could
keep one copy of the watch face in

564
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,230
keep one copy of the watch face in
 

565
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,820
keep one copy of the watch face in
memory and after you draw the watch hand

566
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:02,830
memory and after you draw the watch hand
 

567
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,510
memory and after you draw the watch hand
like the second hand let's say then to

568
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:07,520
like the second hand let's say then to
 

569
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,090
like the second hand let's say then to
erase the second hand you just pick the

570
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,100
erase the second hand you just pick the
 

571
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,140
erase the second hand you just pick the
pixels that the watch hand contained

572
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,150
pixels that the watch hand contained
 

573
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,580
pixels that the watch hand contained
from the original watch face without the

574
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:21,590
from the original watch face without the
 

575
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,580
from the original watch face without the
watch hand on it and over draw with that

576
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:24,590
watch hand on it and over draw with that
 

577
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,070
watch hand on it and over draw with that
that way it would replace all of your

578
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,080
that way it would replace all of your
 

579
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,170
that way it would replace all of your
tick marks and everything but just for

580
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:29,180
tick marks and everything but just for
 

581
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,790
tick marks and everything but just for
the second hand part forbidden hand

582
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
the second hand part forbidden hand
 

583
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,470
the second hand part forbidden hand
partner which everybody redrawing right

584
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
partner which everybody redrawing right
 

585
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,830
partner which everybody redrawing right
yeah that right that's another approach

586
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:35,840
yeah that right that's another approach
 

587
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,560
yeah that right that's another approach
and I can certainly do that it didn't

588
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:38,570
and I can certainly do that it didn't
 

589
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,860
and I can certainly do that it didn't
have to be really really slow but I'm

590
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:41,870
have to be really really slow but I'm
 

591
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,490
have to be really really slow but I'm
not I'm not sure yet how power slowed

592
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:45,500
not I'm not sure yet how power slowed
 

593
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,320
not I'm not sure yet how power slowed
the display is and I just want to try it

594
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,330
the display is and I just want to try it
 

595
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,230
the display is and I just want to try it
try it that way first and if I have to

596
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
try it that way first and if I have to
 

597
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,910
try it that way first and if I have to
then I'll be really selective as you

598
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920
then I'll be really selective as you
 

599
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,190
then I'll be really selective as you
described both be very selective about

00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,200
described both be very selective about
 

601
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,310
described both be very selective about
which pixels I wipe out and restored

602
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:57,320
which pixels I wipe out and restored
 

603
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,690
which pixels I wipe out and restored
because the second hand ticks around I

604
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:00,700
because the second hand ticks around I

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:15,270
because the second hand ticks around I
saw what was that eight megahertz right

606
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280

yeah it sounds like well again it all
 

621
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,320
yeah it sounds like well again it all
depends on how fast the display respond

622
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,330

653
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,430

00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:26,950

of time after that but I don't think it
 

661
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,430
of time after that but I don't think it

so I have this PCB that you plug the ATX
 

815
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,500
so I have this PCB that you plug the ATX
into and it gives you it actually has

819
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,630
banana plugs bp9 mm-hmm so you can so
you can unscrew it and then I just use a

820
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
you can unscrew it and then I just use a
 

821
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:12,610
you can unscrew it and then I just use a
piece of a piece of ethernet cable as my

823
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,560

so just got that like the cat 5 I've

824
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:15,570
so just got that like the cat 5 I've
 

825
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,330
so just got that like the cat 5 I've
unwound it and I just use that as a lead

826
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:17,340
unwound it and I just use that as a lead
 

827
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,640
unwound it and I just use that as a lead
and so I've got my bolt going to

828
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:19,650
and so I've got my bolt going to
 

829
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,920
and so I've got my bolt going to
whatever and then I've got 12 volts that

830
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:21,930
whatever and then I've got 12 volts that
 

831
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,110
whatever and then I've got 12 volts that
I can step down or or whatever I want to

and the high yield there are batteries
 

951
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,310
and the high yield there are batteries
that there are some batteries that are

952

that there are some batteries that are
 

953
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,690
that there are some batteries that are
going to last longer and provide a
