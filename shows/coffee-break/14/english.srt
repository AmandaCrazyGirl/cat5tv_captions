because you you bought you a pint time

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,420
because you you bought you a pint time
 

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,440
because you you bought you a pint time
right yes sir well you're gonna have to

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,450
right yes sir well you're gonna have to
 

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,120
right yes sir well you're gonna have to
figure out how to program it aren't you

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,130
figure out how to program it aren't you
 

19
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,959
figure out how to program it aren't you
I think so unless I so unless there just

20
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:38,969
I think so unless I so unless there just
 

21
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,069
I think so unless I so unless there just
happens to be anyone in the community

22
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
happens to be anyone in the community
 

23
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,389
happens to be anyone in the community
who's gonna share their source code of

24
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
who's gonna share their source code of
 

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,459
who's gonna share their source code of
course I will uh put it up on github or

00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:46,469
course I will uh put it up on github or
 

27
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,380
course I will uh put it up on github or
something like that brilliant that you

28
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,390
something like that brilliant that you
 

29
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,010
something like that brilliant that you
will let you all have at it your your

30
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,020
will let you all have at it your your
 

31
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,590
will let you all have at it your your
request for documentation I will also

32
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,600
request for documentation I will also
 

33
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,830
request for documentation I will also
add that in as well of time I'm not

34
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
add that in as well of time I'm not
 

35
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,290
add that in as well of time I'm not
going to share the screen program but

36
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,300
going to share the screen program but
 

37
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,970
going to share the screen program but
generated the screenshot that I showed

38
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:01,980
generated the screenshot that I showed
 

39
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,250
generated the screenshot that I showed
yesterday because that's based on

40
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,260
yesterday because that's based on
 

41
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,020
yesterday because that's based on
another project that I'm that I'm

42
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,030
another project that I'm that I'm
 

43
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,820
another project that I'm that I'm
working on and a catch here that but

44
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,830
working on and a catch here that but
 

45
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,880
working on and a catch here that but
certainly any any point time source code

46
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:10,890
certainly any any point time source code
 

47
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,830
certainly any any point time source code
that I have I will certainly share with

48
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:12,840
that I have I will certainly share with
 

49
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:22,249
that I have I will certainly share with
you the day the issue is going to be I

50
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:22,259
you the day the issue is going to be I
 

51
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,640
you the day the issue is going to be I
expect I'll use a Raspberry Pi to to

52
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:25,650
expect I'll use a Raspberry Pi to to
 

53
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,190
expect I'll use a Raspberry Pi to to
program it and I think it what's already

54
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,200
program it and I think it what's already
 

55
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,469
program it and I think it what's already
I'm not gonna read document what's

56
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
I'm not gonna read document what's
 

57
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,719
I'm not gonna read document what's
already been documented I'll just point

58
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:32,729
already been documented I'll just point
 

59
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,390
already been documented I'll just point
to the point 64 website where they

60
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,400
to the point 64 website where they
 

61
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,130
to the point 64 website where they
already talk about the best hardware

62
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,140
already talk about the best hardware
 

63
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,530
already talk about the best hardware
setup to use you know three or four wire

64
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,540
setup to use you know three or four wire
 

65
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,130
setup to use you know three or four wire
set up from your Raspberry Pi and then

66
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,140
set up from your Raspberry Pi and then
 

67
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,310
set up from your Raspberry Pi and then

watch itself there are four pins or four

70
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,280
watch itself there are four pins or four
 

71
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,630
watch itself there are four pins or four
holes in the circuit board most people

72
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
holes in the circuit board most people
 

73
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,090
holes in the circuit board most people
as I understand it literally just stick

74
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,100
as I understand it literally just stick
 

75
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,859
as I understand it literally just stick
pins into those they don't solve it to

76
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:57,869
pins into those they don't solve it to
 

77
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,959
pins into those they don't solve it to
those pins because it would be too easy

78
00:01:59,959 --> 00:01:59,969
those pins because it would be too easy
 

79
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,810
those pins because it would be too easy
to damage the point I'm if you do that

80
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:02,820
to damage the point I'm if you do that
 

81
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,550
to damage the point I'm if you do that
yeah so like base looking thing like

82
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,560
yeah so like base looking thing like
 

83
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,499
yeah so like base looking thing like
because the developer kit has what looks

84
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:09,509
because the developer kit has what looks
 

85
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,300
because the developer kit has what looks
like a base that you would plug the pine

86
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,310
like a base that you would plug the pine
 

87
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,950
like a base that you would plug the pine
time into what's that

88
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:12,960
time into what's that
 

89
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,290
time into what's that
looks like it comes in two parts in fact

90
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,300
looks like it comes in two parts in fact
 

91
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,440
looks like it comes in two parts in fact
probably three parts one is the front

92
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,450
probably three parts one is the front
 

93
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,990
probably three parts one is the front
face of the watch the other is the back

94
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,000
face of the watch the other is the back
 

95
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,180
face of the watch the other is the back
face of the watch but some people have

96
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,190
face of the watch but some people have
 

97
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,880
face of the watch but some people have
actually drilled a hole into so they

98
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:25,890
actually drilled a hole into so they
 

99
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,620
actually drilled a hole into so they
could feed the wires in and have the

100
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:27,630
could feed the wires in and have the
 

101
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,020
could feed the wires in and have the
thing trailing wires all over the plot

102
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,030
thing trailing wires all over the plot
 

103
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,890
thing trailing wires all over the plot
going to do that the production model of

104
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:33,900
going to do that the production model of
 

105
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,570
going to do that the production model of
the watch would actually have those two

106
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:35,580
the watch would actually have those two
 

107
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,810
the watch would actually have those two
halves you know close together and glued

108
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:38,820
halves you know close together and glued
 

109
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,850
halves you know close together and glued
together in a you know waterproof way so

110
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:40,860
together in a you know waterproof way so
 

111
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,310
together in a you know waterproof way so
that it stays waterproof yeah the

112
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,320
that it stays waterproof yeah the
 

113
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,080
that it stays waterproof yeah the
development kits don't have that so

114
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,090
development kits don't have that so
 

115
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,820
development kits don't have that so
don't expect those two halves to come

116
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:46,830
don't expect those two halves to come
 

117
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,060
don't expect those two halves to come
together and then there is a cradle that

118
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,070
together and then there is a cradle that
 

119
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,740
together and then there is a cradle that
I think you're talking about but the

120
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:51,750
I think you're talking about but the
 

121
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,750
I think you're talking about but the
whole watch just clips you two will

122
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
whole watch just clips you two will
 

123
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,330
whole watch just clips you two will
slide into it and I believe it's a

124
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:56,340
slide into it and I believe it's a
 

125
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,330
slide into it and I believe it's a
charging cradle for it okay so that

126
00:02:59,330 --> 00:02:59,340
charging cradle for it okay so that
 

127
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,130
charging cradle for it okay so that
can't be used see it would be nice if

128
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,140
can't be used see it would be nice if
 

129
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,160
can't be used see it would be nice if
that could be used to actually do the

130
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,170
that could be used to actually do the
 

131
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,240
that could be used to actually do the
pre looming firmware yeah those that the

132
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,250
pre looming firmware yeah those that the
 

133
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:14,390
pre looming firmware yeah those that the
four kings there sorry I can't hear you

134
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
four kings there sorry I can't hear you
 

135
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,130
four kings there sorry I can't hear you
there for a second I'm gonna just gonna

136
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,140
there for a second I'm gonna just gonna
 

137
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,350
there for a second I'm gonna just gonna
mute Peter there cuz see a lot of noise

138
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:18,360
mute Peter there cuz see a lot of noise
 

139
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:26,330
mute Peter there cuz see a lot of noise
dude don't unmute yourself and then make

140
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:26,340
dude don't unmute yourself and then make
 

141
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,790
dude don't unmute yourself and then make
a whole bunch sorry that's a kind of no

142
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:31,800
a whole bunch sorry that's a kind of no
 

143
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,420
a whole bunch sorry that's a kind of no
problem

144
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:32,430
problem
 

145
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,910
problem
that the four pins or the four holes in

146
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:34,920
that the four pins or the four holes in
 

147
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,190
that the four pins or the four holes in
the circuit board and not accessible to

148
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
the circuit board and not accessible to
 

149
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,930
the circuit board and not accessible to
that to that power cradle or anything

150
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:38,940
that to that power cradle or anything
 

151
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,110
that to that power cradle or anything
like that the only way to flash it would

152
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120
like that the only way to flash it would
 

153
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,940
like that the only way to flash it would
be to take the back off that connect

154
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:43,950
be to take the back off that connect
 

155
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,700
be to take the back off that connect
some wires to those four four pads on

156
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:46,710
some wires to those four four pads on
 

157
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,990
some wires to those four four pads on
the circuit board and then program it

158
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000

have to get into you're gonna have to
 

627
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,110
have to get into you're gonna have to
spend some time to learn how to take C

628
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,120
spend some time to learn how to take C
 

629

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:44,750
yeah and compile that into what are
 

633
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,700
yeah and compile that into what are
called objects obj files on Linux right

playing then it's it's just dot o files
then you have to link them all together

642
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:58,610
then you have to link them all together
 

643
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,610
then you have to link them all together
to create your executable right and now

644
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:03,620
to create your executable right and now

the process is all going to be different
 

647
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,270
the process is all going to be different
for the for the point own so it'll be

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,280
for the for the point own so it'll be
 

649
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
for the for the point own so it'll be
different because the end result is not

going to be an executable it'll be a
 

653
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,340
going to be an executable it'll be a
binary blob that you're going to have to

654
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,350
binary blob that you're going to have to
 

655
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,110
binary blob that you're going to have to
transport over to the Pine time around

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,120
transport over to the Pine time around
 

657
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,850

you're there you're going to have to

658
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:21,860
you're there you're going to have to
 

659
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,220
you're there you're going to have to
work on there you're going to have to

660
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,230
work on there you're going to have to
 

661
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,620
work on there you're going to have to
work on the physical connections that

662
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:26,630
work on the physical connections that
 

663
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,790
work on the physical connections that
you're gonna have to make between the

664
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:27,800
you're gonna have to make between the
 

665
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,340
you're gonna have to make between the
Pine time and your raspberry pi and then

666
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,350
Pine time and your raspberry pi and then
 

667
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,540
Pine time and your raspberry pi and then
you're gonna have to figure out how to

668
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:31,550
you're gonna have to figure out how to
 

669
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,730
you're gonna have to figure out how to
get just a simple C program my first one

670
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:36,740
get just a simple C program my first one
 

671
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,880
get just a simple C program my first one
is going to be the LED flashing program

672
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:39,890
is going to be the LED flashing program
 

673
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,860
is going to be the LED flashing program
and which is the equivalent of hello

674
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:41,870
and which is the equivalent of hello
 

675
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,050
and which is the equivalent of hello
world right and what it will do is it

676
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,060
world right and what it will do is it
 

677
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,409
world right and what it will do is it
will change the intensity of the

678
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:46,419
will change the intensity of the
 

679
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:49,259
will change the intensity of the
back light on the on the pine time

680
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:49,269
back light on the on the pine time

ditched each model do it every second

682
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:51,999
ditched each model do it every second
 

683
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:55,019
ditched each model do it every second
it'll go low intensity medium high

684
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:55,029
it'll go low intensity medium high
 

685
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:57,419
it'll go low intensity medium high
intensity and then back to zero and then

686
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:57,429
intensity and then back to zero and then
 

687
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,759
intensity and then back to zero and then
low intensity high that way you'll know

688
00:17:59,759 --> 00:17:59,769
low intensity high that way you'll know
 

689
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:02,220
low intensity high that way you'll know
good I've got a neck I can make an

690
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,230
good I've got a neck I can make an
 

691
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,710
good I've got a neck I can make an
executable and I can send it to the pine

692
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
executable and I can send it to the pine
 

693
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,169
executable and I can send it to the pine
tone and it will work that's a very

694
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:07,179
tone and it will work that's a very
 

695
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:08,700
tone and it will work that's a very
first set to the equivalent of a hello

696
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,710
first set to the equivalent of a hello
 

697
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,039

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,049
world right that improves that your
 

699
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,340

whole compile toolchain all works like

700
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,350
whole compile toolchain all works like
 

701
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,200
whole compile toolchain all works like
it's supposed to

702
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,210
it's supposed to
 

703
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,029
it's supposed to
then what I'll probably do will be like

704
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:18,039
then what I'll probably do will be like
 

705
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,190
then what I'll probably do will be like
literally a hello world program where I

706
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,200
literally a hello world program where I
 

707
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,909
literally a hello world program where I
will make it I'll Drive the display to

708
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
will make it I'll Drive the display to
 

709
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,859
will make it I'll Drive the display to
make a display literally the word hello

710
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:25,869
make a display literally the word hello
 

711
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:30,180
make a display literally the word hello
right yeah that the get but the exercise

712
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,190
right yeah that the get but the exercise
 

713
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,570
right yeah that the get but the exercise
for that is going to be understanding

714
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:33,580
for that is going to be understanding
 

715
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,659
for that is going to be understanding
the Adafruit video driver that they

716
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:36,669
the Adafruit video driver that they
 

717
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,060
the Adafruit video driver that they
publish so I'll be downloading that I'll

718
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,070
publish so I'll be downloading that I'll
 

719
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,710
publish so I'll be downloading that I'll
be integrating in each of the project

720
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
be integrating in each of the project
 

721
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,169
be integrating in each of the project
and then I'll literally just make it

722
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:43,179
and then I'll literally just make it
 

723
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,680
and then I'll literally just make it
hello bring up LED intensity the

724
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:46,690
hello bring up LED intensity the
 

725
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,249
hello bring up LED intensity the
fulbright make it say hello cross my

726
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:50,259
fulbright make it say hello cross my
 

727
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:56,090
fulbright make it say hello cross my
fingers and hope it works right

728
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,100

practical joke and he said hello and
 

731
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:18,810
practical joke and he said hello and
then someone else and then a third it

732
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:18,820
then someone else and then a third it
 

733
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,950
then someone else and then a third it
sounds like this could be a good

734
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:19,960
sounds like this could be a good
 

735
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,889
sounds like this could be a good

just makes it so that the script doesn't
 

893
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:27,049
just makes it so that the script doesn't
bog down the server know

bog down the server know
 

895
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,509
bog down the server know

919
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:08,330

just some people some people would look

920
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:08,340
just some people some people would look
 

921
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,700
just some people some people would look
for a tool to do it or use MailChimp or

922
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:10,710
for a tool to do it or use MailChimp or
 

923
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,049

00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:12,059
something and I'm just like I'll just
 

925
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,450
something and I'm just like I'll just
write it take me about two hours and

then they'll have the mail blast out the
 

929
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,539
then they'll have the mail blast out the
only thing I would say is don't get into

931
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:25,399

the rut of using PHP for every solution

932
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:25,409
the rut of using PHP for every solution
 

933
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:28,820
the rut of using PHP for every solution
because you know PHP is not necessarily

934
