so I still have to get up on the roof of
studio D to get that antenna down and I

316
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:22,889
studio D to get that antenna down and I
 

317
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,590
studio D to get that antenna down and I
didn't feel safe doing that while it's

318
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:24,600
didn't feel safe doing that while it's
 

319
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,920
didn't feel safe doing that while it's
while it's rainy it's a steel room so

320
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:27,930
while it's rainy it's a steel room so
 

321
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:35,350
while it's rainy it's a steel room so
not a good idea yeah

322
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360

 

323
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,389

so I was saying Debian 11 is entering

324
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
so I was saying Debian 11 is entering
 

325
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,350
so I was saying Debian 11 is entering
feature lock so my my Linux distro

326
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
feature lock so my my Linux distro
 

327
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,689
feature lock so my my Linux distro
called names Lennox is is an official

328
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:47,699
called names Lennox is is an official
 

329
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,949
called names Lennox is is an official
Debian derivative so I get like they

330
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:51,959
Debian derivative so I get like they
 

331
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,049
Debian derivative so I get like they
email me when they're locking things and

332
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:54,059
email me when they're locking things and
 

333
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,360
email me when they're locking things and
so you get kind of like a heads up when

334
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,370
so you get kind of like a heads up when
 

335
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,429
so you get kind of like a heads up when
when they're getting ready for new

336
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:58,439
when they're getting ready for new
 

337
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,850
when they're getting ready for new
transmissions so I got that email of few

338
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:01,860
transmissions so I got that email of few
 

339
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,129
transmissions so I got that email of few
weeks ago but I was so busy with the

340
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:04,139
weeks ago but I was so busy with the
 

341
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,150
weeks ago but I was so busy with the
move and everything else that was going

342
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,160
move and everything else that was going
 

343
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,400
move and everything else that was going
on that I hadn't got a chance to to do

344
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,410
on that I hadn't got a chance to to do
 

345
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,730
on that I hadn't got a chance to to do
anything yet so I did move my build base

346
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:10,740
anything yet so I did move my build base
 

347
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,929
anything yet so I did move my build base
for the docker image of gnomes Linux too

348
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:13,939
for the docker image of gnomes Linux too
 

349
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,189
for the docker image of gnomes Linux too
and I haven't uploaded this so you want

350
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:16,199
and I haven't uploaded this so you want
 

351
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,590
and I haven't uploaded this so you want
to get this on docker hub but I moved it

352
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:18,600
to get this on docker hub but I moved it
 

353
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,360
to get this on docker hub but I moved it
over to Debian 11 and then of course

354
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,370
over to Debian 11 and then of course
 

355
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,309
over to Debian 11 and then of course
rebuilt on on that so if that's

356
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:22,319
rebuilt on on that so if that's
 

357
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,329
rebuilt on on that so if that's
basically my base and like ever

358
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:26,339
basically my base and like ever
 

359
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,999
basically my base and like ever
it just takes like like a boss there's

360
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:29,009
it just takes like like a boss there's
 

361
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,509
it just takes like like a boss there's
no problem at all so cool is basically

362
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:32,519
no problem at all so cool is basically
 

363
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,220
no problem at all so cool is basically
just upgrading you could probably even

364
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,230
just upgrading you could probably even
 

365
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,730
just upgrading you could probably even
upgrade I didn't see any security

366
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:37,740
upgrade I didn't see any security
 

367
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,970
upgrade I didn't see any security
updates repositories yet so you may have

368
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:40,980
updates repositories yet so you may have
 

369
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,679
updates repositories yet so you may have
to disable those and your sources dot

370
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:42,689
to disable those and your sources dot
 

371
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:45,139
to disable those and your sources dot
list but if you wanted to on a test

372
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:45,149
list but if you wanted to on a test
 

373
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,759
list but if you wanted to on a test
system you could probably just go into

374
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:46,769
system you could probably just go into
 

375
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,150
system you could probably just go into
your sources list file and change Buster

376
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
your sources list file and change Buster
 

377
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,559
your sources list file and change Buster
to bullseye and you'll you'll do a apt

378
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:54,569
to bullseye and you'll you'll do a apt
 

379
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,809
to bullseye and you'll you'll do a apt
upgrade and get the latest version of

380
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:56,819
upgrade and get the latest version of
 

381
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,850
upgrade and get the latest version of
Debian looks like it's pretty rock-solid

382
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:58,860
Debian looks like it's pretty rock-solid
 

383
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Debian looks like it's pretty rock-solid
at this point our service is still up in

384
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:02,870
at this point our service is still up in
 

385
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,129
at this point our service is still up in
eight so we have been during the last

386
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:07,139
eight so we have been during the last
 

387
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,379
eight so we have been during the last
few months yeah definitely

388
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:09,389
few months yeah definitely
 

389
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:12,290
few months yeah definitely
but we are still getting an official

390
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:12,300
but we are still getting an official
 

391
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,780
but we are still getting an official
updates so urgent yet extensive ass

392
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:18,790
updates so urgent yet extensive ass
 

393
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,960
updates so urgent yet extensive ass
yeah compared to previous like like

394
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:22,970
yeah compared to previous like like
 

395
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,170
yeah compared to previous like like
Buster was positive forever it was

396
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:26,180
Buster was positive forever it was
 

397
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,949
Buster was positive forever it was
sitting and testing for a long time yeah

398
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
sitting and testing for a long time yeah
 

399
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,509
sitting and testing for a long time yeah
my concern with that approach solve it

400
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
my concern with that approach solve it
 

401
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,920
my concern with that approach solve it
with using an older version is you're

402
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:32,930
with using an older version is you're
 

403
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,329
with using an older version is you're
going to have older versions of things

404
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:34,339
going to have older versions of things
 

405
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:42,160
going to have older versions of things
like TLS and SSL SSH I mean OpenSSH so

406
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,170
like TLS and SSL SSH I mean OpenSSH so
 

407
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,049
like TLS and SSL SSH I mean OpenSSH so
that is a concern from a security

408
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:44,059
that is a concern from a security
 

409
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,850
that is a concern from a security
standpoint so yes you're gonna get

410
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:45,860
standpoint so yes you're gonna get
 

411
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,470
standpoint so yes you're gonna get
feature updates and things but you're

412
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:47,480
feature updates and things but you're
 

413
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,059
feature updates and things but you're
still gonna have older versions of some

414
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:49,069
still gonna have older versions of some
 

415
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,850
still gonna have older versions of some
some packages that are that have known

416
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:51,860
some packages that are that have known
 

417
00:12:51,860 --> 00:13:01,900
some packages that are that have known
exploits speaking TLS 10 years ago I

418
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:01,910
exploits speaking TLS 10 years ago I
 

419
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:09,100
exploits speaking TLS 10 years ago I
think I discovered that I was doing a

420
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,110
think I discovered that I was doing a
 

421
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,309
think I discovered that I was doing a
search sometimes looking for but I

422
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:15,319
search sometimes looking for but I
 

423
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:18,999
search sometimes looking for but I
discovered a file that was there yeah

424
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:19,009
discovered a file that was there yeah
 

425
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:21,699
discovered a file that was there yeah
they were looking for streaming

426
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:21,709
they were looking for streaming
 

427
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,650
they were looking for streaming
applications that because we are

428
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:23,660
applications that because we are
 

429
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,110
applications that because we are
explicitly abandoning those because we

430
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,120
explicitly abandoning those because we
 

431
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,879
explicitly abandoning those because we
don't have the money to pay for it and I

432
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:30,889
don't have the money to pay for it and I
 

433
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,569
don't have the money to pay for it and I
found our user having a short cost

434
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:33,579
found our user having a short cost
 

435
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,389
found our user having a short cost
executable in this and I also discovered

436
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:37,399
executable in this and I also discovered
 

437
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,240
executable in this and I also discovered
they had a suspicious looking theater

438
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,250
they had a suspicious looking theater
 

439
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,610
they had a suspicious looking theater
ball that I am in investigated and it

440
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:42,620
ball that I am in investigated and it
 

441
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,710
ball that I am in investigated and it
turned out it was a root exploit and

442
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
turned out it was a root exploit and
 

443
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
turned out it was a root exploit and
when I googled the exploit it turned out

444
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,170
when I googled the exploit it turned out
 

445
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,259
when I googled the exploit it turned out
that it didn't work because our kernel

446
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:50,269
that it didn't work because our kernel
 

447
00:13:50,269 --> 00:14:06,369
that it didn't work because our kernel
was too old oh no I was only testing to

448
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:06,379
was too old oh no I was only testing to
 

449
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:19,540
was too old oh no I was only testing to
see if it worked and going back to other

450
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,550
see if it worked and going back to other
 

451
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,519
see if it worked and going back to other
exploits that would instead have been in

452
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:21,529
exploits that would instead have been in
 

453
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,509

I think if anything the better advice to

508
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:45,610
I think if anything the better advice to
 

509
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,130
I think if anything the better advice to
removing it would be just make sure you

510
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,140
removing it would be just make sure you
 

511
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,210
removing it would be just make sure you
got the latest version

512
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,220
got the latest version
 

513
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,670
got the latest version
make sure you up-to-date and just don't

514
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:50,680
make sure you up-to-date and just don't
 

515
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,940
make sure you up-to-date and just don't
use it for like government government

516
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:53,950
use it for like government government
 

517
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,010
use it for like government government
should probably have their own hosted

518
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,020
should probably have their own hosted
 

519
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,210
should probably have their own hosted
solution but for average show users and

520
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,220
solution but for average show users and
 

521
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,310
solution but for average show users and
businesses you're not really using it

522
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
businesses you're not really using it

for anything confidential really like
 

525
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,510
for anything confidential really like
that right you just be wise to the fact

526
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:06,520
that right you just be wise to the fact
 

527
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,890
that right you just be wise to the fact
that you're using a free public service

528
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:07,900
that you're using a free public service
 

529
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,490
that you're using a free public service
or even if you're using the pro version

530
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:10,500
or even if you're using the pro version
 

531
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,730
or even if you're using the pro version
just gotta be mindful of that but there

532
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:17,740
just gotta be mindful of that but there
 

533
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:27,120
just gotta be mindful of that but there
it is Prime Minister was really

534
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,130

resources in place to have their own
 

545
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,740
