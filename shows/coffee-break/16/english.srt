you to do in the in terms of you know
building C programs just like with Peter

314
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:22,730
building C programs just like with Peter
 

315
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:29,440
building C programs just like with Peter
but my next step is to to look at the it

316
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,450
but my next step is to to look at the it
 

317
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,120
but my next step is to to look at the it
looks like there's one despaired there's

318
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,130
looks like there's one despaired there's
 

319
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,630
looks like there's one despaired there's
one example I should say that already

320
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
one example I should say that already
 

321
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,400
one example I should say that already
does a lot of what I'm trying to do so I

322
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,410
does a lot of what I'm trying to do so I
 

323
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,230
does a lot of what I'm trying to do so I
think that I will only use that example

324
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
think that I will only use that example
 

325
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,620
think that I will only use that example
or likely just grab some code from it

326
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,630
or likely just grab some code from it
 

327
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,270
or likely just grab some code from it
and include it in my own project it's

328
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,280
and include it in my own project it's
 

329
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,060
and include it in my own project it's
fairly generic code and so my plan is to

330
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,070
fairly generic code and so my plan is to
 

331
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,540
fairly generic code and so my plan is to
do that but they did not use a library

332
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:49,550
do that but they did not use a library
 

333
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,550
do that but they did not use a library
lady not use the Adafruit library they

334
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:51,560
lady not use the Adafruit library they
 

335
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,300
lady not use the Adafruit library they
drove the display directly themselves

336
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,310
drove the display directly themselves
 

337
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,280
drove the display directly themselves
which is which is something on they

338
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,290
which is which is something on they
 

339
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,140
which is which is something on they
joined the stand so that's gonna be

340
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,150
joined the stand so that's gonna be
 

341
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,540
joined the stand so that's gonna be
that's gonna be my next steps and that's

342
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:01,550
that's gonna be my next steps and that's
 

343
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,710
that's gonna be my next steps and that's
what I'll document sir yeah yep yep I

344
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:05,720
what I'll document sir yeah yep yep I
 

345
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,930
what I'll document sir yeah yep yep I
can't wait to learn that stuff and I

346
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:07,940
can't wait to learn that stuff and I
 

347
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,910
can't wait to learn that stuff and I
think that's a good good methodology and

348
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
think that's a good good methodology and
 

349
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,770
think that's a good good methodology and
maybe you know Peter can get a takeaway

350
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:11,780
maybe you know Peter can get a takeaway
 

351
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,410
maybe you know Peter can get a takeaway
from that too is to find code out there

352
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:14,420
from that too is to find code out there
 

353
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,000
from that too is to find code out there
that already does what you're trying to

354
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,010
that already does what you're trying to
 

355
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,260
that already does what you're trying to
do and even you know pull some of the

356
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,270
do and even you know pull some of the
 

357
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,540
do and even you know pull some of the
code from that that's that's how a lot

358
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:22,550
code from that that's that's how a lot
 

359
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,760
code from that that's that's how a lot
of us learn that's how open-source works

360
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:24,770
of us learn that's how open-source works
 

361
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,640
of us learn that's how open-source works
yeah things about it yeah they offer the

362
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:30,650
yeah things about it yeah they offer the
 

363
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,510
yeah things about it yeah they offer the
source to help you learn the go get the

364
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:34,520
source to help you learn the go get the
 

365
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,160
source to help you learn the go get the
died road I need money did I probably

366
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,170
died road I need money did I probably
 

367
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,260
died road I need money did I probably
good it's like in the water the

368
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,270
good it's like in the water the
 

369
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,860
good it's like in the water the
University I could probably remember out

370
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:44,870
University I could probably remember out
 

371
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,340
University I could probably remember out
to 25 years 30 25 years ago walk

372
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,350
to 25 years 30 25 years ago walk
 

373
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,970
to 25 years 30 25 years ago walk
probably remember there

374
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:50,980
probably remember there
 

375
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,120
probably remember there
probably remember to grab NATO zoetry

376
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,130
probably remember to grab NATO zoetry
 

377
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,579
probably remember to grab NATO zoetry
yeah

378
00:10:58,579 --> 00:10:58,589
yeah
 

379
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:02,610
yeah
Google is our friend these days yeah yep

380
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:02,620
Google is our friend these days yeah yep
 

381
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,710
Google is our friend these days yeah yep
that's them that's the best advice I can

382
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
that's them that's the best advice I can
 

383
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
that's them that's the best advice I can
offer you Peter I apologize but that's

384
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:06,730
offer you Peter I apologize but that's
 

385
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,759
offer you Peter I apologize but that's
the best advice that I can all good

386
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:08,769
the best advice that I can all good
 

387
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,069
the best advice that I can all good
advice no apology necessary when it's

388
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:11,079
advice no apology necessary when it's
 

389
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,269
advice no apology necessary when it's
good advice well I'd like to be able to

390
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
good advice well I'd like to be able to
 

391
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,680
good advice well I'd like to be able to
help him out and say yeah here's what

392
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:16,690
help him out and say yeah here's what
 

393
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,660
help him out and say yeah here's what
you but you need to you but to do that

394
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:18,670
you but you need to you but to do that
 

395
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,550
you but you need to you but to do that
we have to get into a lot more detail

396
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
we have to get into a lot more detail
 

397
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,970
we have to get into a lot more detail
than what what we can do what we can do

398
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:23,980
than what what we can do what we can do
 

399
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,129
than what what we can do what we can do
here so the fun process though as we

400
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:26,139
here so the fun process though as we
 

401
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,800
here so the fun process though as we
learn for sure but we all have to learn

402
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:28,810
learn for sure but we all have to learn
 

403
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,769
learn for sure but we all have to learn
at our individual level and and what it

404
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:31,779
at our individual level and and what it
 

405
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,590
at our individual level and and what it
is that you know what our project

406
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
is that you know what our project
 

407
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,840
is that you know what our project
involves right so what you develop e9 is

408
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:36,850
involves right so what you develop e9 is
 

409
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,129
involves right so what you develop e9 is
doing is very different than what

410
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:38,139
doing is very different than what
 

411
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,500
doing is very different than what
Peter's doing and the beauty of it is

412
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:40,510
Peter's doing and the beauty of it is
 

413
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,370
Peter's doing and the beauty of it is
that the the best way to learn is to

414
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:44,380
that the the best way to learn is to
 

415
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,400
that the the best way to learn is to
have a project in mind I mean the

416
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,410
have a project in mind I mean the
 

417
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,819
have a project in mind I mean the
application that I was trying to build

418
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:49,829
application that I was trying to build
 

419
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,420
application that I was trying to build
when I finally settled on that trio of

420
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,430
when I finally settled on that trio of
 

421
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,629
when I finally settled on that trio of
libraries you know Steve gtk and sqlite3

422
00:11:59,629 --> 00:11:59,639
libraries you know Steve gtk and sqlite3
 

423
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,360
libraries you know Steve gtk and sqlite3
it was it was just a specific problem I

424
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,370
it was it was just a specific problem I
 

425
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,970
it was it was just a specific problem I
was trying to solve for many many years

426
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:05,980
was trying to solve for many many years
 

427
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,720
was trying to solve for many many years
and I cycled through many the graphical

428
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:09,730
and I cycled through many the graphical
 

429
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,360
and I cycled through many the graphical
UI libraries before I finally settled on

430
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,370
UI libraries before I finally settled on
 

431
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,250
UI libraries before I finally settled on
on JDK but it was all but the whole

432
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:17,260
on JDK but it was all but the whole
 

433
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,930
on JDK but it was all but the whole
point of it was it was a very simple

434
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:18,940
point of it was it was a very simple
 

435
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,000
point of it was it was a very simple
application it doesn't do anything you

436
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,010
application it doesn't do anything you
 

437
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,740
application it doesn't do anything you
know doesn't do anything world

438
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:22,750
know doesn't do anything world
 

439
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,750
know doesn't do anything world
shattering or anything like that but it

440
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:24,760
shattering or anything like that but it
 

441
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,610
shattering or anything like that but it
was an itch I needed a scratch it was it

442
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:26,620
was an itch I needed a scratch it was it
 

443
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,759
was an itch I needed a scratch it was it
was a problem I was trying to solve and

444
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:28,769
was a problem I was trying to solve and
 

445
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,500
was a problem I was trying to solve and
that solutions been working for years

446
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:31,510
that solutions been working for years
 

447
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,780
that solutions been working for years
now and I'd be it's great that that's

448
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:33,790
now and I'd be it's great that that's
 

449
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,569
now and I'd be it's great that that's
that's how in fact that that's how I

450
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:36,579
that's how in fact that that's how I
 

451
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:39,930
that's how in fact that that's how I
learned and now learning the point I'm I

452
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:39,940
learned and now learning the point I'm I
 

453
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,090
learned and now learning the point I'm I
can draw on all that experience that

454
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,100
can draw on all that experience that
 

455
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,430
can draw on all that experience that
I've had previously I'm not sure I was

456
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
I've had previously I'm not sure I was
 

457
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,410
I've had previously I'm not sure I was
gonna say I was gonna say I'm not sure

458
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:49,420
gonna say I was gonna say I'm not sure
 

459
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,689
gonna say I was gonna say I'm not sure
the point I'm would be the first thing I

460
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:51,699
the point I'm would be the first thing I
 

461
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:53,490
the point I'm would be the first thing I
would try but hey why not you gotta

462
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:53,500
would try but hey why not you gotta
 

463
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,889
would try but hey why not you gotta
start somewhere right yes so that's

464
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:55,899
start somewhere right yes so that's
 

465
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:59,069
start somewhere right yes so that's
mostly how almost every software is made

466
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,079
mostly how almost every software is made

that way someone had something they

468
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:01,269
that way someone had something they
 

469
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,030
that way someone had something they
wanted done that or less from each they

470
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
wanted done that or less from each they
 

471
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,829
wanted done that or less from each they
wanted to scratch and I made some

472
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839
wanted to scratch and I made some
 

473
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,860
wanted to scratch and I made some
and free software and sharing source

474
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:07,870
and free software and sharing source
 

475
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,090
and free software and sharing source
code they came about because the idea

476
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,100
code they came about because the idea
 

477
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,720
code they came about because the idea
that if anyone else found any use for it

478
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:14,730
that if anyone else found any use for it
 

479
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,110
that if anyone else found any use for it
about it right why reinvent the wheel

480
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
about it right why reinvent the wheel
 

481
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,939
about it right why reinvent the wheel
right that's exactly the amazing thing I

482
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:23,949
right that's exactly the amazing thing I
 

483
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,939
right that's exactly the amazing thing I
am I have it maybe seven or eight

484
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:28,949

made only one from there from the ground
 

491
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:43,800

bought my first computer it was at 286

496
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:55,529
bought my first computer it was at 286
 

497
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,329
bought my first computer it was at 286
and no one knew how big the hard drive

498
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:00,339
and no one knew how big the hard drive
 

499
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:06,840
and no one knew how big the hard drive
was and and eventually IRA managed to

500
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:06,850
was and and eventually IRA managed to
 

501
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,840
was and and eventually IRA managed to
find out but the one a.m. feature that

502
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:09,850
find out but the one a.m. feature that
 

503

ms-dos they didn't have as far as I

504
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:13,660
ms-dos they didn't have as far as I
 

505
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,730
ms-dos they didn't have as far as I
could find was how to find out in an

506
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:17,740
could find was how to find out in an
 

507
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,699
could find was how to find out in an
easy way how much free space you had on

508
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:20,709
easy way how much free space you had on
 

509
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,559
easy way how much free space you had on
the drive it could easily tell you how

510
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:22,569
the drive it could easily tell you how
 

511
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:24,240
the drive it could easily tell you how
much space you used and you can

512
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,250
much space you used and you can
 

513
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,460
much space you used and you can
calculate it based on how big the big

514
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,470
calculate it based on how big the big
 

515
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,730
calculate it based on how big the big
drivers from how much free had left but

516
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:29,740
drivers from how much free had left but
 

517
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,629
drivers from how much free had left but
then but that required you to know how

518
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:33,639
then but that required you to know how
 

519
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,370
then but that required you to know how
big that big their drivers and I didn't

520
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:35,380
big that big their drivers and I didn't
 

521
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,370
big that big their drivers and I didn't
know so I got someone gave me a copy of

522
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:40,380
know so I got someone gave me a copy of
 

523
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,170

excellent built-in help system you could

526
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,250

527
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,929
excellent built-in help system you could
browse for hours on the end and on each

00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:51,939
browse for hours on the end and on each
 

529
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:55,079
browse for hours on the end and on each
each function had an example of how you

530
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:55,089
each function had an example of how you
 

531
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,689
each function had an example of how you
use the code so I used that and I made

532
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:57,699
use the code so I used that and I made
 

533
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,699
use the code so I used that and I made
something that tell that they told me

is and MINIX said that in he discovered

590
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:50,509
is and MINIX said that in he discovered
 

591
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,230
is and MINIX said that in he discovered
he wanted to add some function study and

592
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,240
he wanted to add some function study and
 

593
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:02,379
he wanted to add some function study and
needed and talking about it extend it

594
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:02,389
needed and talking about it extend it
 

595
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,529
needed and talking about it extend it
because he did just enough of what he

596
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:05,539
because he did just enough of what he
 

597
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:10,059
because he did just enough of what he
wanted to do and I mean the last ten

598
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:10,069
wanted to do and I mean the last ten
 

599
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,520
wanted to do and I mean the last ten
years up until that point Elliot or also

600
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,530
years up until that point Elliot or also
 

601
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,799
years up until that point Elliot or also
had always made everything himself

602
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:14,809
had always made everything himself
 

603
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,699
had always made everything himself
because that just what she had to do and

604
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:17,709
because that just what she had to do and
 

605
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,990
because that just what she had to do and
so how how can this be yeah it's hard

606
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,000
so how how can this be yeah it's hard
 

607
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,419
so how how can this be yeah it's hard
it's harder I think now to innovate

608
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:25,429
it's harder I think now to innovate
 

609
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,640
it's harder I think now to innovate
because a lot of stuff has already been

because a lot of stuff has already been
 

611
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,740
because a lot of stuff has already been
done before it's like you say why

reinvent the wheel but
 

615
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,039
reinvent the wheel but
you know there are still things that we

you know there are still things that we
 

617
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,690
you know there are still things that we
can come up with ideas that we can come

618
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:34,700
can come up with ideas that we can come
 

619
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,600
can come up with ideas that we can come
up with better ways or ways to take

decentralized finance well the problem
 

637
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,399
decentralized finance well the problem
with that is that that blockchain is

with that is that that blockchain is
 

639
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,740
with that is that that blockchain is
getting bigger and bigger you try to

contains absolutely everything and then
 

653
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,899
contains absolutely everything and then
a small note and yeah I've got your

654
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:25,909
a small note and yeah I've got your
 

655
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:28,600
a small note and yeah I've got your
Raspberry Pi running with a complete

656
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,610
Raspberry Pi running with a complete
 

657
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,490
Raspberry Pi running with a complete
note and also lightning note on it oh

658
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:30,500
note and also lightning note on it oh
 

659
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,110
note and also lightning note on it oh
it's possible to do that

660
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,120

 

661
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,930

speaking of Raspberry Pi again a note

662
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:37,940
speaking of Raspberry Pi again a note
 

663
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,289
speaking of Raspberry Pi again a note
for Robbie one of the things that I did

664
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:41,299
for Robbie one of the things that I did
 

665
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:46,659
for Robbie one of the things that I did
was to get raspbian OS which i think is

666
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:46,669
was to get raspbian OS which i think is
 

667
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,279
was to get raspbian OS which i think is
a Debian based OS running on Miraz PI

668
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:50,289
a Debian based OS running on Miraz PI
 

669
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:54,220
a Debian based OS running on Miraz PI
the package that I was thinking of using

670
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,230
the package that I was thinking of using
 

671
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,560
the package that I was thinking of using
that I was still thinking of using for

672
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:56,570
that I was still thinking of using for
 

673
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,870
that I was still thinking of using for
driving or programming date the phone

674
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
driving or programming date the phone
 

675
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,950
driving or programming date the phone
time they suggested you know hardwiring

676
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
time they suggested you know hardwiring
 

677
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,919
time they suggested you know hardwiring
it to the Raspberry Pi and then using

678
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:05,929
it to the Raspberry Pi and then using
 

679
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,919
it to the Raspberry Pi and then using
the R as part of programmer yeah I

680
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:08,929
the R as part of programmer yeah I
 

681
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:11,049
the R as part of programmer yeah I
thought that what that meant was that

682
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,059
thought that what that meant was that
 

683
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,680
thought that what that meant was that
they would need a proper programming

684
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:14,690
they would need a proper programming
 

685
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,350
they would need a proper programming
environment on the Raspberry Pi itself

686
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
environment on the Raspberry Pi itself
 

687
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,610
environment on the Raspberry Pi itself
you know something like studio code or

688
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:21,620
you know something like studio code or
 

689
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,000
you know something like studio code or
code blocks or or VI or any other editor

690
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,010
code blocks or or VI or any other editor
 

691
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:32,010
code blocks or or VI or any other editor
it doesn't matter what but definitely

692
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,020
it doesn't matter what but definitely
 

693
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,810
it doesn't matter what but definitely
that's not required apparently the idea

694
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:34,820
that's not required apparently the idea
 

695
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,000
that's not required apparently the idea
is the way it's set up is the Raspberry

696
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,010
is the way it's set up is the Raspberry
 

697
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,909
is the way it's set up is the Raspberry
Pi is continually trying to talk to the

698
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919

699
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,000

watch using I think it's open o CB or

700
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,010
watch using I think it's open o CB or
 

701
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,950
watch using I think it's open o CB or
something like that

702
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
something like that
 

703
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,799
something like that
and all you do is you telling it into

704
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:47,809
and all you do is you telling it into
 

705
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:49,690
and all you do is you telling it into
the Raspberry Pi you do all the main

706
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:49,700
the Raspberry Pi you do all the main
 

707
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,760
the Raspberry Pi you do all the main
work on a laptop or your desktop or

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:51,770
work on a laptop or your desktop or
 

709
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,980
work on a laptop or your desktop or
whatever and you all you do then is you

710
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:53,990
whatever and you all you do then is you
 

711
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,690
whatever and you all you do then is you
just tell that to the Raspberry Pi and

712
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:55,700
just tell that to the Raspberry Pi and
 

713
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,630
just tell that to the Raspberry Pi and
you just and you just upload the image

714
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
you just and you just upload the image
 

715
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,010
you just and you just upload the image

really well in that respect but the
 

741
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,840
really well in that respect but the
Raspberry Pi does too that thing is that

742

and all that but it'll do for for a
 

757
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,240
and all that but it'll do for for a
programming environment so yes that's

758
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,250
programming environment so yes that's
 

759
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,279
programming environment so yes that's
what is beautiful it's a beautiful

especially the size though so

764
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:16,940
especially the size though so
 

765
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,799

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:28,940
you get excited about I'm thinking
 

775
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,940
you get excited about I'm thinking
what's all this excitement about these

776
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:30,950
what's all this excitement about these
 

777
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,190
what's all this excitement about these
single board computers until you realize

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,350
single board computers until you realize
they're and as I mentioned that last one

780
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
they're and as I mentioned that last one
 

781
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,899
they're and as I mentioned that last one
ear rivaling desktops in terms of

00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:37,909
ear rivaling desktops in terms of
 

783
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:40,600
ear rivaling desktops in terms of
performance it's just crazy but I also

784
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:40,610
performance it's just crazy but I also
 

785
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,120
performance it's just crazy but I also
find great with the pay is that you can

786
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,130
find great with the pay is that you can
 

787
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,260
find great with the pay is that you can
experiments you can attach different to

788
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,270
experiments you can attach different to
 

789
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,560
experiments you can attach different to
gadgets and just play around with it

790
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:49,570
gadgets and just play around with it
 

791
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,230

you can't do that with a desktop that's

794
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:55,909
you can't do that with a desktop that's
 

795
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:57,750
you can't do that with a desktop that's
true you can't you can't

796
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
true you can't you can't
 

797
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,050
true you can't you can't
do it though with an Arduino yeah yeah

798
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,060
do it though with an Arduino yeah yeah
 

799
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,360
do it though with an Arduino yeah yeah
and and here's a here's another thing

800
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,370
and and here's a here's another thing
 

801
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,490
and and here's a here's another thing
another comment a real quick side coming

802
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:05,500
another comment a real quick side coming
 

803
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,530
another comment a real quick side coming
for you Robbie's we were talking about

804
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:07,540
for you Robbie's we were talking about
 

805
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,230
for you Robbie's we were talking about
the doorbell that displays the old cars

806
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240

image on the at idea studio I would use

808
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,050
image on the at idea studio I would use
 

809
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,470
image on the at idea studio I would use
the odd I think I would use the Arduino

810
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
the odd I think I would use the Arduino
 

811
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,500
the odd I think I would use the Arduino
for that and here's the reason why is

812
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,510
for that and here's the reason why is
 

813
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,200
for that and here's the reason why is
because if the power goes out for any

814
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,210
because if the power goes out for any
 

815
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,180
because if the power goes out for any
reason even if you connect your a spy to

816
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,190
reason even if you connect your a spy to
 

817
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,590
reason even if you connect your a spy to
a them to a UPS eventually the UPS will

818
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:28,600
a them to a UPS eventually the UPS will
 

819
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,020
a them to a UPS eventually the UPS will
will run out of power and if the power

820
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,030
will run out of power and if the power
 

821
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,180
will run out of power and if the power
goes out unexpectedly on the Raspberry

822
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,190
goes out unexpectedly on the Raspberry
 

823
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,840

Pi you end up with roughly hurt yes you

824
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:36,850
Pi you end up with roughly hurt yes you
 

825
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,940
Pi you end up with roughly hurt yes you
end up corrupting the image on the SD

826
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:38,950
end up corrupting the image on the SD
 

827
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,270
end up corrupting the image on the SD
card and that means that it just quits

828
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,280
card and that means that it just quits
 

829
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,180
card and that means that it just quits
working right even when the power comes

830
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,190
working right even when the power comes
 

831
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,790
working right even when the power comes
back it it won't reboot because the SD

832
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:50,800
back it it won't reboot because the SD
 

833
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,540
back it it won't reboot because the SD
cards corrupted Arduino however that's

834
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:54,550
cards corrupted Arduino however that's
 

835
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,760
cards corrupted Arduino however that's
not true once you've programmed it much

836
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:56,770
not true once you've programmed it much
 

837
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,800
not true once you've programmed it much
like to find time once you've programmed

838
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:58,810
like to find time once you've programmed
 

839
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,790
like to find time once you've programmed
it even if the power goes out it'll stop

840
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:02,800
it even if the power goes out it'll stop
 

841
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,760
it even if the power goes out it'll stop
working well the power is out obviously

842
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:04,770
working well the power is out obviously
 

843
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,190
working well the power is out obviously
but but as soon as the power comes back

844
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:08,200
but but as soon as the power comes back
 

845
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,850
but but as soon as the power comes back
on again

846
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:08,860
on again
 

847
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,160

bang it just starts work it's a straight

848
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,170
bang it just starts work it's a straight
 

849
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,160
bang it just starts work it's a straight
it's like it's like the old computers

850
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,170
it's like it's like the old computers
 

851
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,630
it's like it's like the old computers
where it just boots right into the ROM

852
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:15,640
where it just boots right into the ROM
 

853
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,360
where it just boots right into the ROM
real quick right exactly and I like what

854
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,370
real quick right exactly and I like what
 

855
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,220
real quick right exactly and I like what
you explained about the pine time that's

856
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,230
you explained about the pine time that's
 

857
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,590
you explained about the pine time that's
interesting yes so can you can you write

858
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:22,600
interesting yes so can you can you write
 

859
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,200
interesting yes so can you can you write
full programs for like as far as Arduino

860
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,210
full programs for like as far as Arduino
 

861
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,390
full programs for like as far as Arduino
goes my experience with Arduino so far

862
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:27,400
goes my experience with Arduino so far
 

863
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,740
goes my experience with Arduino so far
has been strictly setting up relays that

864
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:31,750
has been strictly setting up relays that
 

865
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,380
has been strictly setting up relays that
would be triggered by events that's as

866
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:34,390
would be triggered by events that's as
 

867
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,880
would be triggered by events that's as
advanced as it's gone I've never hooked

868
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:35,890
advanced as it's gone I've never hooked
 

869
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,970
advanced as it's gone I've never hooked
up a screen to one so that's why I

870
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:38,980
up a screen to one so that's why I
 

871
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,610
up a screen to one so that's why I
hesitated I do have a screen on my

872
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:43,620
hesitated I do have a screen on my
 

873
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,620
hesitated I do have a screen on my
Arduino and I have been able to draw

874
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:46,630
Arduino and I have been able to draw
 

875
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,700
Arduino and I have been able to draw
images and text to it but I don't know

876
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:50,710
images and text to it but I don't know
 

877
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,710
images and text to it but I don't know
if it's a touchscreen or I don't I doubt

878
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:52,720
if it's a touchscreen or I don't I doubt
 

879
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,210
if it's a touchscreen or I don't I doubt
that it's a touchscreen so you can't get

880
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:57,220
that it's a touchscreen so you can't get
 

881
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,000
that it's a touchscreen so you can't get
it really easy on a PI right because you

882
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,010
it really easy on a PI right because you
 

883
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,950
it really easy on a PI right because you
can just and plug in an HDMI monitor

884
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:01,960
can just and plug in an HDMI monitor
 

885
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,650
can just and plug in an HDMI monitor
with USB touchscreen capabilities and

886
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:04,660
with USB touchscreen capabilities and
 

887
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,100
with USB touchscreen capabilities and
you're done

888
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,110
you're done
 

889
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,840
you're done
yes that's true yep yep so yeah I there

890
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:09,850
yes that's true yep yep so yeah I there
 

891
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,310
yes that's true yep yep so yeah I there
are pros and cons just from

892
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,320
are pros and cons just from
 

893
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,840
are pros and cons just from
but if the power goes yeah for any

894
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:12,850
but if the power goes yeah for any
 

895
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,580
but if the power goes yeah for any
reason and it shuts down the raw spy

896
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:16,590
reason and it shuts down the raw spy
 

897
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,730
reason and it shuts down the raw spy
connectedly

898
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:17,740
connectedly

you're done we're having like a GPIO

900
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:21,220
you're done we're having like a GPIO
 

901
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,710
you're done we're having like a GPIO
powered I took I squared C ups built

into the PI that's what I prefer so

904
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
into the PI that's what I prefer so
 

905
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,420

things about the PI and the form factor
 

923
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:26,870
things about the PI and the form factor
is that it's a good way for people

on their big computers today and often

936
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:46,930
on their big computers today and often
 

937
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,930
on their big computers today and often
it's so so big and complex that they're

938
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:48,940
it's so so big and complex that they're
 

939
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,960
it's so so big and complex that they're
and they are afraid to even open up and

940
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:51,970
and they are afraid to even open up and
 

941
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,230

you have to put it together to make it

944
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:57,340
you have to put it together to make it
 

945
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:04,230
you have to put it together to make it
look nice so and then that also is on a

way for people they get excited about
 

949
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,030
way for people they get excited about
actually doing some programming and

950
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,040
actually doing some programming and
 

951
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,210
actually doing some programming and
learning how to do that sure yeah along

952
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:12,220
learning how to do that sure yeah along
 

953

of Mini ITX so it'll be screwed in just
 

987
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,779
of Mini ITX so it'll be screwed in just
like a motherboard and then I'm gonna

988
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:00,789
like a motherboard and then I'm gonna
 

989
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:04,979
like a motherboard and then I'm gonna
have individual standoffs for each type

990
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:04,989
have individual standoffs for each type
 

991
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,719
have individual standoffs for each type
of single board computer that I want to

992
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:06,729
of single board computer that I want to
 

993
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:08,849
of single board computer that I want to
use in there so I can have a mix of

994
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:08,859
use in there so I can have a mix of
 

995
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:12,239
use in there so I can have a mix of
raspberry PI's and Odroid Xu fours and

whatever else I want to put in there I

998
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:14,379
whatever else I want to put in there I
 

999
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:18,089
whatever else I want to put in there I
figure a mini ITX is gonna hold probably

1000
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:18,099
figure a mini ITX is gonna hold probably
 

1001
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,729
figure a mini ITX is gonna hold probably
at least 5 or 6 single board computers

1002
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:20,739
at least 5 or 6 single board computers
 

1003
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,310
at least 5 or 6 single board computers
in that one chassis plus I don't need to

1004
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:23,320
in that one chassis plus I don't need to
 

1005
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,629
in that one chassis plus I don't need to
put any hard drives so I can probably

1006
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:24,639
put any hard drives so I can probably
 

1007
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,060
put any hard drives so I can probably
stick one over there and probably don't

1008
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,070
stick one over there and probably don't
 

1009
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,029
stick one over there and probably don't
need a standard traditional power supply

1010
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:30,039
need a standard traditional power supply
 

1011
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,549
need a standard traditional power supply
so I can stick one over there so should

1012
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:32,559
so I can stick one over there so should
 

1013
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,859
so I can stick one over there so should
have a lot of room to put stuff in then

1014
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:34,869
have a lot of room to put stuff in then
 

1015
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,619
have a lot of room to put stuff in then
I'm going to put a barrel plug on the

1016
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:37,629
I'm going to put a barrel plug on the
 

1017
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:39,419
I'm going to put a barrel plug on the
side of the case which I'm gonna be able

1018
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:39,429
side of the case which I'm gonna be able
 

1019
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:42,839
side of the case which I'm gonna be able
to plug in a 5 volt 15 amp power supply

1020
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:42,849
to plug in a 5 volt 15 amp power supply
 

1021
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:45,089
to plug in a 5 volt 15 amp power supply
like a laptop power supply or something

1022
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:45,099
like a laptop power supply or something
 

1023
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:49,469
like a laptop power supply or something
and just basically just run a circuit

1024
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:49,479
and just basically just run a circuit
 

1025
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,570
and just basically just run a circuit
for the power for all those boards to be

1026
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:51,580
for the power for all those boards to be
 

1027
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,909
for the power for all those boards to be
powered off of that 5 volt scar now is

1028
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
powered off of that 5 volt scar now is
 

1029
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,310
powered off of that 5 volt scar now is
this gonna be like a drawer a drawer

1030
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
this gonna be like a drawer a drawer
 

1031
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,989
this gonna be like a drawer a drawer
arrangement that you can just pull the

1032
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:57,999
arrangement that you can just pull the
 

1033
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:00,509
arrangement that you can just pull the
thing out on a drawer or you'd have to

1034
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:00,519
thing out on a drawer or you'd have to
 

1035
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,489
thing out on a drawer or you'd have to
get rails for that yeah you'd have to

1036
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:02,499
get rails for that yeah you'd have to
 

1037
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:04,139
get rails for that yeah you'd have to
get rails for that so I'm just gonna I'm

1038
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:04,149
get rails for that so I'm just gonna I'm
 

1039
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,239
get rails for that so I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna bolt it right on the on the

1040
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:06,249
just gonna bolt it right on the on the
 

1041
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,519
just gonna bolt it right on the on the
panel but it has a removable panel just

1042
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:08,529
panel but it has a removable panel just
 

1043
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:11,369
panel but it has a removable panel just
like any server chassis would so if I if

1044
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:11,379
like any server chassis would so if I if
 

1045
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,680
like any server chassis would so if I if
I place it up where there's an opening

1046
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,690
I place it up where there's an opening
 

1047
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,389
I place it up where there's an opening
above then then I'd still be able to

1048
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:15,399
above then then I'd still be able to
 

1049
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:17,609
above then then I'd still be able to
access it to change the ground if you

1050
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:17,619
access it to change the ground if you
 

1051
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:19,979
access it to change the ground if you
definitely use more than one you did too

1052
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:19,989
definitely use more than one you did too
 

1053
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:26,879
definitely use more than one you did too
oh yeah beg your pardon

1054
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:26,889
oh yeah beg your pardon
 

1055
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:29,430
oh yeah beg your pardon
you making a single board supercomputer

1056
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
you making a single board supercomputer
 

1057
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,789
you making a single board supercomputer
pretty much yeah I don't think I'm gonna

1058
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
pretty much yeah I don't think I'm gonna
 

1059
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,739
pretty much yeah I don't think I'm gonna
I don't think I'm gonna cluster it i nee

1060
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:34,749
I don't think I'm gonna cluster it i nee
 

1061
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,619
I don't think I'm gonna cluster it i nee
is the cluster board for clustering but

1062
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:36,629
is the cluster board for clustering but
 

1063
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:38,970
is the cluster board for clustering but
but I am going to have it

1064
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:38,980
but I am going to have it
 

1065
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,640
but I am going to have it
so that it's like so that I can have all

1066
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:41,650
so that it's like so that I can have all
 

1067
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,299
so that it's like so that I can have all
the different purposes of these boards

1068
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:44,309
the different purposes of these boards
 

1069
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,460
the different purposes of these boards
in one chassis I just want to it just

1070
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:47,470
in one chassis I just want to it just
 

1071
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,710
in one chassis I just want to it just
looks clean right just to look really

1072
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:49,720
looks clean right just to look really
 

1073
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,289
looks clean right just to look really
nice so cuz I've got various things that

1074
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:52,299
nice so cuz I've got various things that
 

1075
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,180
nice so cuz I've got various things that
are running off a single board computers

1076
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,190
are running off a single board computers
 

1077
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,070
are running off a single board computers
and I'd like to do that more and more

1078
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080
and I'd like to do that more and more
 

1079
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,150
and I'd like to do that more and more
now and to you know it's silent goes in

1080
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,160
now and to you know it's silent goes in
 

1081
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,330
now and to you know it's silent goes in
the rack it's cool I just can't imagine

1082
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:03,340
the rack it's cool I just can't imagine
 

1083
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,919
the rack it's cool I just can't imagine
what somebody could do with that many

1084
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:04,929

enough data which kind of strange to me

1166
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:57,470
enough data which kind of strange to me
 

1167
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,080
enough data which kind of strange to me
I would have thought they could I don't

1168
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,090
I would have thought they could I don't
 

1169
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,850
I would have thought they could I don't
think they've searched the attempt of

1170
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:00,860
think they've searched the attempt of
 

1171
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,780
think they've searched the attempt of
the sky for radio signals yeah but they

1172
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:04,790
the sky for radio signals yeah but they
 

1173
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:10,570
the sky for radio signals yeah but they
claim they need to start analyzing all

1174
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:10,580
claim they need to start analyzing all
 

1175
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,120
claim they need to start analyzing all
the data and coming up with an actual

1176
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,130
the data and coming up with an actual
 

1177
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,380
the data and coming up with an actual
paper to submit for rate for the for the

1178
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,390
paper to submit for rate for the for the
 

1179
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,810

research project I mean that's what the

1180
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:19,820
research project I mean that's what the
 

1181
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,340
research project I mean that's what the
research front that's what this is right

1182
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,350
research front that's what this is right
 

1183
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,850
research front that's what this is right
it is a research project whose I whose

1184
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:24,860
it is a research project whose I whose
 

1185
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,090
it is a research project whose I whose
aim is to say here's what we did is what

1186
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,100
aim is to say here's what we did is what
 

1187
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,210
aim is to say here's what we did is what
we expected is what we found yeah

1188
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,220
we expected is what we found yeah
 

1189
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,560
we expected is what we found yeah
so I've got a bet they've started that

1190
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:34,570
so I've got a bet they've started that
 

1191
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,280
so I've got a bet they've started that
you know analyzing phase rather than

1192
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,290
you know analyzing phase rather than
 

1193
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,650
you know analyzing phase rather than
rather than focus so much on

1194
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:40,660
rather than focus so much on
 

1195
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,600
rather than focus so much on
undistributing workload and having the

1196
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:43,610
undistributing workload and having the
 

1197
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,100
undistributing workload and having the
results come down and collating are you

1198
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,110
results come down and collating are you
 

1199
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,680
results come down and collating are you
gonna recommit your hardware to

1200
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:47,690
gonna recommit your hardware to
 

1201
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,660
gonna recommit your hardware to
