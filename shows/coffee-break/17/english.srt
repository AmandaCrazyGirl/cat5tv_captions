with the pink balls with the 360 but we
 

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,300
with the pink balls with the 360 but we
didn't we didn't quite get there so but

didn't we didn't quite get there so but
then you made me think hey maybe maybe

78
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
then you made me think hey maybe maybe
 

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,040
then you made me think hey maybe maybe
maybe because we've upgraded the

80
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,050
maybe because we've upgraded the
 

81
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,949
maybe because we've upgraded the
computer it might not be as dreadful as

82
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
computer it might not be as dreadful as
 

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,930
computer it might not be as dreadful as
a scenario as it was the first time

84
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:40,940
a scenario as it was the first time
 

85
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,100
a scenario as it was the first time
around everything guys remember episode

86

471 I shot it in 360 video and it took

88
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:47,989
471 I shot it in 360 video and it took
 

89
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,620
471 I shot it in 360 video and it took
two weeks to produce it

90

two weeks to produce it
 

91
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,930

I remember you talking about it it
 

93
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,000
I remember you talking about it it
looked pretty good and it worked because

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,010
looked pretty good and it worked because
 

95
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,310
looked pretty good and it worked because
I used my I don't have a snazzy bi hits

except for the resolution on the screen
 

103
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,970
except for the resolution on the screen
which was pretty crappy and that's not

104
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:15,980
which was pretty crappy and that's not
 

105
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,600
which was pretty crappy and that's not
your fault

106
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:16,610
your fault
 

107
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,520
your fault
that's the problem that's the phones

108
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,530
that's the problem that's the phones
 

109
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,660
that's the problem that's the phones
problem yeah I've got a lot I've got the

110
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:22,670
problem yeah I've got a lot I've got the
 

111
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,039
problem yeah I've got a lot I've got the
larger pocket phone now so I'm hoping

112
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,049
larger pocket phone now so I'm hoping
 

113
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:25,930
larger pocket phone now so I'm hoping
it'll work a little bit but yeah it

114
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:25,940
it'll work a little bit but yeah it
 

115
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,479
it'll work a little bit but yeah it
looked fine I was able to paint until

116
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,489
looked fine I was able to paint until
 

117
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,080
looked fine I was able to paint until
moving all wet and it whipped so that

118
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,090
moving all wet and it whipped so that
 

119
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,990
moving all wet and it whipped so that
that was my first foray at 360 VR video

120
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,000
that was my first foray at 360 VR video
 

121
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,890
that was my first foray at 360 VR video
but it was using kind of a makeshift

122
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:37,900
but it was using kind of a makeshift
 

123
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,449
but it was using kind of a makeshift
setup that I had created with hardware

124
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:40,459
setup that I had created with hardware
 

125
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,870
setup that I had created with hardware
that I got at the hardware store and two

126
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:43,880
that I got at the hardware store and two
 

127
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,539
that I got at the hardware store and two
fisheye lenses so I had them put it

128
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:46,549
fisheye lenses so I had them put it
 

129
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,240
fisheye lenses so I had them put it
back-to-back in shooting video on both

130
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,250
back-to-back in shooting video on both
 

131
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,190
back-to-back in shooting video on both
sides then I had to stitch it together

132
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
sides then I had to stitch it together
 

133
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,550
sides then I had to stitch it together
in blender and then export it and then

134
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
in blender and then export it and then
 

135
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,860
in blender and then export it and then
create the metadata and then import it

136
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:56,870
create the metadata and then import it
 

137
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,150
create the metadata and then import it
to things like YouTube and everything

138
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,160
to things like YouTube and everything
 

139
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,330
to things like YouTube and everything
else so so it was a lot of work and then

140
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:01,340
else so so it was a lot of work and then
 

141
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,910
else so so it was a lot of work and then
editing it like like piecing it together

142
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
editing it like like piecing it together
 

143
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,440
editing it like like piecing it together
and making sure the lips were fairly

144
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,450
and making sure the lips were fairly
 

145
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,930
and making sure the lips were fairly
well synced it was a brutal nightmare on

146
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:07,940
well synced it was a brutal nightmare on
 

147
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,300
well synced it was a brutal nightmare on
that old system but I'm thinking might

148
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,310
that old system but I'm thinking might
 

149
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,370
that old system but I'm thinking might
be worth trying on the new i9 because I

150
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,380
be worth trying on the new i9 because I
 

151
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,440
be worth trying on the new i9 because I
think there's enough power there to be

152
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,450
think there's enough power there to be
 

153
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,210
think there's enough power there to be
able to really pull it off so I'm

154
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,220
able to really pull it off so I'm
 

155
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,699
able to really pull it off so I'm
curious because if we could do it with

156
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:18,709
curious because if we could do it with
 

157
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,979
curious because if we could do it with
existing hardware and and do it with

158
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:20,989
existing hardware and and do it with
 

159
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,800
existing hardware and and do it with
kind of makeshift hardware mm-hmm that

160
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:23,810
kind of makeshift hardware mm-hmm that
 

161
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,570
kind of makeshift hardware mm-hmm that
would be something else do you know what

162
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:25,580
would be something else do you know what
 

163
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,680
would be something else do you know what
else I work with what you've got

164
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,690
else I work with what you've got
 

165
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,320
else I work with what you've got
yeah if I can make it work for sure but

166
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,330
yeah if I can make it work for sure but
 

167
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,550
yeah if I can make it work for sure but
you know what you know what else is

168
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:31,560
you know what you know what else is
 

169
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,190
you know what you know what else is
really neat about it is that any of the

170
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,200
really neat about it is that any of the
 

171
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,130
really neat about it is that any of the
consumer 360 cameras that are out there

172
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,140
consumer 360 cameras that are out there
 

173
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,900
consumer 360 cameras that are out there
are boasting what resolution in orange I

174
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:41,910
are boasting what resolution in orange I
 

175
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,360
are boasting what resolution in orange I
think from 1080p to 4k

176
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,370
think from 1080p to 4k
 

177
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,900
think from 1080p to 4k
I think 4k as high as they go I think I

178
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:47,910
I think 4k as high as they go I think I
 

179
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,440
I think 4k as high as they go I think I
saw one that was 8k but it's the reviews

180
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,450
saw one that was 8k but it's the reviews
 

181
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,800
saw one that was 8k but it's the reviews
so far that it's terrible like it's it's

182
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:54,810
so far that it's terrible like it's it's
 

183
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,590
so far that it's terrible like it's it's
really really bad so my question is

184
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
really really bad so my question is
 

185
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,870
really really bad so my question is
you're having the same problem or you're

186
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
you're having the same problem or you're
 

187
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,820
you're having the same problem or you're
gonna have the same problem with 360 as

188
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:01,830
gonna have the same problem with 360 as
 

189
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,360
gonna have the same problem with 360 as
you are with your current cameras you

190
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,370
you are with your current cameras you
 

191
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,850
you are with your current cameras you
shoot at 4k so that you can zoom in and

192
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:07,860
shoot at 4k so that you can zoom in and
 

193
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,940
shoot at 4k so that you can zoom in and
still get a 1k picture when you're

194
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:10,950
still get a 1k picture when you're
 

195
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,070
still get a 1k picture when you're
zoomed in yeah I have a similar problem

196
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,080
zoomed in yeah I have a similar problem
 

197
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,880
zoomed in yeah I have a similar problem
with the 360 Cameron's well here's

198
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:16,890
with the 360 Cameron's well here's
 

199
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,580
with the 360 Cameron's well here's
what's different about ours is if you

200
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:19,590
what's different about ours is if you
 

201
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,650
what's different about ours is if you
consider a a consumer 360 camera you if

202
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:24,660
consider a a consumer 360 camera you if
 

203
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,010
consider a a consumer 360 camera you if
they say it's 4k that means the whole

204
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,020
they say it's 4k that means the whole
 

205
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,130
they say it's 4k that means the whole
equirectangular video is 4k right so

206
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,140
equirectangular video is 4k right so
 

207
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,040
equirectangular video is 4k right so
basically if you were to zoom out and

208
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,050
basically if you were to zoom out and
 

209
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,620
basically if you were to zoom out and
see everything in the whole 360 sphere

210
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,630
see everything in the whole 360 sphere
 

211
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,430
see everything in the whole 360 sphere
that's 4k but now what you do is when

212
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,440
that's 4k but now what you do is when
 

213
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
that's 4k but now what you do is when
you put that in your headset you're not

214
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:41,850
you put that in your headset you're not
 

215
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,010
you put that in your headset you're not
looking at everything you're only

216
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,020
looking at everything you're only
 

217
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,590
looking at everything you're only
looking at a little 7 drawing key window

218
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
looking at a little 7 drawing key window
 

219
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,110
looking at a little 7 drawing key window
of that right so when you look up you're

220
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
of that right so when you look up you're
 

221
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,710
of that right so when you look up you're
still only seeing 720p or something like

222
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:51,720
still only seeing 720p or something like
 

223
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:51,980
still only seeing 720p or something like
that

224
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:51,990
that
 

225
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,070
that
all right with my homemade apparatus

226
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,080
all right with my homemade apparatus
 

227
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:10,280
all right with my homemade apparatus
because each of the two sides so I'm

228
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,290
because each of the two sides so I'm
 

229
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,460
because each of the two sides so I'm
actually pulling 2 times 4k so 4k per

230
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,470
actually pulling 2 times 4k so 4k per
 

231
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,090
actually pulling 2 times 4k so 4k per
side I get a K visual data so you know

232
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,100
side I get a K visual data so you know
 

233
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,300
side I get a K visual data so you know
is that full kite across or 4k this way

234
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,310
is that full kite across or 4k this way
 

235
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:28,580
is that full kite across or 4k this way
neither its fisheye it's it's a square

236
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:28,590
neither its fisheye it's it's a square
 

237
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,670
neither its fisheye it's it's a square
video so it's an exact square with a

238
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
video so it's an exact square with a
 

239
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,760
video so it's an exact square with a
circle in it so you have a sphere it's

240
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:34,770
circle in it so you have a sphere it's
 

241
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,830
circle in it so you have a sphere it's
spherical video so I have two of those

242
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:36,840
spherical video so I have two of those
 

243
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,020
spherical video so I have two of those
so one on each side and then I stitch

244
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,030
so one on each side and then I stitch
 

245
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,010
so one on each side and then I stitch
them together and turn them into

246
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,020
them together and turn them into
 

247
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,060
them together and turn them into
equirectangular

248
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,070
equirectangular
 

249
00:06:41,070 --> 00:07:11,620
equirectangular
so it should end up being up for lunch

250
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:11,630

 

251
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:37,550

I'm sorry what I can do though is show

252
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,560
I'm sorry what I can do though is show
 

253
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,580
I'm sorry what I can do though is show
you something it's something interesting

254
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:40,590
you something it's something interesting
 

255
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,410
you something it's something interesting
let me see if I can do this without

256
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:42,420
let me see if I can do this without
 

257
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,360
let me see if I can do this without
showing off how messy my house is now

258
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,370
showing off how messy my house is now
 

259
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,350
showing off how messy my house is now
incredibly messy my house is I don't

260
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
incredibly messy my house is I don't
 

261
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,620
incredibly messy my house is I don't
know if you can see it there we go yeah

262
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:54,630
know if you can see it there we go yeah
 

263
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,240
know if you can see it there we go yeah
this is this is if I can do this

264
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,250
this is this is if I can do this
 

265
00:07:59,250 --> 00:07:59,930
this is this is if I can do this
one-handed

266
00:07:59,930 --> 00:07:59,940
one-handed
 

267
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:19,850
one-handed
oh I'm sorry that's that's what's inside

268
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:19,860
oh I'm sorry that's that's what's inside
 

269
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,210
oh I'm sorry that's that's what's inside
it because that is my floppy disk

270
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,220
it because that is my floppy disk
 

271
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,750
it because that is my floppy disk
emulator it uses a little SD card

272
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:29,760
emulator it uses a little SD card
 

273
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,159
emulator it uses a little SD card
it's got like hundreds of of 390 K

274
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,169
it's got like hundreds of of 390 K
 

275
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:41,719
it's got like hundreds of of 390 K
images on there and if I care enough is

276
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:41,729
images on there and if I care enough is
 

277
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,460
images on there and if I care enough is
it re-approach bust

278
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,470
it re-approach bust
 

279
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,390
it re-approach bust
all the device I bought this I bought

280
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,400
all the device I bought this I bought
 

281
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,990
all the device I bought this I bought
this unit brand-new and up there it is

282
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
this unit brand-new and up there it is
 

283
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,700
this unit brand-new and up there it is
the screens come to life I don't know if

284
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:52,710
the screens come to life I don't know if
 

285
00:08:52,710 --> 00:09:00,830
the screens come to life I don't know if
you can see it but keep yes sir

286
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:00,840
you can see it but keep yes sir
 

287
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,810
you can see it but keep yes sir
it is at a pro 2x not easily seen but I

288
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:05,820
it is at a pro 2x not easily seen but I
 

289
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:16,460
it is at a pro 2x not easily seen but I
just pick an image I got a no way 2018 I

290
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,470
just pick an image I got a no way 2018 I
 

291
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,200
just pick an image I got a no way 2018 I
guess just having the old system read

292
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,210
guess just having the old system read
 

293
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,980
guess just having the old system read
that they're newer thing is good

294
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:24,990
that they're newer thing is good
 

295
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,730
that they're newer thing is good
engineering oh it took it took a bit of

296
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:28,740
engineering oh it took it took a bit of
 

297
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,610
engineering oh it took it took a bit of
jiggery-pokery to make this work so ya

298
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:31,620
jiggery-pokery to make this work so ya
 

299
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,360
jiggery-pokery to make this work so ya
can imagine yeah I'm trying to find some

300
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,370
can imagine yeah I'm trying to find some
 

301
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,220
can imagine yeah I'm trying to find some
too but there it is turbo Pascal

302
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,230
too but there it is turbo Pascal
 

303
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,080
too but there it is turbo Pascal
this will make nice this will make there

304
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,090
this will make nice this will make there
 

305
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:48,110
this will make nice this will make there
it is it booted so now I think if I

306
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,120
it is it booted so now I think if I
 

307
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,750
it is it booted so now I think if I
remember correctly oh I can't spell

308
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760

 

309
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:07,190

this will make Peter happy here I mean

what what's on these programs so let's
 

367
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:55,630
what what's on these programs so let's
have a look and see what's there let's

373
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,090
ow okay I'll pick another yeah that'll
work

374
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,100

 

375
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,520

we have your selecting your second like

your P Drive now right I'm on the bum on

378
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
your P Drive now right I'm on the bum on
 

379
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,300
your P Drive now right I'm on the bum on
the B drive now and I switched the image

380
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,310
the B drive now and I switched the image
 

381
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,550
the B drive now and I switched the image
so it's I had an image for

382
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:21,560
so it's I had an image for
 

383
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,870
so it's I had an image for
um for a program called speak but I

384
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:25,880
um for a program called speak but I
 

385
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,870
um for a program called speak but I
don't have the S P 256 chip that I need

386
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
don't have the S P 256 chip that I need
 

387
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,030
don't have the S P 256 chip that I need
to drive which is the speech the speech

388
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,040
to drive which is the speech the speech
 

389
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,230
to drive which is the speech the speech
chip what I used to have it I don't know

390
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
chip what I used to have it I don't know
 

391
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,990
chip what I used to have it I don't know
where it is when all this junk around

392
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,000
where it is when all this junk around
 

393
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,850
where it is when all this junk around
the house I just can't remember where it

394
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:42,860
the house I just can't remember where it
 

395
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,260
the house I just can't remember where it
is but I would connect the parallel port

396
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,270
is but I would connect the parallel port
 

397
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,140
is but I would connect the parallel port
to the SP 256 and then connect the

398
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,150
to the SP 256 and then connect the
 

399
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,880
to the SP 256 and then connect the
speaker to it and I could make the

400
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:51,890
speaker to it and I could make the
 

401
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,800
speaker to it and I could make the
laptop I could make the laptop I can

402
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:53,810
laptop I could make the laptop I can
 

403
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,920
laptop I could make the laptop I can
make the Cape Road actually talk I could

404
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:56,930
make the Cape Road actually talk I could
 

405
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,750
make the Cape Road actually talk I could
send it that the s P 256 has phonemes

406
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:00,760
send it that the s P 256 has phonemes
 

407
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,220
send it that the s P 256 has phonemes
inside it and you connect the phonemes

408
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,230
inside it and you connect the phonemes
 

409
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,160
inside it and you connect the phonemes
together to form words when you do speak

410
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,170
together to form words when you do speak
 

411
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,140
together to form words when you do speak
that's one way to do speech synthesis

412
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,150
that's one way to do speech synthesis
 

413
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,010
that's one way to do speech synthesis
right the phonemes are hard-coded inside

414
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,020
right the phonemes are hard-coded inside
 

415
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,610
right the phonemes are hard-coded inside
the s P 256 chip you just select which

416
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:18,620
the s P 256 chip you just select which
 

417
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,070
the s P 256 chip you just select which
ones you want and select where you want

418
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,080
ones you want and select where you want
 

419
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,680
ones you want and select where you want
the best basis to be and that's how you

420
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:26,690
the best basis to be and that's how you
 

421
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,750
the best basis to be and that's how you
form words and away you go

422
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:28,760
form words and away you go
 

423
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:41,650
form words and away you go
so not in this version no no no because

424
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:41,660
so not in this version no no no because
 

425
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,140
so not in this version no no no because
if it the phonemes are hard-coded in and

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,150
if it the phonemes are hard-coded in and
 

427
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,560
if it the phonemes are hard-coded in and

so I think you can see on the screen I
 

521
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,680
so I think you can see on the screen I
don't know if you can see it or not but

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:53,690
don't know if you can see it or not but
 

523
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,139
don't know if you can see it or not but
that's a that's absurd ad assembly

524
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:56,149
that's a that's absurd ad assembly
 

525
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,259
that's a that's absurd ad assembly
language that that I'm showing you being

assembly I could our little girl burger
yeah

532
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:08,179
yeah
 

533
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:11,740
yeah
yep but yeah that's the speak program

534
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:11,750
yep but yeah that's the speak program
 

535
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,240
yep but yeah that's the speak program
that reads text and once it reads the

536
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,250
that reads text and once it reads the
 

537
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,850
that reads text and once it reads the
text it's it stitches phonemes together

538
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:18,860
text it's it stitches phonemes together
 

539
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,189
text it's it stitches phonemes together
like you were talking about stitching 3d

540
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
like you were talking about stitching 3d
 

541
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,909
like you were talking about stitching 3d
or 360 degree photos together and then

542
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:24,919
or 360 degree photos together and then
 

543
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,620
or 360 degree photos together and then
squirts them out to the SP 256 which the

544
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:29,630
squirts them out to the SP 256 which the
 

545
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,400
squirts them out to the SP 256 which the
s P 256 will then just speak the

546
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,410
s P 256 will then just speak the
 

547
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,470
s P 256 will then just speak the
phonemes that you that you squirt at it

548
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:35,480
phonemes that you that you squirt at it
 

549
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:44,620
phonemes that you that you squirt at it
so yep I'll have to find that SP 256 or

550
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:44,630
so yep I'll have to find that SP 256 or
 

551
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,450
so yep I'll have to find that SP 256 or
I'll have to go bye-bye another one if

552
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:46,460
I'll have to go bye-bye another one if
 

553
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,150
I'll have to go bye-bye another one if
