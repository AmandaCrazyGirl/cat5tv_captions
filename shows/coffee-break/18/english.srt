00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,020
funding I don't know it's probably more
 

161
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,530
funding I don't know it's probably more
than that now but but Mycroft itself is

162
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:10,540
than that now but but Mycroft itself is
 

163
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,050
than that now but but Mycroft itself is
an open source project so any Linux

164
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,060
an open source project so any Linux
 

165
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,880
an open source project so any Linux
computer can run it including a single

166
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:14,890
computer can run it including a single
 

167
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,870
computer can run it including a single
board computer so you don't actually

168
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:17,880
board computer so you don't actually
 

169
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,500
board computer so you don't actually
yeah I'm sorry my question would be the

170
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,510
yeah I'm sorry my question would be the
 

171
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,230
yeah I'm sorry my question would be the
various digital assistants like yeah I

172
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,240
various digital assistants like yeah I
 

173
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,790
various digital assistants like yeah I
won't say them because I don't want to

174
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
won't say them because I don't want to
 

175
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,090
won't say them because I don't want to
trigger the action words but are they

176
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,100
trigger the action words but are they
 

177
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,790
trigger the action words but are they
the just Mycroft work the same way that

178
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
the just Mycroft work the same way that
 

179
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,360
the just Mycroft work the same way that
they that it has to talk to a server

180
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,370
they that it has to talk to a server
 

181
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,070
they that it has to talk to a server

luckily it's all done locally yep Wow
 

187
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,560
luckily it's all done locally yep Wow
it'll got the Internet to get

188
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,570
it'll got the Internet to get
 

189
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,990
it'll got the Internet to get
information but it won't process your

190

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:35,380
you know it's not instantaneous by any
 

221
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,999
you know it's not instantaneous by any
means and and it gets stuff wrong

222
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:39,009
means and and it gets stuff wrong
 

223
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,490

sometimes Google photos it's not but

224
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:41,500
sometimes Google photos it's not but
 

225
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,870
sometimes Google photos it's not but
it's pretty damn good

226
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
it's pretty damn good
 

227
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,120
it's pretty damn good
and it certainly pics it certainly pics

228
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,130
and it certainly pics it certainly pics
 

229
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,580

faces of people that I've got in my

230
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:50,590
faces of people that I've got in my
 

231
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,770
faces of people that I've got in my
photos from that I've been converting

232
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:52,780
photos from that I've been converting
 

233
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,180
photos from that I've been converting
from 35 millimeter film to digital and I

234
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,190
from 35 millimeter film to digital and I
 

235
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,029
from 35 millimeter film to digital and I
think it's bumping them into these the

236
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:00,039
think it's bumping them into these the
 

237
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,330
think it's bumping them into these the
moments folder in the Synology box and

238
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:03,340
moments folder in the Synology box and
 

239
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,550
moments folder in the Synology box and
it just it just categorizes them it just

240
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,560
it just it just categorizes them it just
 

241
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,189
it just it just categorizes them it just
figures it out and it's the most amazing

242
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:08,199
figures it out and it's the most amazing
 

243
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,649
figures it out and it's the most amazing
thing I've ever seen in it with

244
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:10,659
thing I've ever seen in it with
 

245
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:13,740
thing I've ever seen in it with
absolutely worth that the spending the

246
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:13,750
absolutely worth that the spending the
 

247
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,830
absolutely worth that the spending the
dollars on the Synology box because when

248
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:16,840
dollars on the Synology box because when
 

249
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,110
dollars on the Synology box because when
you convert that to the manual time it

250
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
you convert that to the manual time it
 

251
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,580
you convert that to the manual time it
would have taken for me to train

252
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:20,590
would have taken for me to train
 

253
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,330
would have taken for me to train
categorize and manually impart there's

254
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,340
categorize and manually impart there's
 

255
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,709
categorize and manually impart there's
no way I could have done it for that

256
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:25,719
no way I could have done it for that
 

257
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:29,279
no way I could have done it for that
kind of time or you know right yeah well

258
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,289
kind of time or you know right yeah well
 

259
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,170
kind of time or you know right yeah well
that's another thing about my craft is

318
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
good sound quality and still about the
 

319
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,890
good sound quality and still about the
size of you know of a cup you gotta set

size of you know of a cup you gotta set
 

321
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,600
size of you know of a cup you gotta set
up a server like what's immediately

322
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,610
up a server like what's immediately
 

323
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,190
up a server like what's immediately
coming to mind is we were thinking about

324
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
coming to mind is we were thinking about
 

325
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
coming to mind is we were thinking about
what can we do with a pine phone oh yeah

326
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,130
what can we do with a pine phone oh yeah
 

327
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,770
what can we do with a pine phone oh yeah
right as a server and they were

328
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:25,780
right as a server and they were
 

329
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,280
right as a server and they were
considering using the pine 864 B which

330
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,290
considering using the pine 864 B which
 

331
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,980
considering using the pine 864 B which
is a Raspberry Pi sized board yeah I

332
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:31,990
is a Raspberry Pi sized board yeah I
 

333
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,290
is a Raspberry Pi sized board yeah I
don't know if that's still the plan or

334
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,300
don't know if that's still the plan or
 

335
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,120
don't know if that's still the plan or
not that's the last thing we were

336
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,130
not that's the last thing we were
 

337
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:42,120
not that's the last thing we were
discussing the pine 64 H 64b is is a

338
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,130
discussing the pine 64 H 64b is is a
 

339
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,020
discussing the pine 64 H 64b is is a
pretty powerful board at a pretty good

340
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,030
pretty powerful board at a pretty good
 

341
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,700
pretty powerful board at a pretty good
price so yeah I don't know what's the

342
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:50,710
price so yeah I don't know what's the
 

343
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,670
price so yeah I don't know what's the
status right now like I said it doesn't

344
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
status right now like I said it doesn't
 

345
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,610
status right now like I said it doesn't
seem like but maybe they put on the back

346
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:56,620
seem like but maybe they put on the back

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,250
projects or bigger fish to fry
have you tried is it is it usable in its

354
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,260
have you tried is it is it usable in its
 

355
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,350
have you tried is it is it usable in its
current state yeah see - a while back

356
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,360
current state yeah see - a while back
 

357
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,700
current state yeah see - a while back
and I actually haven't like implemented

358
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,710

though the AI doesn't tell me yeah well

426
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:18,630
though the AI doesn't tell me yeah well

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,700
though the AI doesn't tell me yeah well
not only that but your phone if it's

428
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:22,710
not only that but your phone if it's
 

429
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,380
not only that but your phone if it's
logged if it's Android let's say an

435
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,810

location so they can they can pinpoint

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:32,820
location so they can they can pinpoint
 

437
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,220
location so they can they can pinpoint
exactly if the GPS is running in the

exactly if the GPS is running in the
 

439
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,430
exactly if the GPS is running in the
phone not necessarily they also did by

Wi-Fi triangulation
 

443
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,970
Wi-Fi triangulation
other methods as well but that's nowhere

444
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:43,980
other methods as well but that's nowhere
 

445
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,100
other methods as well but that's nowhere
near as accurate dark as for the

449
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,020
purposes of social distancing it's hard
to it put uh purposes of social

450
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,030

distancing it's hard to check to see if

00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,220
distancing it's hard to check to see if
 

453
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,340
distancing it's hard to check to see if
people are complain when you don't have

454
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,350
people are complain when you don't have
 

455
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,040
people are complain when you don't have
GPS and you can't even trust the GPS

456
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,050
GPS and you can't even trust the GPS

data on phones because they have a

458
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,020
data on phones because they have a
 

459
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,260
data on phones because they have a
tolerance of about two or three meters

460
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,270
tolerance of about two or three meters
 

461
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,880
tolerance of about two or three meters
so if you people are passing each other

462
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:12,890
so if you people are passing each other
 

463
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,680
so if you people are passing each other
three meters apart it can show up on the

464
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:15,690
three meters apart it can show up on the
 

465
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,410
three meters apart it can show up on the
map as if they shook hands before they

466
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:18,420
map as if they shook hands before they
 

467
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,190
map as if they shook hands before they
moved on yeah but I don't have the GPS

468
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,200
moved on yeah but I don't have the GPS
 

469
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,490
moved on yeah but I don't have the GPS
on my phone and I bought it but you

470
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:25,500
on my phone and I bought it but you
 

471
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,120
on my phone and I bought it but you
can't you can't turn it off completely

472
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,130
can't you can't turn it off completely

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,160
can't you can't turn it off completely
even though you have location services

474
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,170
even though you have location services
 

475
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,160
even though you have location services
disabled it doesn't mean that the GPS is

476
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,170
disabled it doesn't mean that the GPS is
 

477
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,940
disabled it doesn't mean that the GPS is
not working I've read a number of

478
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:37,950
not working I've read a number of
 

479
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,930
not working I've read a number of
different articles about it but it's

480
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:41,940
different articles about it but it's
 

481
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,150
different articles about it but it's
gonna be different because the toggle

482
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
gonna be different because the toggle
 

483
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,540
gonna be different because the toggle
switches yes was the pine phone you can

484
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,550
switches yes was the pine phone you can
 

485
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,160
switches yes was the pine phone you can
actually toggle things off physically

486
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,170
actually toggle things off physically
 

487
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,290
actually toggle things off physically
it's not exactly easy to do because they

488
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:51,300
it's not exactly easy to do because they
 

489
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,920
it's not exactly easy to do because they
take off the back cover let's say that

490
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:54,930
take off the back cover let's say that
 

491
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,760
take off the back cover let's say that
you don't want well first of all from

00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:58,770
you don't want well first of all from

you may be able to add those services on

508

you may be able to add those services on
 

509
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,970
you may be able to add those services on

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,810
to it but they won't have those enabled
by default so unless you load something

your location or something like that
 

517
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,790
your location or something like that
then you're not gonna have to worry

518
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
then you're not gonna have to worry
 

519
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,620
then you're not gonna have to worry
about it what many people Faraday cage

520
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:39,630
about it what many people Faraday cage
 

521
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,470
about it what many people Faraday cage

523
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
over-the-air will have got the are up in
picked up yeah but also it would also

524
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:45,690
picked up yeah but also it would also
 

525
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,900
picked up yeah but also it would also
stop your phone from working because you

526
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:47,910
stop your phone from working because you
 

527
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,100
stop your phone from working because you
won't be able to make or receive phone

528
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,110
won't be able to make or receive phone

531
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:55,350

well you can you can tune your Faraday

532
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
well you can you can tune your Faraday
 

533
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,970
well you can you can tune your Faraday
cage for different frequencies enemy of

534
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:02,980
cage for different frequencies enemy of
 

535
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:13,860
cage for different frequencies enemy of
the state from 97 they have working off

536
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:13,870
the state from 97 they have working off
 

537
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,079
the state from 97 they have working off
the grid and they in an old building

538
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,089
the grid and they in an old building
 

539
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,100
the grid and they in an old building
they built a cage full of steel bars and

540
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,110
they built a cage full of steel bars and
 

541
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,199
they built a cage full of steel bars and
they were surprised that it actually

542
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:22,209
they were surprised that it actually
 

543
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,699
they were surprised that it actually
worked

544
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:23,709
worked
 

545
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,389
worked
and they made a comment in the comment

546
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:27,399
and they made a comment in the comment
 

547
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,480
and they made a comment in the comment
section that this was the first time in

548
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,490
section that this was the first time in
 

549
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,579
section that this was the first time in
the history of using wireless

550
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:32,589
the history of using wireless
 

551
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:38,249
the history of using wireless
microphones to make movies that they

552
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:38,259
microphones to make movies that they
 

553
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,650
microphones to make movies that they
couldn't use any kind of oil as the

554
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:40,660
couldn't use any kind of oil as the
 

555
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,350
couldn't use any kind of oil as the
devices inside of the package so they

556
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
devices inside of the package so they
 

557
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,780
devices inside of the package so they
have put wires inside about this exact

558
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:48,790
have put wires inside about this exact
 

559
00:15:48,790 --> 00:16:01,650
have put wires inside about this exact
same thing they have and it all we're

560
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:01,660
same thing they have and it all we're
 

561
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,509
same thing they have and it all we're
coming from there because I had tried

562
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
coming from there because I had tried
 

563
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,780
coming from there because I had tried
petrol and say they they put I like a

564
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,790
petrol and say they they put I like a
 

565
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,749
petrol and say they they put I like a
metal like a better show dudes or the

566
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:12,759
metal like a better show dudes or the
 

567
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,230
metal like a better show dudes or the
brickwork vibe and a log bad I could try

568
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
brickwork vibe and a log bad I could try
 

569
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,840
brickwork vibe and a log bad I could try
it works too bloody well because you

570
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:18,850
it works too bloody well because you
 

571
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:25,110
it works too bloody well because you
become yeah it's like I want good signal

572
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
become yeah it's like I want good signal
 

573
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,019
become yeah it's like I want good signal
yeah I've never heard of a Faraday cage

574
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:28,029
yeah I've never heard of a Faraday cage
 

575
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,569
yeah I've never heard of a Faraday cage
being tuned I don't I didn't think that

576
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:30,579
being tuned I don't I didn't think that
 

577
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:31,319
being tuned I don't I didn't think that
was possible

578
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:31,329
was possible
 

579
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:42,179
was possible
I thought a Faraday cage alright yeah

580
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:42,189
I thought a Faraday cage alright yeah
 

581
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:45,179
I thought a Faraday cage alright yeah
okay I think you can adjust the the mesh

582
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:45,189
okay I think you can adjust the the mesh
 

583
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:59,189
okay I think you can adjust the the mesh
yeah oh I've never tried that so even if

584
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
yeah oh I've never tried that so even if
 

585
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,319
yeah oh I've never tried that so even if
one have a phone that you cannot turn

586
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:01,329
one have a phone that you cannot turn
 

587
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:04,439
one have a phone that you cannot turn
off location services with GPS if you

588
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:04,449
off location services with GPS if you
 

589
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,650
off location services with GPS if you
really want to go on

590
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:05,660
really want to go on
 

591
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,810
really want to go on
all right and you don't want anyone to

592
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:07,820
all right and you don't want anyone to
 

593
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,510
all right and you don't want anyone to
know that you're going and leave the

594
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:10,520
know that you're going and leave the
 

595
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,320
know that you're going and leave the
phone yeah exactly yeah but yeah we what

596
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:17,330
phone yeah exactly yeah but yeah we what
 

597
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,360
phone yeah exactly yeah but yeah we what
I was going to mention was that if you

598
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,370
I was going to mention was that if you
 

599
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,800
I was going to mention was that if you
decide to pursue a path of privacy

600
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:22,810
decide to pursue a path of privacy
 

601
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,470
decide to pursue a path of privacy
digital privacy and security it's an

602
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
digital privacy and security it's an
 

603
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,190
digital privacy and security it's an
uphill battle because our starting point

604
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:30,200
uphill battle because our starting point
 

605
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,670
uphill battle because our starting point
is a point of non security and non

606
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:33,680
is a point of non security and non
 

607
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,240
is a point of non security and non
privacy yeah and so you have to fight

608
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,250
privacy yeah and so you have to fight
 

609
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,010
privacy yeah and so you have to fight
every step of the way to get away from

610
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,020
every step of the way to get away from
 

611
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,650
every step of the way to get away from
that into us into a place of privacy and

612
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:41,660
that into us into a place of privacy and
 

613
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,050
that into us into a place of privacy and
security so let's say you're using a VPN

614
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,060
security so let's say you're using a VPN
 

615
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,960
security so let's say you're using a VPN
right to do some browsing on your

616
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:46,970
right to do some browsing on your
 

617
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,670
right to do some browsing on your
Android phone and let's say you want to

618
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:51,680
Android phone and let's say you want to
 

619
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,080
Android phone and let's say you want to
look up something about government

620
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,090
look up something about government
 

621
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,570
look up something about government
conspiracies or something else that

622
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:55,580
conspiracies or something else that
 

623
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,680
conspiracies or something else that
might be a trigger for agency I don't

624
00:17:59,680 --> 00:17:59,690
might be a trigger for agency I don't
 

625
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,190
might be a trigger for agency I don't
know so you log into your VPN and then

626
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
know so you log into your VPN and then
 

627
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
know so you log into your VPN and then
you start browsing well that's fine as

628
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,410
you start browsing well that's fine as
 

629
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,720
you start browsing well that's fine as

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,140
actually have a chance to act right and
and part of that is because privacy is

702
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,150
and part of that is because privacy is
 

703
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:23,430
and part of that is because privacy is
so hard to obtain on the digital web so

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,520
don't quote me on that but I have seen
some chatter about a phone on on the

788
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,530
some chatter about a phone on on the
 

789
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,820
some chatter about a phone on on the
news group or them on the chat groups so

790
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:48,830
news group or them on the chat groups so
 

791
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,350
news group or them on the chat groups so
I don't know if that's a lower-level

792
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,360
I don't know if that's a lower-level
 

793
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,960
I don't know if that's a lower-level
thing or if that's actual app I think it

794
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:52,970
thing or if that's actual app I think it
 

795
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,480
thing or if that's actual app I think it
might be the lower the lower and lower

796
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:55,490
might be the lower the lower and lower
 

797
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,180
might be the lower the lower and lower
level stuff so there's probably GUI

798
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,190
level stuff so there's probably GUI
 

799
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,820
level stuff so there's probably GUI
built on top of it I'm thinking that

800
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:00,830
built on top of it I'm thinking that
 

801
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,700
built on top of it I'm thinking that
probably the way to go would be some

802
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:03,710
probably the way to go would be some
 

803
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,000
probably the way to go would be some
kind of an intermediate service that

804
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,010
kind of an intermediate service that
 

805
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,950
kind of an intermediate service that
whoever builds the phone at whether it

806
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
whoever builds the phone at whether it
 

807
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,130
whoever builds the phone at whether it
be a phone or another app can call this

808
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,140
be a phone or another app can call this
 

809
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,900
be a phone or another app can call this
to get the contact data that they need

810
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:18,910

 

811
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,160

what's that this would be so you have

812
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,170
what's that this would be so you have
 

813
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,050
what's that this would be so you have
your own contact server so you're in

814
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,060
your own contact server so you're in
 

815
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,660
your own contact server so you're in
control of your cloud basic all I do now

I do have been doing you could take to

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:31,910
I do have been doing you could take to
 

819
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,870
I do have been doing you could take to
any card ad service I mean you could

820
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
any card ad service I mean you could
 

821
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,970
any card ad service I mean you could
cheat to your Google card dev service if

822
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:36,980
cheat to your Google card dev service if
 

823

point is though that it doesn't make

840
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,030
point is though that it doesn't make
 

841
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,090
point is though that it doesn't make
sense for all the different phone

sense for all the different phone
 

843
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,240

vCard

846
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,150
vCard
 

847
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,280
vCard
syntax you know passing a non-permanent

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,290
syntax you know passing a non-permanent
 

849
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,710
syntax you know passing a non-permanent
and passing PA RSP where the tries to

and passing PA RSP where the tries to
 

851
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,350
and passing PA RSP where the tries to
decode what the v card looks like in

decode what the v card looks like in
 

853
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,030
decode what the v card looks like in
order to mind the information out of it

order to mind the information out of it
 

855
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,700
order to mind the information out of it
and building it back up seems to me it

856
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:33,710
and building it back up seems to me it
 

857
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,100
and building it back up seems to me it
would make sense to to centralize that

858
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,110
would make sense to to centralize that
 

859
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,760
would make sense to to centralize that
into one place well be back in him just

860
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:39,770
into one place well be back in him just
 

861
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,380

immediately I'm thinking about how I

862
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,390
immediately I'm thinking about how I
 

863
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,510
immediately I'm thinking about how I
could do this with PHP you do realize

864
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:43,520
could do this with PHP you do realize
 

865
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,460
could do this with PHP you do realize
that I challenge you you go ahead and

866
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:48,470
that I challenge you you go ahead and
 

867
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,320
that I challenge you you go ahead and
build something like that with PHP I'll

868
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,330
build something like that with PHP I'll
 

869
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,330
build something like that with PHP I'll
build and Sam will see you will see

870
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:52,340
build and Sam will see you will see
 

871
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,270
build and Sam will see you will see
which one is faster which one works more

872
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,280
which one is faster which one works more
 

873
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,530
which one is faster which one works more
importantly work right you're gonna have

874
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:02,540
importantly work right you're gonna have
 

875
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,930
importantly work right you're gonna have
PHP cron jobs in no time you can anyway

876
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:07,940
PHP cron jobs in no time you can anyway
 

877
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,120
PHP cron jobs in no time you can anyway
I mean if you can run a PHP the command

878
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,130
I mean if you can run a PHP the command
 

879
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,740
I mean if you can run a PHP the command
line you've indicated you can you can

880
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:11,750
line you've indicated you can you can
 

881
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,160
line you've indicated you can you can
run it under crawl so that's oh yeah but

882
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,170
run it under crawl so that's oh yeah but
 

883
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,930
run it under crawl so that's oh yeah but
I'm thinking of a service that just

884
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:16,940
I'm thinking of a service that just
 

885
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,150
I'm thinking of a service that just
period periodically goes out and

886
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,160
period periodically goes out and
 

887
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,550
period periodically goes out and
refreshes it's in a backing store and

888
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:21,560
refreshes it's in a backing store and
 

889
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,040
refreshes it's in a backing store and
then just makes it available but it

890
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,050
then just makes it available but it
 

891
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,870
then just makes it available but it
makes me that that would be separate

892
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:25,880
makes me that that would be separate
 

893
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,690
makes me that that would be separate
from the phone oh because it would be

894
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:28,700
from the phone oh because it would be
 

895
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,950
from the phone oh because it would be
something that I would want to be able

896
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:29,960
something that I would want to be able
 

897
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,630
something that I would want to be able
to put across and when you do those

898
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:31,640
to put across and when you do those
 

899
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,550
to put across and when you do those
distros and when you look at it with a

900
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:33,560
distros and when you look at it with a
 

901
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,800
distros and when you look at it with a
regular phone it's not separate the

902
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:35,810
regular phone it's not separate the
 

903
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,780
regular phone it's not separate the
actual phone application has all that

904
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:37,790
actual phone application has all that
 

905
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,740
actual phone application has all that
embedded in it so it's got its own it's

embedded in it so it's got its own it's
 

907

there's anything like that out there and
 

915
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,160
there's anything like that out there and
that's what I wanted to ask you about if

that's what I wanted to ask you about if

companies who want to provide their who
 

927
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,330
companies who want to provide their who
normally would provide their employees

normally would provide their employees

of the phone anyway but they can provide
 

931
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,100
of the phone anyway but they can provide
them with a phone that's customized for
