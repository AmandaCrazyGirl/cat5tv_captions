544
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:19,550
bribes for some years and that figure
 

545
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,490
bribes for some years and that figure
out that I wanted some water ice and

546
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:21,500
out that I wanted some water ice and
 

547
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,760
out that I wanted some water ice and
then suddenly the controller just said I

548
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:24,770
then suddenly the controller just said I
 

549
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,620
then suddenly the controller just said I
don't want to be with you anymore so it

550
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:26,630
don't want to be with you anymore so it
 

551
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,650
don't want to be with you anymore so it
was like what do I do because I thought

552
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:29,660
was like what do I do because I thought
 

553
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,630
was like what do I do because I thought
it goes all the drives so I have to

554
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
it goes all the drives so I have to
 

555
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,300
it goes all the drives so I have to
check because I had one author and it

556
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,310
check because I had one author and it
 

557
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,210
check because I had one author and it
was like the same problem was there and

558
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:40,220
was like the same problem was there and
 

559
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,880
was like the same problem was there and
I was like six tribes dead it can't be

560
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:42,890
I was like six tribes dead it can't be
 

561
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,190
I was like six tribes dead it can't be
possible the same man yeah yeah right

562
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
possible the same man yeah yeah right
 

563
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,900
possible the same man yeah yeah right
but here's the question

564
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:46,910
but here's the question
 

565
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,289
but here's the question
when

566
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:47,299
when
 

567
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,950
when
the drive is part of a raid array how do

568
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
the drive is part of a raid array how do
 

569
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,159
the drive is part of a raid array how do
you check the drive without damaging any

570
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:54,169
you check the drive without damaging any
 

571
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,269
you check the drive without damaging any
of the data on the drive I guess you can

572
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:58,279
of the data on the drive I guess you can
 

573
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,759
of the data on the drive I guess you can
check the drive individually like the

574
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:00,769
check the drive individually like the
 

575
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:01,210
check the drive individually like the
smokes

576
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:01,220
smokes
 

577
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,979
smokes
you know it's also yeah you know what I

578
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:02,989
you know it's also yeah you know what I
 

579
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:04,810
you know it's also yeah you know what I
would do be p9 in a case like that is

580
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:04,820
would do be p9 in a case like that is
 

581
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,680
would do be p9 in a case like that is
I've been plugging it into an imager and

582
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:07,690
I've been plugging it into an imager and
 

583
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,899
I've been plugging it into an imager and
checking the sectors like see see the

584
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:10,909
checking the sectors like see see the
 

585
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:13,450
checking the sectors like see see the
smart codes and then also see if there's

586
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:13,460
smart codes and then also see if there's
 

587
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,539
smart codes and then also see if there's
any any bad sectors that are causing a

588
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:16,549
any any bad sectors that are causing a
 

589
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:20,379
any any bad sectors that are causing a
failure now it's not like you could plug

590
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:20,389
failure now it's not like you could plug
 

591
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:22,989
failure now it's not like you could plug
it in as a second drive on a Linux box

592
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:22,999
it in as a second drive on a Linux box
 

593
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,099
it in as a second drive on a Linux box
or something because it wouldn't be

594
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:24,109
or something because it wouldn't be
 

595
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,099
or something because it wouldn't be
mountable with it but you could you

596
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:27,109
mountable with it but you could you
 

597
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,749
mountable with it but you could you
could check the integrity of the drive

598
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:28,759
could check the integrity of the drive
 

599
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,879
could check the integrity of the drive
and you could damage it to a second

600
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:30,889
and you could damage it to a second
 

601
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:33,369
and you could damage it to a second
drive and then if you're able to make a

602
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:33,379
drive and then if you're able to make a
 

603
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,940
drive and then if you're able to make a
successful DD for example to India they

604
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:36,950
successful DD for example to India they
 

605
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,919
successful DD for example to India they
don't be able to insert that that

606
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:38,929
don't be able to insert that that
 

607
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,549
don't be able to insert that that
recovered copy into the array and reboot

608
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
recovered copy into the array and reboot
 

609
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,340
recovered copy into the array and reboot
the array and presume and a drive that

610
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,350
the array and presume and a drive that
 

611
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:52,869
the array and presume and a drive that
is at least as big yeah yeah yeah and in

612
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:52,879
is at least as big yeah yeah yeah and in
 

613
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:55,299
is at least as big yeah yeah yeah and in
this case - I seem to recall like the

614
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:55,309
this case - I seem to recall like the
 

615
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,979
this case - I seem to recall like the
assumption was that it was a drive issue

616
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:56,989
assumption was that it was a drive issue
 

617
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,989
assumption was that it was a drive issue
but then it turned it it turned out to

618
00:18:58,989 --> 00:18:58,999
but then it turned it it turned out to
 

619
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,989
but then it turned it it turned out to
be a controller which you know at that

620
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:01,999
be a controller which you know at that
 

621
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,299
be a controller which you know at that
point it's like oh man you've gone to so

622
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:04,309
point it's like oh man you've gone to so
 

623
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:13,919
point it's like oh man you've gone to so
much amble didn't scrambled out yeah and

624
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:13,929
much amble didn't scrambled out yeah and
 

625
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,779
much amble didn't scrambled out yeah and
what do you do if you've got dual Drive

626
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:16,789
what do you do if you've got dual Drive
 

627
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,340
what do you do if you've got dual Drive
fault tolerance and it shows that you've

628
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,350
fault tolerance and it shows that you've
 

629
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:30,720
fault tolerance and it shows that you've
lost six for our data storage yeah I

630
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:30,730
lost six for our data storage yeah I
 

631
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,479
lost six for our data storage yeah I
have our server has eight drives which

632
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:34,489
have our server has eight drives which
 

633
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:40,539
have our server has eight drives which
are broken into two arrays and then I

634
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:40,549
are broken into two arrays and then I
 

635
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:42,340
are broken into two arrays and then I
have an external what's called an a raid

636
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,350
have an external what's called an a raid
 

637
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,609
have an external what's called an a raid
3500 and that is a raid

638
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:45,619
3500 and that is a raid
 

639
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,149
3500 and that is a raid
1 essentially it mimics a raid 1 but

640
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:49,159
1 essentially it mimics a raid 1 but
 

641
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:51,159
1 essentially it mimics a raid 1 but
it's a hardware device that you can

642
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:51,169
it's a hardware device that you can
 

643
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,609
it's a hardware device that you can
eject the second drive at will and take

644
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:54,619
eject the second drive at will and take
 

645
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,710
eject the second drive at will and take
that off-site and that's your like your

646
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
that off-site and that's your like your
 

647
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,320
that off-site and that's your like your
off-site backup and it just rebuilds

648
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,330
off-site backup and it just rebuilds
 

649
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,120
off-site backup and it just rebuilds
anytime you insert a new drive so

650
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,130
anytime you insert a new drive so
 

651
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,400
anytime you insert a new drive so
constantly every week I swap that drive

652
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,410
constantly every week I swap that drive
 

653
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,630
constantly every week I swap that drive
and that has 10 terabyte drives in it so

654
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:07,640
and that has 10 terabyte drives in it so
 

655
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,420
and that has 10 terabyte drives in it so
so my external backup the thing that I

656
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:10,430
so my external backup the thing that I
 

657
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,000
so my external backup the thing that I
take off-site is Luke's encrypted and it

658
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,010
take off-site is Luke's encrypted and it
 

659
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,250
take off-site is Luke's encrypted and it
has 10 terabytes of storage so basically

660
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:15,260
has 10 terabytes of storage so basically
 

661
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,460
has 10 terabytes of storage so basically
more than enough space for all our video

662
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,470
more than enough space for all our video
 

663
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,840
more than enough space for all our video
and the arrays in the server are

664
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:21,850
and the arrays in the server are
 

665
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,700
and the arrays in the server are
constantly backed up to that just how

666
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:24,710
constantly backed up to that just how
 

667
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,770
constantly backed up to that just how
long does it take to rebuild that 10

668
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:26,780
long does it take to rebuild that 10
 

669
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,090
long does it take to rebuild that 10
terabytes drive yeah put a new one in it

670
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:31,100
terabytes drive yeah put a new one in it
 

671
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,800
terabytes drive yeah put a new one in it
must take some time to read it would

672
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:32,810
must take some time to read it would
 

673
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,750
must take some time to read it would
because it's a sector-by-sector rebuild

674
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:34,760
because it's a sector-by-sector rebuild
 

675
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,600
because it's a sector-by-sector rebuild
which is annoying I think about the the

676
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:37,610
which is annoying I think about the the
 

677
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,010
which is annoying I think about the the
wear and tear on the drives and

678
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,020
wear and tear on the drives and
 

679
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,140
wear and tear on the drives and
technically that's not the best scenario

680
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,150
technically that's not the best scenario
 

681
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,290
technically that's not the best scenario
but it works and yet I've yet to fail a

682
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:44,300
but it works and yet I've yet to fail a
 

683
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,910
but it works and yet I've yet to fail a
drive because I use an ass drives in

684
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:45,920
drive because I use an ass drives in
 

685
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,620
drive because I use an ass drives in
there so they're they're meant to be

686
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:47,630
there so they're they're meant to be
 

687
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,460
there so they're they're meant to be
running all the time but honestly I

688
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:51,470
running all the time but honestly I
 

689
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,590
running all the time but honestly I
can't answer that because what I do is I

690
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
can't answer that because what I do is I
 

691
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,020
can't answer that because what I do is I
swap it at the end of the night and then

692
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,030
swap it at the end of the night and then
 

693
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,750
swap it at the end of the night and then
I take it home so by the time I'm there

694
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:58,760
I take it home so by the time I'm there
 

695
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,710
I take it home so by the time I'm there
next time it's already done it takes

696
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
next time it's already done it takes
 

697
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,040
next time it's already done it takes
many many hours it must be especially 10

698
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,050
many many hours it must be especially 10
 

699
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:13,150
many many hours it must be especially 10
terabytes my fault terabyte drive was

700
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,160
terabytes my fault terabyte drive was
 

701
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,770
terabytes my fault terabyte drive was
like it was like insert a new drive and

702
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:17,780
like it was like insert a new drive and
 

703
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,660
like it was like insert a new drive and
just go to sleep and was like oh yeah

704
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:22,670
just go to sleep and was like oh yeah
 

705
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,090
just go to sleep and was like oh yeah
what I do like about the a rate device

706
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,100
what I do like about the a rate device
 

707
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,470
what I do like about the a rate device
though is that it is because it's

708
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
though is that it is because it's
 

709
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,600
though is that it is because it's
external hardware it's not depending on

710
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:28,610
external hardware it's not depending on
 

711
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,990
external hardware it's not depending on
the bus or the CPU of the server so it's

712
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
the bus or the CPU of the server so it's
 

713
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,420
the bus or the CPU of the server so it's
completely separate from that so when

714
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,430
completely separate from that so when
 

715
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,400
completely separate from that so when
you put in the new drive it's running

716
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,410
you put in the new drive it's running
 

717
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,860
you put in the new drive it's running
it's able to rebuild that drive at full

718
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:38,870
it's able to rebuild that drive at full
 

719
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,790
it's able to rebuild that drive at full
SATA 3 space though so you're not having

720
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:42,800
SATA 3 space though so you're not having
 

721
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,650
SATA 3 space though so you're not having
to go through any controller or anything

722
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:44,660
to go through any controller or anything
 

723
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,020
to go through any controller or anything
like that it's just a direct rebuild in

724
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,030
like that it's just a direct rebuild in
 

725
00:21:47,030 --> 00:22:07,230
like that it's just a direct rebuild in
the unit itself so I guess it was like

726
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,240
the unit itself so I guess it was like
 

727
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:14,870
the unit itself so I guess it was like
45 tarah yeah oh how do you back up

728
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
45 tarah yeah oh how do you back up
 

729
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
45 tarah yeah oh how do you back up
that's the question is how do you back

730
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:16,650
that's the question is how do you back
 

731
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:24,580
that's the question is how do you back
up 45 terabytes I think you said 25 25

732
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,590

 

733
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:55,940

yes he said about 110 total terabyte

734
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:55,950
yes he said about 110 total terabyte
 

735
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:05,450
yes he said about 110 total terabyte
storage and yes allocated almost only

736
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:05,460
storage and yes allocated almost only
 

737
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,730
storage and yes allocated almost only
told me to like start watching stuff and

738
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:07,740
told me to like start watching stuff and
 

739
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,580
told me to like start watching stuff and
not like yeah so so how do you back all

740
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:13,590
not like yeah so so how do you back all
 

741
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,770
not like yeah so so how do you back all
that up I mean I also have a RAID

742
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:15,780
that up I mean I also have a RAID
 

743
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,660
that up I mean I also have a RAID
storage but but I back that up on a on a

744
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:20,670
storage but but I back that up on a on a
 

745
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,760
storage but but I back that up on a on a
separate I have two separate ten

746
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,770
separate I have two separate ten
 

747
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,460
separate I have two separate ten
terabyte drives that I swap out when I

748
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:25,470
terabyte drives that I swap out when I
 

749
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,730
terabyte drives that I swap out when I
back them up I back up to one then the

750
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:28,740
back them up I back up to one then the
 

751
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,260
back them up I back up to one then the
next week I swap it out and back up to

752
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,270
next week I swap it out and back up to
 

753
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,970
next week I swap it out and back up to
the other and then the next week I swap

754
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:31,980
the other and then the next week I swap
 

755
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,730
the other and then the next week I swap
it out so it's constantly rotating the

756
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:34,740
it out so it's constantly rotating the
 

757
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,850
it out so it's constantly rotating the
backup drives but 10 terabytes just

758
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:37,860
backup drives but 10 terabytes just
 

759
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,100
backup drives but 10 terabytes just
enough for me to store everything that

760
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,110
enough for me to store everything that
 

761
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,180
enough for me to store everything that
I've got on my on my raid box a minute I

762
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,190
I've got on my on my raid box a minute I
 

763
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,010
I've got on my on my raid box a minute I
do that with a hundred terabytes or 40

764
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,020
do that with a hundred terabytes or 40
 

765
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,540
do that with a hundred terabytes or 40
terabytes or anything like that it's

766
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:47,550
terabytes or anything like that it's
 

767
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:59,050
terabytes or anything like that it's
yeah I've been praying about what cloud

768
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,060

 

769
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:08,390

yeah I've not heard of that but they

770
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
yeah I've not heard of that but they
 

771
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,230
yeah I've not heard of that but they
like decrease the upload so it's like

772
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
like decrease the upload so it's like
 

773
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,170
like decrease the upload so it's like
taking slow time but it doesn't cost

774
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:15,180
taking slow time but it doesn't cost
 

775
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:22,520
taking slow time but it doesn't cost
that much I need to back it up somewhere

776
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:22,530
that much I need to back it up somewhere
 

777
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,350
that much I need to back it up somewhere
and tonight buy another pair of

778
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,360
and tonight buy another pair of
 

779
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,490
and tonight buy another pair of
too much

780
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:28,500
too much
 

781
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,270
too much
I wonder if I add a duplication and a

782
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,280
I wonder if I add a duplication and a
 

783
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,010
I wonder if I add a duplication and a
sector level would assist with that kind

784
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,020
sector level would assist with that kind
 

785
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,080
sector level would assist with that kind
of data like if you were to take sector

786
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,090
of data like if you were to take sector
 

787
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,360
of data like if you were to take sector
by sector deduplication you could

788
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,370
by sector deduplication you could
 

789
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,280
by sector deduplication you could
probably create some kind of a parity

790
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,290
probably create some kind of a parity
 

791
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,170
probably create some kind of a parity
environment between two drives that

792
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:42,180
environment between two drives that
 

793
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,740
environment between two drives that
could rebuild a lot of the data but this

794
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:45,750
could rebuild a lot of the data but this
 

795
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,530
could rebuild a lot of the data but this
is online the backup exactly that would

796
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:51,540
is online the backup exactly that would
 

797
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,430
is online the backup exactly that would
be brutal

798
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:52,440
be brutal
 

799
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,720
be brutal
that would be brutal guys I can help you

800
00:24:59,720 --> 00:24:59,730
that would be brutal guys I can help you
 

801
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,840
that would be brutal guys I can help you
with that

802
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:04,850

 

803
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,360

this will start out and back it up on

804
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:08,370
this will start out and back it up on
 

805
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:21,620
this will start out and back it up on
other things yeah I got coax here in the

806
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:21,630
other things yeah I got coax here in the
 

807
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:29,950
other things yeah I got coax here in the
states I'm getting 900 down and 50 up

808
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:29,960
states I'm getting 900 down and 50 up
 

809
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,390
states I'm getting 900 down and 50 up
not bad at all yeah I'm quite pleased

810
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
not bad at all yeah I'm quite pleased
 

811
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:40,390
not bad at all yeah I'm quite pleased
with that

812
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400

 

813
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,900

that's still pretty good

814
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:46,910

 

815
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,530

that's not too bad either 60 and 10 if

816
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:51,540
that's not too bad either 60 and 10 if
 

817
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,260
that's not too bad either 60 and 10 if
it's behaving yeah and if you're just

818
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,270
it's behaving yeah and if you're just
 

819
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,840
it's behaving yeah and if you're just
like I do i do broadcasting right so I

820
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,850
like I do i do broadcasting right so I
 

821
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,760
like I do i do broadcasting right so I
need that upstream kind of like Eric

822
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:58,770
need that upstream kind of like Eric
 

823
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:04,160
need that upstream kind of like Eric
needs it for bad enough is I made this

824
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,170
needs it for bad enough is I made this
 

825
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,020
needs it for bad enough is I made this
point yesterday or whenever it was a

826
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,030
point yesterday or whenever it was a
 

827
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,120
point yesterday or whenever it was a
couple of days ago that I might data

828
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,130
couple of days ago that I might data
 

829
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,540
couple of days ago that I might data
stays on my network on my devices yeah

830
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:11,550
stays on my network on my devices yeah
 

831
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,190
stays on my network on my devices yeah
so then in that case vp9 I'd be looking

832
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,200
so then in that case vp9 I'd be looking
 

833
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,430
so then in that case vp9 I'd be looking
at a dual raid set up like a raid six

834
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
at a dual raid set up like a raid six
 

835
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,090
at a dual raid set up like a raid six
plus one for example and you write

836
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,100
plus one for example and you write
 

837
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,170
plus one for example and you write
there's no backup

838
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,180
there's no backup
 

839
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:31,700
there's no backup
right isn't backup plus 1 6 plus

840
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,710
right isn't backup plus 1 6 plus
 

841
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,160
right isn't backup plus 1 6 plus
magnitude so you basically have to raid

842
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,170
magnitude so you basically have to raid
 

843
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,160
magnitude so you basically have to raid
6 units both of them mirrored to one

844
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,170
6 units both of them mirrored to one
 

845
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,380
6 units both of them mirrored to one
another and you take the five or six

846
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,390
another and you take the five or six
 

847
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,240
another and you take the five or six
drives out the second one

848
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,250
drives out the second one
 

849
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,340
drives out the second one
every week and you put them in a case

850
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,350
every week and you put them in a case
 

851
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,200
every week and you put them in a case
and you put in the other drives and

852
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,210
and you put in the other drives and
 

853
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,530
and you put in the other drives and
reboot the server and it comes yeah

854
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:47,540
reboot the server and it comes yeah
 

855
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,790
reboot the server and it comes yeah
right that's really the only way you can

856
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:49,800
right that's really the only way you can
 

857
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,240
right that's really the only way you can
do it yeah yeah why don't you think I'm

858
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,250
do it yeah yeah why don't you think I'm
 

859
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:58,340
do it yeah yeah why don't you think I'm
thinking robos yeah deposit box and run

860
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,350
thinking robos yeah deposit box and run
 

861
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,220
thinking robos yeah deposit box and run
them back and forth right right but

862
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,230
them back and forth right right but
 

863
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,690
them back and forth right right but
that's a pain in the butt to go to the

864
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:02,700
that's a pain in the butt to go to the
 

865
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,140
that's a pain in the butt to go to the
safe deposit box every week it's already

866
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,150
safe deposit box every week it's already
 

867
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,030
safe deposit box every week it's already
it's already a pain in the butt to back

868
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,040
it's already a pain in the butt to back
 

869
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,230
it's already a pain in the butt to back
it up every week do it but it's just a

870
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
it up every week do it but it's just a
 

871
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,000
it up every week do it but it's just a
little flight box I got a nice little

872
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,010
little flight box I got a nice little
 

873
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,070
little flight box I got a nice little
flight box that has slots for three and

874
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,080
flight box that has slots for three and
 

875
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,770
flight box that has slots for three and
a half inch drives and and so that helps

876
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:21,780
a half inch drives and and so that helps
 

877
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,680
a half inch drives and and so that helps
with that kind of backup speaking of

878
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:24,690
with that kind of backup speaking of
 

879
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,770
with that kind of backup speaking of
backups one thing that I think that most

880
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:27,780
backups one thing that I think that most
 

881
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,660
backups one thing that I think that most
people do it is a good thing to do but

882
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:29,670
people do it is a good thing to do but
 

883
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:34,550
people do it is a good thing to do but
you need to consider today many people

884
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:34,560
you need to consider today many people
 

885
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,850
you need to consider today many people
have two or more computers a friend of

886
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:37,860
have two or more computers a friend of
 

887
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,160
have two or more computers a friend of
mine one of my best friend's he told me

888
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,170
mine one of my best friend's he told me
 

889
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,230
mine one of my best friend's he told me
about his neighbor this is 20 years ago

890
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,240
about his neighbor this is 20 years ago
 

891
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,970
about his neighbor this is 20 years ago
and he had three laptops with XP on them

892
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:46,980
and he had three laptops with XP on them
 

893
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,460
and he had three laptops with XP on them
and he had configured everyone to make

894
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:49,470
and he had configured everyone to make
 

895
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,770
and he had configured everyone to make
backups of everything to the other two

896
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:51,780
backups of everything to the other two
 

897
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,870
backups of everything to the other two
laptops so he had the three copies or

898
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:53,880
laptops so he had the three copies or
 

899
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,930
laptops so he had the three copies or
everything and then one night one day

900
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:56,940
everything and then one night one day
 

901
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,640
everything and then one night one day
there the house was stuck and the power

902
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:01,650
there the house was stuck and the power
 

903
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,110
there the house was stuck and the power
cables were stuck by lightning and it

904
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
cables were stuck by lightning and it
 

905
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,440
cables were stuck by lightning and it
fried all three so everything so if you

906
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,450
fried all three so everything so if you
 

907
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,560
fried all three so everything so if you
need to have back at least one of the

908
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:09,570
need to have back at least one of the
 

909
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,950
need to have back at least one of the
backups need to always be not connected

910
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
backups need to always be not connected
 

911
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,530
backups need to always be not connected
to anything to have it for those who are

912
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:18,540
to anything to have it for those who are
 

913
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,390
to anything to have it for those who are
swapping drives you have their three

914
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:20,400
swapping drives you have their three
 

915
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,680
swapping drives you have their three
drives so you have at least one that is

916
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:24,690
drives so you have at least one that is
 

917
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,950
drives so you have at least one that is
not connected to anything that's what I

918
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:27,960
not connected to anything that's what I
 

919
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,810
not connected to anything that's what I
say I'm sorry but it's a try yeah for

920
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:32,820
say I'm sorry but it's a try yeah for
 

921
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,980
say I'm sorry but it's a try yeah for
the number of times that I've heard

922
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:33,990
the number of times that I've heard
 

923
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,200
the number of times that I've heard
somebody who brought in a computer and a

924
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,210
somebody who brought in a computer and a
 

925
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,820
somebody who brought in a computer and a
backup Drive and said here's my backup

926
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:39,830
backup Drive and said here's my backup
 

927
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,440
backup Drive and said here's my backup
they both got fried because the backup

928
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,450
they both got fried because the backup
 

929
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,060
they both got fried because the backup
is just a USB hard drinking right so

930
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,070
is just a USB hard drinking right so
 

931
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,830
is just a USB hard drinking right so
yeah you gotta air-gap that thing so
