things I think in-person conferences are
 

933
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:00,159
things I think in-person conferences are
currently not something I should be

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:00,169
currently not something I should be
 

935
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:03,159
currently not something I should be
investing in it yeah true enough well

936
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:03,169
investing in it yeah true enough well
 

937
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:04,329
investing in it yeah true enough well
it's a good time to be asking

938
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:04,339
it's a good time to be asking
 

939
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,190
it's a good time to be asking
communities hey what's the best way to

June and who knows what that's gonna
happen

954
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:21,499
happen
 

955
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:25,699
happen
the good thing about this is that now

956
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:25,709
the good thing about this is that now
 

957
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:31,609
the good thing about this is that now
all the video solutions are really

958
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:31,619
all the video solutions are really
 

959
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,509
all the video solutions are really
putting being and the people are going

960
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:35,519
putting being and the people are going
 

961
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,569
putting being and the people are going
to discover a lot of solutions and that

962
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:38,579
to discover a lot of solutions and that
 

963
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:42,649
to discover a lot of solutions and that
is finding out what solutions who

964
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:42,659
is finding out what solutions who
 

965
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:50,779
is finding out what solutions who
absolutely just suck my concern with

966
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:50,789
absolutely just suck my concern with
 

967
00:23:50,789 --> 00:24:02,690
absolutely just suck my concern with
setting it up good what were you gonna

968
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:02,700
setting it up good what were you gonna
 

969
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,940
setting it up good what were you gonna
say Bell you're my concern with with

970
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:04,950
say Bell you're my concern with with
 

971
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,919
say Bell you're my concern with with
setting it up with on the h2 with Debian

972
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:06,929
setting it up with on the h2 with Debian
 

973
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,899
setting it up with on the h2 with Debian
was the logic tech camera I didn't know

974
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:08,909
was the logic tech camera I didn't know
 

975
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:11,419
was the logic tech camera I didn't know
the logic tech would work I got a c920

976
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:11,429
the logic tech would work I got a c920
 

977
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:14,239
the logic tech would work I got a c920
and it worked immediately just work box

978
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:14,249
and it worked immediately just work box
 

979
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:15,409
and it worked immediately just work box
not yeah it looks great

980
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:15,419
not yeah it looks great
 

981
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,899
not yeah it looks great
well the 920 is also have some hardware

982
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:17,909
well the 920 is also have some hardware
 

983
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:19,279
well the 920 is also have some hardware
decoding which is why you'd want to use

984
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,289
decoding which is why you'd want to use
 

985
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:22,009
decoding which is why you'd want to use
them so hopefully make it a little

986
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:22,019
them so hopefully make it a little
 

987
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,569
them so hopefully make it a little
easier on the processor inside and I

988
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:23,579
easier on the processor inside and I
 

989
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,719
easier on the processor inside and I
have the one that I'm coming in on now

990
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:26,729
have the one that I'm coming in on now
 

991
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:30,440
have the one that I'm coming in on now
is a 920 and I thought the room camera

992
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,450
is a 920 and I thought the room camera
 

993
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,599
is a 920 and I thought the room camera
here the wide shot of the room is also a

994
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:32,609
here the wide shot of the room is also a
 

995
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:38,359
here the wide shot of the room is also a
920 there that's I'm not fighting the

996
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:38,369
920 there that's I'm not fighting the
 

997
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:41,029
920 there that's I'm not fighting the
problem is the cameras right above the

998
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
problem is the cameras right above the
 

999
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,659
problem is the cameras right above the
monitor and I keep knocking it off

1000
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:44,669

 

1001
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,639

mostly because I converted this to a

1002
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:46,649
mostly because I converted this to a
 

1003
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,649
mostly because I converted this to a
standing desk so every time I come it's

1004
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:48,659
standing desk so every time I come it's
 

1005
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,060
standing desk so every time I come it's
a manual standing desk every time I

1006
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,070
a manual standing desk every time I
 

1007
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,009
a manual standing desk every time I
crank it up the camera gets out of

1008
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:52,019
crank it up the camera gets out of
 

1009
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,549
crank it up the camera gets out of
alignment right oh yeah I said we can

1010
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:55,559
alignment right oh yeah I said we can
 

1011
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:00,219
alignment right oh yeah I said we can
see you now there he is I have a light

1012
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:00,229

 

1013
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:03,680

yes someday I will master video

1014
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:03,690
yes someday I will master video
 

1015
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,129
yes someday I will master video
production I think what was it like oh

1016
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:07,139
production I think what was it like oh
 

1017
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,139
production I think what was it like oh

mine have a nexus or running at home and
 

1047
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,880
mine have a nexus or running at home and
here he is the one who lost 44 terabytes

1048
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:19,890
here he is the one who lost 44 terabytes
 

1049
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,210
here he is the one who lost 44 terabytes
of data because of the it turns out it

1050
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,220
of data because of the it turns out it
 

1051
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,240
of data because of the it turns out it
was a controller that failed and if you

1052
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,250
was a controller that failed and if you
 

1053
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,470
was a controller that failed and if you
had just replaced control the card oh no

1054
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:29,480
had just replaced control the card oh no
 

1055
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,750
had just replaced control the card oh no
God so you went through all that

1056
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:32,760
God so you went through all that
 

1057
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,700
God so you went through all that
rigmarole thinking it was a drive issue

1058
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:34,710
rigmarole thinking it was a drive issue
 

1059
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:47,060
rigmarole thinking it was a drive issue
yeah as part of his job is fixing rate

1060
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,070
yeah as part of his job is fixing rate
 

1061
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,159
yeah as part of his job is fixing rate
there were problems as a part with work

1062
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:49,169
there were problems as a part with work
 

1063
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:54,890
there were problems as a part with work
and here and then five out of the then

1064
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:54,900
and here and then five out of the then
 

1065
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,919
and here and then five out of the then
half the drives whether a him maybe you

1066
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:00,929
half the drives whether a him maybe you
 

1067
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,960
half the drives whether a him maybe you
should try an another controller card so

1068
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:02,970
should try an another controller card so
 

1069
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,240
should try an another controller card so
he had to fork out I think he used

1070
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,250
he had to fork out I think he used
 

1071
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:13,730
he had to fork out I think he used
thousand dollars for new card so I try

1072
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:13,740
thousand dollars for new card so I try
 

1073
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,909
thousand dollars for new card so I try
very hard to make all of my arrays

1074
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
very hard to make all of my arrays
 

1075
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,060
very hard to make all of my arrays
Hardware agnostic and if I can't do that

1076
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,070
Hardware agnostic and if I can't do that
 

1077
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,970
Hardware agnostic and if I can't do that
I at least have a backup like the

1078
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:22,980
I at least have a backup like the
 

1079
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,680
I at least have a backup like the
category-five studio here it's

1080
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:24,690
category-five studio here it's
 

1081
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,549
category-five studio here it's
controller specific our server but I

1082
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
controller specific our server but I
 

1083
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,560
controller specific our server but I
have an external drive that has two

1084
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:30,570
have an external drive that has two
 

1085
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,700
have an external drive that has two
drives in a raid array and he's also a

1086
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:34,710
drives in a raid array and he's also a
 

1087
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:41,950
drives in a raid array and he's also a
Hardware agnostic but here he has

1088
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:41,960

 

1089
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,450

how many um it was a big array so you

1090
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:47,460
how many um it was a big array so you
 

1091
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,590
how many um it was a big array so you
wouldn't be able to back that up like

1092
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:48,600
wouldn't be able to back that up like
 

1093
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,570
wouldn't be able to back that up like
I've got like a six team arrives Wow

1094
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:52,580
I've got like a six team arrives Wow
 

1095
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,080
I've got like a six team arrives Wow
eight drives he has a hundred and ten

1096
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,090
eight drives he has a hundred and ten
 

1097
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,239
eight drives he has a hundred and ten
terabytes of total storage yeah Wow

1098
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:01,249
terabytes of total storage yeah Wow
 

1099
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,889
terabytes of total storage yeah Wow
when this problem started he had there

1100
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:03,899
when this problem started he had there
 

1101
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:08,869
when this problem started he had there
only forty four terabytes and it is

1102
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:08,879
only forty four terabytes and it is
 

1103
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:14,479
only forty four terabytes and it is
almost completely full over TV and I've

1104
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:14,489
almost completely full over TV and I've
 

1105
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,029
almost completely full over TV and I've
done a ripping project so I will

1106
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
done a ripping project so I will
 

1107
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,499
done a ripping project so I will
probably fill mine up and have to

1108
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:18,509
probably fill mine up and have to
 

1109
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:20,090
probably fill mine up and have to
upgrade it at some point but I think I'm

1110
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,100
upgrade it at some point but I think I'm
 

1111
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,830
upgrade it at some point but I think I'm
going until I run out of space right now

1112
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:26,840
going until I run out of space right now
 

1113
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,269
going until I run out of space right now
remember when no one was gonna need more

1114
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
remember when no one was gonna need more
 

1115
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,859
remember when no one was gonna need more
than the Commodore 64 K that reminds me

1116
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:36,869
than the Commodore 64 K that reminds me
 

1117
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:42,399
than the Commodore 64 K that reminds me
of the famous gate statement that the

1118
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:42,409
of the famous gate statement that the
 

1119
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:44,859
of the famous gate statement that the
640 cage would be enough for everyone

1120
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:44,869
640 cage would be enough for everyone
 

1121
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:47,659
640 cage would be enough for everyone
what most people do not understand is

1122
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:47,669
what most people do not understand is
 

1123
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:51,080
what most people do not understand is
that at the time he said that the normal

1124
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,090
that at the time he said that the normal
 

1125
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:57,799
that at the time he said that the normal
RAM size was 64 K he had 640 K for a few

1126
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:57,809
RAM size was 64 K he had 640 K for a few
 

1127
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,019
RAM size was 64 K he had 640 K for a few
years that was you know for everyone but

1128
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:00,029
years that was you know for everyone but
 

1129
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,099
years that was you know for everyone but
you know I always thought his statement

1130
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:04,109
you know I always thought his statement
 

1131
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:11,090
you know I always thought his statement
was 64 K not 640 K it was six forty yes

1132
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:11,100
was 64 K not 640 K it was six forty yes
 

1133
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,560
was 64 K not 640 K it was six forty yes
yeah back then that was like extended

1134
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:15,570
yeah back then that was like extended
 

1135
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,409
yeah back then that was like extended
memory and I remember trying to push

1136
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:18,419
memory and I remember trying to push
 

1137
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,169
memory and I remember trying to push
that envelope as soon as like well we

1138
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:21,179
that envelope as soon as like well we
 

1139
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,830
that envelope as soon as like well we
were using like QE mm 386 and all that

1140
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:24,840
were using like QE mm 386 and all that
 

1141
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,249
were using like QE mm 386 and all that
kind of stuff to make it work I can top

1142
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:28,259
kind of stuff to make it work I can top
 

1143
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:33,129
kind of stuff to make it work I can top
that I started working with punch cards

1144
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:33,139

 

1145
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:36,289

my dad used to work with punch cards we

1146
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:36,299
my dad used to work with punch cards we
 

1147
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,669
my dad used to work with punch cards we
used to go when I was a kid we used to

1148
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
used to go when I was a kid we used to
 

1149
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,139
used to go when I was a kid we used to
go to his office for Christmas the

1150
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:39,149
go to his office for Christmas the
 

1151
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:41,749
go to his office for Christmas the
Christmas party and our gifts always had

1152
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:41,759
Christmas party and our gifts always had
 

1153
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,609
Christmas party and our gifts always had
our name and punch card on them as the

1154
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:43,619
our name and punch card on them as the
 

1155
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:47,450
our name and punch card on them as the
tag I didn't use punch cards but I did

1156
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:47,460
tag I didn't use punch cards but I did
 

1157
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,080
tag I didn't use punch cards but I did
have to use coding sheets for COBOL

1158
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,090
have to use coding sheets for COBOL
 

1159
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,950
have to use coding sheets for COBOL
programs spec industry we had a colas

1160
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
programs spec industry we had a colas
 

1161
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,910
programs spec industry we had a colas
and worry about going yeah my dad had a

1162
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:58,920
and worry about going yeah my dad had a
 

1163
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,450
and worry about going yeah my dad had a
speech in in a History Society

1164
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:04,460
speech in in a History Society
 

1165
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,790
speech in in a History Society
Association in in the states I think

1166
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:07,800
Association in in the states I think
 

1167
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,060
Association in in the states I think
this was 20 years ago about the history

1168
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,070
this was 20 years ago about the history
 

1169
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,200
this was 20 years ago about the history
of Linux and he started way back when

1170
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,210
of Linux and he started way back when
 

1171
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,070
of Linux and he started way back when
his father got the first computer

1172
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,080
his father got the first computer
 

1173
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,480
his father got the first computer
Sinclair something what a civics ID or

1174
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:23,490
Sinclair something what a civics ID or
 

1175
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,560
Sinclair something what a civics ID or
something I don't remember and he said

1176
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:27,570
something I don't remember and he said
 

1177
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,490
something I don't remember and he said
and he because he was explaining why he

1178
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:31,500
and he because he was explaining why he
 

1179
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,700
and he because he was explaining why he
started doing Linux and you know the

1180
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:34,710
started doing Linux and you know the
 

1181
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:42,280
started doing Linux and you know the
Quran because all the computers he had

1182
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,290

 

1183
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:47,630

in Finland he he for some reason elected

1184
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:47,640
in Finland he he for some reason elected
 

1185
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,040
in Finland he he for some reason elected
computer that was powerful but there was

1186
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,050
computer that was powerful but there was
 

1187
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:55,490
computer that was powerful but there was
the only way you can get software that

1188
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:55,500
the only way you can get software that
 

1189
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,410
the only way you can get software that
didn't come with a machine was to buy

1190
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:57,420
didn't come with a machine was to buy
 

1191
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,380
didn't come with a machine was to buy
software from the UK yeah back in 1980

1192
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:00,390
software from the UK yeah back in 1980
 

1193
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,020
software from the UK yeah back in 1980
and it has to be mailed by the post and

1194
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,030
and it has to be mailed by the post and
 

1195
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,660
and it has to be mailed by the post and
it could take a month to get that and it

1196
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:05,670
it could take a month to get that and it
 

1197
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:12,260
it could take a month to get that and it
was expensive and and so he started

1198
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,270
was expensive and and so he started
 

1199
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,810
was expensive and and so he started
doing his own thing and he learned how

1200
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:14,820
doing his own thing and he learned how
 

1201
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,280
doing his own thing and he learned how
to program and he said once that he was

1202
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,290
to program and he said once that he was
 

1203
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:24,830
to program and he said once that he was
doing what he thought was much he

1204
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:24,840
doing what he thought was much he
 

1205
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:32,420
doing what he thought was much he
programmed it in machine language what

1206
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:32,430
programmed it in machine language what
 

1207
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,910
programmed it in machine language what
he thought was assembler because he he

1208
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:34,920
he thought was assembler because he he
 

1209
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,380
he thought was assembler because he he
wrote the ones and zeros did that for

1210
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,390
wrote the ones and zeros did that for
 

1211
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,260
wrote the ones and zeros did that for
two years before so I explained to him

1212
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,270
two years before so I explained to him
 

1213
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:48,020
two years before so I explained to him
that he needed needed a compiler so a

1214
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,030
that he needed needed a compiler so a
 

1215
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,270
that he needed needed a compiler so a
friend of mine did the same thing on a

1216
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,280
friend of mine did the same thing on a
 

1217
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,600
friend of mine did the same thing on a
CPM machine he was writing literally the

1218
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:53,610
CPM machine he was writing literally the
 

1219
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,680
CPM machine he was writing literally the
machine code in hex and then he would he

1220
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:57,690
machine code in hex and then he would he
 

1221
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,370
machine code in hex and then he would he
wrote utilities in CPM that would then

1222
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:00,380
wrote utilities in CPM that would then
 

1223
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,290
wrote utilities in CPM that would then
assemble up all that or linked up all

1224
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:03,300
assemble up all that or linked up all
 

1225
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,050
assemble up all that or linked up all
that memory and bring it all up into

1226
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,060
that memory and bring it all up into
 

1227
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,640
that memory and bring it all up into
each of the individual pages that he

1228
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:07,650
each of the individual pages that he
 

1229
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,940
each of the individual pages that he
wrote codeine he would come he would

1230
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:09,950
wrote codeine he would come he would
 

1231
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,020
wrote codeine he would come he would
punch them all together

1232
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,030
punch them all together
 

1233
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,560
punch them all together
munch being a very technical word right

1234
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:14,570
munch being a very technical word right
 

1235
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,250
munch being a very technical word right
everything would bring them all together

1236
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,260
everything would bring them all together
 

1237
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,680
everything would bring them all together
and basically linked them up and I told

1238
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:18,690
and basically linked them up and I told
 

1239
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,790
and basically linked them up and I told
him at the time you know what you've

1240
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:19,800
