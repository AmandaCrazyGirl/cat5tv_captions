00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,080
because I have them so I got the
 

315
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,010
because I have them so I got the
Raspberry Pi set up I loaded up xfce for

316
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,020
Raspberry Pi set up I loaded up xfce for
 

317
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,660
Raspberry Pi set up I loaded up xfce for
because that's

318
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:54,670
because that's
 

319
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,660
because that's
the windows other window manager that I

320
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:57,670
the windows other window manager that I
 

321
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,920
the windows other window manager that I
prefer to use in Linux I don't like KDE

322
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:00,930
prefer to use in Linux I don't like KDE
 

323
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,290
prefer to use in Linux I don't like KDE
I'm sort of kinda like can known but

324
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:04,300
I'm sort of kinda like can known but
 

325
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,230
I'm sort of kinda like can known but
both of those like to like to have full

326
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,240
both of those like to like to have full
 

327
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,920
both of those like to like to have full
control over the background and I like

328
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:10,930
control over the background and I like
 

329
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,970
control over the background and I like
maintain myself which is like a gnome

330
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:13,980
maintain myself which is like a gnome
 

331
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,510
maintain myself which is like a gnome
2.5 right but the thing is again because

332
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:18,520
2.5 right but the thing is again because
 

333
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,790
2.5 right but the thing is again because
it's known it likes full control of the

334
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
it's known it likes full control of the
 

335
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,250
it's known it likes full control of the
background I likes to run X earth behind

336
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,260
background I likes to run X earth behind
 

337
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,610
background I likes to run X earth behind
in the background in the root window and

338
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:29,620
in the background in the root window and
 

339
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,340
in the background in the root window and
none of the KDE gnome or any of those

340
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,350
none of the KDE gnome or any of those
 

341
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,700
none of the KDE gnome or any of those
whatever version like for anything else

342
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:35,710
whatever version like for anything else
 

343
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,600
whatever version like for anything else
to draw on the root window and make it

344
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,610
to draw on the root window and make it
 

345
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,570
to draw on the root window and make it
visible but xfce does it has no problem

346
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:42,580
visible but xfce does it has no problem
 

347
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,780
visible but xfce does it has no problem
with that at all it's a lot simpler more

348
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:45,790
with that at all it's a lot simpler more
 

349
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,740
with that at all it's a lot simpler more
lightweight especially for the for the

350
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:48,750
lightweight especially for the for the
 

351
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,380
lightweight especially for the for the
laptops and such that perhaps are not as

352
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,390
laptops and such that perhaps are not as
 

353
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,240
laptops and such that perhaps are not as
powerful as that there's the desktop and

354
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,250
powerful as that there's the desktop and
 

355
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,700
powerful as that there's the desktop and
the graphics card is but for the

356
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:56,710
the graphics card is but for the
 

357
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,510
the graphics card is but for the
Raspberry Pi I had that all set up I

358
00:09:59,510 --> 00:09:59,520
Raspberry Pi I had that all set up I
 

359
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,510
Raspberry Pi I had that all set up I
don't don't judge me I use visual code I

360
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:03,520
don't don't judge me I use visual code I
 

361
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,130
don't don't judge me I use visual code I
use your studio did you know it's not

362
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:08,140
use your studio did you know it's not
 

363
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,500
use your studio did you know it's not
I think visual studio is specifically

364
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,510
I think visual studio is specifically
 

365
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,430
I think visual studio is specifically
yeah

366
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
yeah
 

367
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,400
yeah
visual studio specifically the Microsoft

368
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,410
visual studio specifically the Microsoft
 

369
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:21,060
visual studio specifically the Microsoft
product but it works but but code is

370
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,070
product but it works but but code is
 

371
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,730
product but it works but but code is
what I specifically use and I've just

372
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:23,740
what I specifically use and I've just
 

373
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,220
what I specifically use and I've just
found that to to be a nice environment

374
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,230
found that to to be a nice environment
 

375
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,560
found that to to be a nice environment
to run in build the thing with a make

376
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:28,570
to run in build the thing with a make
 

377
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,050
to run in build the thing with a make
file that were you know all the projects

378
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,060
file that were you know all the projects
 

379
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,260
file that were you know all the projects
I use all bill would make file and it

380
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,270
I use all bill would make file and it
 

381
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,680
I use all bill would make file and it
just things to work so I have I have

382
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:37,690
just things to work so I have I have
 

383
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,440
just things to work so I have I have
discovered I believe the Pantone is 240

384
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,450
discovered I believe the Pantone is 240
 

385
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,990
discovered I believe the Pantone is 240
by 240 not 320 by 320 which is I found

386
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,000
by 240 not 320 by 320 which is I found
 

387
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,470
by 240 not 320 by 320 which is I found
conflicting documentation but there's

388
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
conflicting documentation but there's
 

389
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,960
conflicting documentation but there's
more documentation that says it's 240 by

390
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:54,970
more documentation that says it's 240 by
 

391
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,650
more documentation that says it's 240 by
240 versus 320 by 320 so now I can't

392
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:58,660
240 versus 320 by 320 so now I can't
 

393
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,710
240 versus 320 by 320 so now I can't
even remember where is anyway whatever

394
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:01,720
even remember where is anyway whatever
 

395
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,780
even remember where is anyway whatever
thinking is I I'm gonna activate the

396
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:03,790
thinking is I I'm gonna activate the
 

397
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,600
thinking is I I'm gonna activate the
touch sensor and then I'm gonna log the

398
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:06,610
touch sensor and then I'm gonna log the
 

399
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,530
touch sensor and then I'm gonna log the
touch code

400
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:07,540
touch code
 

401
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,610
touch code
and I'm just gonna touch the

402
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:08,620
and I'm just gonna touch the
 

403
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,800
and I'm just gonna touch the
bottom-right corner to see what it tells

404
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:10,810
bottom-right corner to see what it tells
 

405
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,720
bottom-right corner to see what it tells
me that the Geo chords are that I

406
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:12,730
me that the Geo chords are that I
 

407
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,090
me that the Geo chords are that I
touched sure yeah which I figured I

408
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,100
touched sure yeah which I figured I
 

409
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,300
touched sure yeah which I figured I
could 240 by 240 or whatever it is yeah

410
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,310
could 240 by 240 or whatever it is yeah
 

411
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,389
could 240 by 240 or whatever it is yeah
or I could try drawing 320 by 320 on a

412
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:21,399
or I could try drawing 320 by 320 on a
 

413
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,699
or I could try drawing 320 by 320 on a
240 by 240 and only see the top

414
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:23,709
240 by 240 and only see the top
 

415
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,100
240 by 240 and only see the top
two-thirds and oh yes do you mean oh

416
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,110
two-thirds and oh yes do you mean oh
 

417
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,680
two-thirds and oh yes do you mean oh
yeah that would work as well right that

418
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:28,690
yeah that would work as well right that
 

419
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,300
yeah that would work as well right that
would make for sure that would guarantee

420
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,310
would make for sure that would guarantee
 

421
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,559
would make for sure that would guarantee
for sure that it's a 240 by 2 for down

422
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:34,569
for sure that it's a 240 by 2 for down
 

423
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,189
for sure that it's a 240 by 2 for down
to like an inch and a bit right so it's

424
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:38,199
to like an inch and a bit right so it's
 

425
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,410
to like an inch and a bit right so it's
still gonna be you know a pretty nice

426
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:40,420
still gonna be you know a pretty nice
 

427
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,990
still gonna be you know a pretty nice
resolution for that term for that sized

428
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,000
resolution for that term for that sized
 

429
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,650
resolution for that term for that sized
screen so that's I've also discovered

430
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:46,660
screen so that's I've also discovered
 

431
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,559
screen so that's I've also discovered
you know by researching the Adafruit

432
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:49,569
you know by researching the Adafruit
 

433
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:54,059
you know by researching the Adafruit
libraries the Adafruit library looks to

434
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:54,069
libraries the Adafruit library looks to
 

435
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:58,199
libraries the Adafruit library looks to
be a more generic library that tries to

436
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:58,209
be a more generic library that tries to
 

437
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,769
be a more generic library that tries to
drive all kinds of different all kinds

438
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:01,779
drive all kinds of different all kinds
 

439
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:08,790
drive all kinds of different all kinds
of different devices yeah and and bs t77

440
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
of different devices yeah and and bs t77
 

441
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,910
of different devices yeah and and bs t77
whatever the display is is only one of

442
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
whatever the display is is only one of
 

443
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,750
whatever the display is is only one of
those devices and because it's so

444
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
those devices and because it's so
 

445
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,389
those devices and because it's so
generic it makes it mmm

446
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
generic it makes it mmm
 

447
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,569
generic it makes it mmm
I would rather just focus on that advice

448
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:21,579
I would rather just focus on that advice
 

449
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,519
I would rather just focus on that advice
so what I did is I followed the logic

450
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:23,529
so what I did is I followed the logic
 

451
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:27,150
so what I did is I followed the logic
fruit or what it takes to draw a line on

452
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,160
fruit or what it takes to draw a line on
 

453
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,059
fruit or what it takes to draw a line on
the screen and I discovered there is no

454
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,069
the screen and I discovered there is no
 

455
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:33,480
the screen and I discovered there is no
primitive function and I couldn't find

456
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:33,490
primitive function and I couldn't find
 

457
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,860
primitive function and I couldn't find
one when I was looking at the low-level

458
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:34,870
one when I was looking at the low-level
 

459
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,319
one when I was looking at the low-level
documentation there's no primitive

460
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:37,329
documentation there's no primitive
 

461
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:38,759
documentation there's no primitive
function for actually drawing a line

462
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:38,769
function for actually drawing a line
 

463
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,009
function for actually drawing a line
from point A to point B you actually

464
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:41,019
from point A to point B you actually
 

465
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,110
from point A to point B you actually
have to figure out which pixels have to

466
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
have to figure out which pixels have to
 

467
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,930
have to figure out which pixels have to
be now you know between this point to

468
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:45,940
be now you know between this point to
 

469
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,329
be now you know between this point to
this point and enable that pixel yeah

470
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:48,339
this point and enable that pixel yeah
 

471
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,699
this point and enable that pixel yeah
I've done that before though so I've

472
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:50,709
I've done that before though so I've
 

473
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,710
I've done that before though so I've
done that before it really is not a

474
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
done that before it really is not a
 

475
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,069
done that before it really is not a
problem so I say again bresenhem's

476
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,079
problem so I say again bresenhem's
 

477
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:06,090
problem so I say again bresenhem's
algorithm for graphics yes finally math

478
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,100
algorithm for graphics yes finally math
 

479
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:13,350
algorithm for graphics yes finally math
comes in handy there's a little bit of

480
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
comes in handy there's a little bit of
 

481
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,410
comes in handy there's a little bit of
sarcasm they're both doing spines and

482
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:16,420
sarcasm they're both doing spines and
 

483
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,600
sarcasm they're both doing spines and
cosines to try and figure out where all

484
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:18,610
cosines to try and figure out where all
 

485
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,430
cosines to try and figure out where all
those positions should be in the

486
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:20,440
those positions should be in the
 

487
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,319
those positions should be in the
on the clock French so you know it's a

488
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:22,329
on the clock French so you know it's a
 

489
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:24,150
on the clock French so you know it's a
same thing but my point is though that

490
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
same thing but my point is though that
 

491
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,360
same thing but my point is though that
term and in fact whoever was a bow that

492
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,370
term and in fact whoever was a bow that
 

493
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,389
term and in fact whoever was a bow that
mentioned that term algorithm I think

494
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
mentioned that term algorithm I think
 

495
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,350
mentioned that term algorithm I think
that was mentioned in the Adafruit

496
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:34,360
that was mentioned in the Adafruit
 

497
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,389
that was mentioned in the Adafruit
Library I think it actually said thanks

498
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
Library I think it actually said thanks
 

499
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,179
Library I think it actually said thanks
thanks Google for pointing out that

500
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:39,189
thanks Google for pointing out that
 

501
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:43,400
thanks Google for pointing out that
algorithm so yeah oh good okay nice

502
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,410
algorithm so yeah oh good okay nice
 

503
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,629
algorithm so yeah oh good okay nice
computer science and university is such

that we had to write our own GPU drivers
 

509
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,509
that we had to write our own GPU drivers
are on GPU libraries I mean there was no

510
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
are on GPU libraries I mean there was no
 

511
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,860
are on GPU libraries I mean there was no
GPU yet so our own KF Raven I've written

that part of the data that's collected
 

527
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,129
that part of the data that's collected
in the census data is the lat/longs

528
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:26,139
in the census data is the lat/longs
 

529
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:31,350
in the census data is the lat/longs
of each segment of road in the entire

00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:38,709
road curbs or anything like that there's
 

535
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,889
road curbs or anything like that there's
all that long from here to here then let

all that long from here to here then let
 

537
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,379
all that long from here to here then let
go from here to here that's so sigmat of

00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:45,699
road are all the film is they have a
 

541
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:49,350
road are all the film is they have a
road in the country absolutely and each

542
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
road in the country absolutely and each
 

543
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,569
road in the country absolutely and each
of those segments are described in terms

00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:51,579
of those segments are described in terms
 

545
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,639
of those segments are described in terms
of what kind of road it is is it an

546
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:53,649
of what kind of road it is is it an
 

547
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,040
of what kind of road it is is it an
interstate is that a country road is

548
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,050
interstate is that a country road is
 

549
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,990
interstate is that a country road is
that a county road is it a state road

550
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
that a county road is it a state road
 

551
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,120
that a county road is it a state road
the name of it all of that information

552
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,130
the name of it all of that information
 

553
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,350
the name of it all of that information
is all recorded unfortunately what's not

554
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:04,360
is all recorded unfortunately what's not
 

555
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,210
is all recorded unfortunately what's not
recorded is whether it's a one-way road

556
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:06,220
recorded is whether it's a one-way road
 

557
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,639
recorded is whether it's a one-way road
or not but the important point of all

558
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:08,649
or not but the important point of all
 

559
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,220
or not but the important point of all
this is that I wrote a program that

560
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,230
this is that I wrote a program that
 

561
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,350
this is that I wrote a program that
takes that census data which are

562
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
takes that census data which are
 

563
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
takes that census data which are
downloaded and recorded onto like five

564
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,610
downloaded and recorded onto like five
 

565
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,199
downloaded and recorded onto like five
CDs they took all that census data

566
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:19,209
CDs they took all that census data
 

567
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,920
CDs they took all that census data
loaded up into a relational database and

568
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:21,930
loaded up into a relational database and
 

569
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,410
loaded up into a relational database and
then built a program that takes the XY

570
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,420
then built a program that takes the XY
 

571
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,449
then built a program that takes the XY
coordinates every every one of those

572
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:27,459
coordinates every every one of those
 

573
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,730
coordinates every every one of those
roads every one of those segments

574
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:29,740
roads every one of those segments
 

575
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,490
roads every one of those segments
converts those to XY coordinates and

576
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:32,500
converts those to XY coordinates and
 

577
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,900
converts those to XY coordinates and
then draws

578
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:33,910
then draws
 

579
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,720
then draws
so it draws a map from the census data

580
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:36,730
so it draws a map from the census data
 

581
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,450
so it draws a map from the census data
remarkably accurate surprisingly

582
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:39,460
remarkably accurate surprisingly
 

583
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,690
remarkably accurate surprisingly
accurate but there is so much data that

584
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:42,700
accurate but there is so much data that
 

585
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,900
accurate but there is so much data that
it takes ages to draw especially if you

586
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:45,910
it takes ages to draw especially if you
 

587
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,510
it takes ages to draw especially if you
zoom out to the entire country and have

588
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:48,520
zoom out to the entire country and have
 

589
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,540
zoom out to the entire country and have
to retrieve the entire data set and draw

590
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,550
to retrieve the entire data set and draw
 

591
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,970
to retrieve the entire data set and draw
them but if you're zoomed into a very

592
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:53,980
them but if you're zoomed into a very
 

593
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,330
them but if you're zoomed into a very
close you know a very small area then

594
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:57,340
close you know a very small area then
 

595
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,920
close you know a very small area then
there's very little data to retrieve

596
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:58,930
there's very little data to retrieve
 

597
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,960
there's very little data to retrieve
because you're only pulling the lat/long

598
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:00,970
because you're only pulling the lat/long
 

599
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,960
because you're only pulling the lat/long
from that top left to the top to the

600
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:03,970
from that top left to the top to the
 

601
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,150
from that top left to the top to the
bottom right and picking up all the

602
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
bottom right and picking up all the
 

603
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,020
bottom right and picking up all the
roads that are inside that boundary so

604
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,030
roads that are inside that boundary so
 

605
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,600
roads that are inside that boundary so
big fines reminding me there's a project

606
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:12,610
big fines reminding me there's a project
 

607
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,970
big fines reminding me there's a project
right now there's a project right now

608
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:14,980
right now there's a project right now
 

609
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,620
right now there's a project right now
that's that I'm really starting to see

610
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:16,630
that's that I'm really starting to see
 

611
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,510
that's that I'm really starting to see
take off that is really kind of

612
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:18,520
take off that is really kind of
 

613
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,870
take off that is really kind of
intriguing is that they have and I say

614
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:21,880
intriguing is that they have and I say
 

615
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,600
intriguing is that they have and I say
they I'm not sure who I'm sure a Google

616
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:24,610
they I'm not sure who I'm sure a Google
 

617
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,790
they I'm not sure who I'm sure a Google
search will reveal it to you but they've

618
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
search will reveal it to you but they've
 

619
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,700
search will reveal it to you but they've
recreated the entire earth like the

620
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:29,710
recreated the entire earth like the
 

621
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,430
recreated the entire earth like the
continents in Minecraft and so there's

622
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:32,440
continents in Minecraft and so there's
 

623
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,640
continents in Minecraft and so there's
this project where wow people are people

624
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:35,650
this project where wow people are people
 

625
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,680
this project where wow people are people
are claiming cities so like somebody has

626
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:37,690
are claiming cities so like somebody has
 

627
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,060
are claiming cities so like somebody has
claimed New York and somebody has

628
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,070
claimed New York and somebody has
 

629
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,130
claimed New York and somebody has
claimed Paris and and so they're

630
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,140
claimed Paris and and so they're
 

631
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,380
claimed Paris and and so they're
actually like master builders who are

632
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,390
actually like master builders who are
 

633
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,410
actually like master builders who are
building the actual structures that

634
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:46,420
building the actual structures that
 

635
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,320
building the actual structures that
exist on earth as they are right now so

636
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,330
exist on earth as they are right now so
 

637
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,770
exist on earth as they are right now so
the the goal with this whole project

638
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:51,780
the the goal with this whole project
 

639
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,150
the the goal with this whole project
thinking about the scale of your geo

640
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
thinking about the scale of your geo
 

641
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,770
thinking about the scale of your geo
coordinates and everything it's like so

642
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:55,780
coordinates and everything it's like so
 

643
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,450
coordinates and everything it's like so
they've recreated they've already

644
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:57,460
they've recreated they've already
 

645
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,970
they've recreated they've already
finished the landscape all of the

646
00:16:59,970 --> 00:16:59,980
finished the landscape all of the
 

647
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,220
finished the landscape all of the
continents the the topography of the

648
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,230
continents the the topography of the
 

649
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,380
continents the the topography of the
earth you can climb Mount Everest and

650
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,390
earth you can climb Mount Everest and
 

651
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,020
earth you can climb Mount Everest and
everything it has been done now they're

652
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,030
everything it has been done now they're
 

653
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,810
everything it has been done now they're
building the the actual structures like

654
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:09,820
building the the actual structures like
 

655
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,880
building the the actual structures like
the man-made so the natural stuff is

656
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:11,890
the man-made so the natural stuff is
 

657
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,980
the man-made so the natural stuff is
done the man-made stuff is being done

658
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:13,990
done the man-made stuff is being done
 

659
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,200
done the man-made stuff is being done
now which is just like there's some

660
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,210
now which is just like there's some
 

661
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,300
now which is just like there's some
videos on YouTube right now it's just

662
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,310
videos on YouTube right now it's just
 

663
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,390
videos on YouTube right now it's just
mind-bending what what they can do in a

664
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:21,400
mind-bending what what they can do in a
 

665
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,350
mind-bending what what they can do in a
video game like Minecraft what equity

666
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
video game like Minecraft what equity
 

667
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:34,320
video game like Minecraft what equity
that they that go to that about I don't

668
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,330
that they that go to that about I don't
 

669
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,480
that they that go to that about I don't
know the specific data Peter but I know

670
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,490
know the specific data Peter but I know
 

671
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,080
know the specific data Peter but I know
that they used actual map data in order

672
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,090
that they used actual map data in order
 

673
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,900
that they used actual map data in order
to generate the topography so it should

674
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:42,910
to generate the topography so it should
 

675
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,360
to generate the topography so it should
be pretty accurate as accurate as

676
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,370
be pretty accurate as accurate as
 

677
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,980
be pretty accurate as accurate as
something like Minecraft can be of

678
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,990
something like Minecraft can be of
 

679
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,760
something like Minecraft can be of
course it's made of

680
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:47,770
course it's made of
 

681
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,330
course it's made of
32 by 32 squares right yeah we're

682
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,340
32 by 32 squares right yeah we're
 

683
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,430
32 by 32 squares right yeah we're
talking about you know do we make you

684
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
talking about you know do we make you
 

685
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,220
talking about you know do we make you
that's one trick to the degree yeah it

686
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,230
that's one trick to the degree yeah it
 

687
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,500
that's one trick to the degree yeah it
wasn't good dignity great deed something

688
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:58,510
wasn't good dignity great deed something
 

689
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:06,480
wasn't good dignity great deed something
that 20 both yeah boy it is sorry I just

690
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,490
that 20 both yeah boy it is sorry I just
 

691
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,940
that 20 both yeah boy it is sorry I just
wanted to say that it is scale its to

692
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:08,950
wanted to say that it is scale its to
 

693
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,660
wanted to say that it is scale its to
scale so if you were to walk in the game

694
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:12,670
scale so if you were to walk in the game
 

695
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,270
scale so if you were to walk in the game
its KITT its to scale like it would blow

696
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
its KITT its to scale like it would blow
 

697
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,140
its KITT its to scale like it would blow
presumably take you just 1 meter right

698
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,150
presumably take you just 1 meter right
 

699
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,630
presumably take you just 1 meter right
the game I'm not sure is that right

700
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:21,640
the game I'm not sure is that right
 

701
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,360
the game I'm not sure is that right
that's I think that's that's for you yes

702
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,370
that's I think that's that's for you yes
 

703
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,540
that's I think that's that's for you yes
that makes that one up late that's true

704
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:27,550
that makes that one up late that's true
 

705
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,660
that makes that one up late that's true
minecraft that's well now here's the

706
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:30,670
minecraft that's well now here's the
 

707
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,990
minecraft that's well now here's the
thing that Robbie in mind in my test and

708
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
thing that Robbie in mind in my test and
 

709
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,180
thing that Robbie in mind in my test and
I'm sure I think it might be true in

710
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,190
I'm sure I think it might be true in
 

711
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,450
I'm sure I think it might be true in
Minecraft as well the the world is

712
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:42,460
Minecraft as well the the world is
 

713
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,850
Minecraft as well the the world is
generated procedurally from a seed that

714
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:44,860
generated procedurally from a seed that
 

715
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,310
generated procedurally from a seed that
is like a number that is like I don't

716
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,320
is like a number that is like I don't
 

717
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,380
is like a number that is like I don't
know 32 hitch bytes long or something

718
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:49,390
know 32 hitch bytes long or something
 

719
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,960
know 32 hitch bytes long or something
like that is that also true of Minecraft

720
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:51,970
like that is that also true of Minecraft
 

721
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,049
like that is that also true of Minecraft
and if that is true and did they come up

722
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:55,059
and if that is true and did they come up
 

723
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,160
and if that is true and did they come up
with a did they come up with a seed that

724
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,170
with a did they come up with a seed that
 

725
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,260
with a did they come up with a seed that
was as close as possible so they

726
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,270
was as close as possible so they
 

727
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,850
was as close as possible so they
wouldn't have to modify it or did they

728
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:02,860
wouldn't have to modify it or did they
 

729
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,770
wouldn't have to modify it or did they
just start with literally one block and

730
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:04,780
just start with literally one block and
 

731
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,080
just start with literally one block and
there wouldn't from there I think it's

732
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,090
there wouldn't from there I think it's
 

733
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,299
there wouldn't from there I think it's
more like what the seed does is it it

734
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:09,309
more like what the seed does is it it
 

735
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,880
more like what the seed does is it it
Auto generates as you enter regions of

736
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:11,890
Auto generates as you enter regions of
 

737
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,580
Auto generates as you enter regions of
the map because minecraft mind tests are

738
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:14,590
the map because minecraft mind tests are
 

739
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,860
the map because minecraft mind tests are
designed to be basically infinite worlds

740
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:16,870
designed to be basically infinite worlds
 

741
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,710
designed to be basically infinite worlds
so if you travel beyond the previously

742
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:19,720
so if you travel beyond the previously
 

743
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,440
so if you travel beyond the previously
generated area it will just use the seed

744
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,450
generated area it will just use the seed
 

745
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,660
generated area it will just use the seed
to generate a new area but it's pretty

746
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:24,670
to generate a new area but it's pretty
 

747
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,820
to generate a new area but it's pretty
much random right based on algorithms

748
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:26,830
much random right based on algorithms
 

749
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,250
much random right based on algorithms
and the seed but in this case I think

750
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,260
and the seed but in this case I think
 

751
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,240
and the seed but in this case I think
what they've done is they've taken

752
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,250
what they've done is they've taken
 

753
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,500
what they've done is they've taken
actual map data and converted it into a

754
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:34,510
actual map data and converted it into a
 

755
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,740
actual map data and converted it into a
pre generated Minecraft world so there

756
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:37,750
pre generated Minecraft world so there
 

757
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,210
pre generated Minecraft world so there
will be no seed generation on that map

758
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,220
will be no seed generation on that map
 

759
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,590
will be no seed generation on that map
because it's specifically generated by

760
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:46,600
because it's specifically generated by
 

761
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,640
because it's specifically generated by
the by the whoever designed the program

762
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:50,650
the by the whoever designed the program
 

763
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,490
the by the whoever designed the program
to convert an actual clothe the other

764
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:53,500
to convert an actual clothe the other
 

765
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,980
to convert an actual clothe the other
the other question that's my next

766
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:55,990
the other question that's my next
 

767
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,230
the other question that's my next
question if you keep walking in one

768
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
question if you keep walking in one
 

769
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,610
question if you keep walking in one
direction like yeah yeah

770
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:00,620
direction like yeah yeah
 

771
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,460
direction like yeah yeah
you got it is flatter right minecraft

772
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:04,470
you got it is flatter right minecraft
 

773
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:13,340
you got it is flatter right minecraft
minecraft' is flattering so we're

774
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,350
minecraft' is flattering so we're
 

775
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,870
minecraft' is flattering so we're
probably gonna see that where you know

776
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
probably gonna see that where you know
 

777
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,690
probably gonna see that where you know
yeah if you if you go beyond the the

778
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:17,700
yeah if you if you go beyond the the
 

779
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,030
yeah if you if you go beyond the the
edge of the map then yeah you'd probably

780
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,040
edge of the map then yeah you'd probably
 

781
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,890
edge of the map then yeah you'd probably
just either fall off or it would just

782
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:21,900
just either fall off or it would just
 

783
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,920
just either fall off or it would just
keep going into nothingness I would

784
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:24,930
keep going into nothingness I would
 

785
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,390
keep going into nothingness I would
expect because it is not going to be

786
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
expect because it is not going to be
 

787
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,090
expect because it is not going to be
globular it's not going to be a sphere

788
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,100
globular it's not going to be a sphere
 

789
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,210
globular it's not going to be a sphere
it would be it would be a flat surface

790
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,220
it would be it would be a flat surface
 

791
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,080
it would be it would be a flat surface
well the zero Meridian is is England

792
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,090
well the zero Meridian is is England
 

793
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,690
well the zero Meridian is is England
that's that's the Prime Meridian

794
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:40,700
that's that's the Prime Meridian
 

795
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,030
that's that's the Prime Meridian
Greenwich I believe so they're not going

796
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,040
Greenwich I believe so they're not going
 

797
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,380
Greenwich I believe so they're not going
to split that in half what they'll

798
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,390
to split that in half what they'll
 

799
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,040
to split that in half what they'll
probably do is split the most of what's

800
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,050
probably do is split the most of what's
 

801
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,470
probably do is split the most of what's
a thousand eighty degrees mostly ocean

802
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:51,480
a thousand eighty degrees mostly ocean
 

803
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,610
a thousand eighty degrees mostly ocean
or sea so they'll probably worst case

804
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:55,620
or sea so they'll probably worst case
 

805
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,500
or sea so they'll probably worst case
scenario split some islands or something

806
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:57,510
scenario split some islands or something
 

807
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,980
scenario split some islands or something
in half like this yeah but you know as

808
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:00,990
in half like this yeah but you know as
 

809
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,480
in half like this yeah but you know as
you draw it because if you don't go

810
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,490
you draw it because if you don't go
 

811
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,270
you draw it because if you don't go
round and you don't end up you know

812
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
round and you don't end up you know
 

813
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,690
round and you don't end up you know
falling off one and coming on the other

814
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:07,700
falling off one and coming on the other
 

815
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,430
falling off one and coming on the other
if that's hundred eighty degree Meridian

816
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,440
if that's hundred eighty degree Meridian
 

817
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,710
if that's hundred eighty degree Meridian
happens to pull in an island you're

818
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
happens to pull in an island you're
 

819
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,990
happens to pull in an island you're
gonna split that island you turn out it

820
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,000
gonna split that island you turn out it
 

821
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,020
gonna split that island you turn out it
will not be does it they go round it on

822
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,030
will not be does it they go round it on
 

823
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,240
will not be does it they go round it on
the real map down a degree boy they go

824
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,250
the real map down a degree boy they go
 

825
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,020
the real map down a degree boy they go
round the island one is one beaded on

826
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,030
round the island one is one beaded on
 

827
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,400
round the island one is one beaded on
one web to time yeah I guess it doesn't

828
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,410
one web to time yeah I guess it doesn't
 

829
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,360
one web to time yeah I guess it doesn't
matter whether they whether they stop at

830
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,370
matter whether they whether they stop at
 

831
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,270
matter whether they whether they stop at
180 degrees they could keep going to 190

832
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,280
180 degrees they could keep going to 190
 

833
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,690
180 degrees they could keep going to 190
degrees if they had to be perfectly that

834
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:41,700
degrees if they had to be perfectly that
 

835
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,060
degrees if they had to be perfectly that
what to do that just to compete and I'm

836
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,070
what to do that just to compete and I'm
 

837
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,040
what to do that just to compete and I'm
going on the assumption that it would be

838
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,050
going on the assumption that it would be
 

839
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,630
going on the assumption that it would be
flat but there's always the possibility

840
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:47,640
flat but there's always the possibility
 

841
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,060
flat but there's always the possibility
they could write mods for example that

842
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,070
they could write mods for example that
 

843
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,510
they could write mods for example that
would automatically create a an

844
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
would automatically create a an
 

845
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,860
would automatically create a an
appearance of continuation by the other

846
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:56,870
appearance of continuation by the other
 

847
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,340
appearance of continuation by the other
teleporting basically what about VD yeah

848
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,350
teleporting basically what about VD yeah
 

849
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,380
teleporting basically what about VD yeah
what about the northernmost and

850
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,390
what about the northernmost and
 

851
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,600
what about the northernmost and
southernmost latitudes because as you go

852
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:05,610
southernmost latitudes because as you go
 

853
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,030
southernmost latitudes because as you go
further north or further south those

854
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,040
further north or further south those
 

855
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,710
further north or further south those
east-west points are closer and closer

856
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:09,720
east-west points are closer and closer
 

857
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,840
east-west points are closer and closer
together that's the function that that's

858
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:11,850
together that's the function that that's
 

859
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,390
together that's the function that that's
what a glass how do you handle

860
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
what a glass how do you handle
 

861
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,190
what a glass how do you handle
is it going to be yeah is it going to be

862
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,200
is it going to be yeah is it going to be
 

863
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,520
is it going to be yeah is it going to be
equirectangular or is it going to be

864
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:18,530
equirectangular or is it going to be
 

865
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,880
equirectangular or is it going to be
yeah

866
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:19,890
yeah
 

867
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,830
yeah
now that's definitely true it'll be

868
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:21,840
now that's definitely true it'll be
 

869
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,600
now that's definitely true it'll be
interesting you have that problem with

870
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:23,610
interesting you have that problem with
 

871
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,000
interesting you have that problem with
aeronautical maps I mean the problem

872
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,010
aeronautical maps I mean the problem
 

873
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,380
aeronautical maps I mean the problem
that we have we had what we call

874
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,390
that we have we had what we call
 

875
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,720
that we have we had what we call
sectionals right and the problem is the

876
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:29,730
sectionals right and the problem is the
 

877
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,300
sectionals right and the problem is the
further north you go the the area

878
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,310
further north you go the the area
 

879
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,830
further north you go the the area
covered by the sectional at the

880
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
covered by the sectional at the
 

881
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,500
covered by the sectional at the
northernmost piece it's much less than

882
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:36,510
northernmost piece it's much less than
 

883
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,200
northernmost piece it's much less than
the area covered by the southern most

884
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,210
the area covered by the southern most
 

885
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,110
the area covered by the southern most
piece about Matt so it's actually I

886
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,120
piece about Matt so it's actually I
 

887
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,630
piece about Matt so it's actually I
think it's actually drawn you know

888
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640

 

889
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,220

angular I think this is the ages of per

890
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,230
angular I think this is the ages of per
 

891
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,100
angular I think this is the ages of per
than able to account for that yeah to

892
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,110
than able to account for that yeah to
 

893
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,490
than able to account for that yeah to
try to keep the spacing somewhat the

894
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:55,500
try to keep the spacing somewhat the
 

895
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:02,120
try to keep the spacing somewhat the
same between the between the landmarks

896
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,130
same between the between the landmarks
 

897
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,660
same between the between the landmarks
yeah I'm having trouble forming words

898
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:05,670
yeah I'm having trouble forming words
 

899
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,220
yeah I'm having trouble forming words
today I don't know what the problem is

900
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,230
today I don't know what the problem is
 

901
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,430
today I don't know what the problem is
you know I know because you've got a

902
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,440
you know I know because you've got a
 

903
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,080
you know I know because you've got a
sphere and you're trying to put it onto

904
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,090
sphere and you're trying to put it onto
 

905
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,700
sphere and you're trying to put it onto
a flat plane so yeah early early map

906
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:15,710
a flat plane so yeah early early map
 

907
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,850
a flat plane so yeah early early map
drawers had to figure that out and now

908
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:19,860
drawers had to figure that out and now
 

909
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,810
drawers had to figure that out and now
it's gonna be the same thing for

910
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:20,820
it's gonna be the same thing for
 

911
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,210
it's gonna be the same thing for
Minecraft but mine a month they can

912
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:23,220
Minecraft but mine a month they can
 

913
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,300
Minecraft but mine a month they can
rescue yeah but they can't go

914
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,310
rescue yeah but they can't go
 

915
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,430
rescue yeah but they can't go
equirectangular because then if you were

916
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:28,440
equirectangular because then if you were
 

917
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,620
equirectangular because then if you were
at that northernmost spot what is

918
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:30,630
at that northernmost spot what is
 

919
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,620
at that northernmost spot what is
everything squished and in like so it's

920
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:33,630
everything squished and in like so it's
 

921
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,840
everything squished and in like so it's
right they have to figure out the math

922
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:35,850
right they have to figure out the math
 

923
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:42,800
right they have to figure out the math
behind luckily this math to do that

924
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:42,810
behind luckily this math to do that
 

925
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,770
behind luckily this math to do that
so yes spiracle formulas that lets you

926
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:45,780
so yes spiracle formulas that lets you
 

927
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,930
so yes spiracle formulas that lets you
get you a Great Circle distance and all

928
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:47,940
get you a Great Circle distance and all
 

929
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,420
get you a Great Circle distance and all
that good fun stuff which can yield some

930
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:50,430
that good fun stuff which can yield some
 

931
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,460
that good fun stuff which can yield some
surprising results because you expect to

932
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:52,470
surprising results because you expect to
 

933
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,890
surprising results because you expect to
go from like Canada to England then you

934
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:54,900
go from like Canada to England then you
 

935
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,540
go from like Canada to England then you
