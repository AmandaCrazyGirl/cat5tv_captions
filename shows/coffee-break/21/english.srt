to say we challenged me to come up with
 

47
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,920
to say we challenged me to come up with
a solution before you could come up with

48
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:09,930
a solution before you could come up with
 

49
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,770
a solution before you could come up with
a PHP solution well I already did it

50
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:12,780
a PHP solution well I already did it
 

51
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,170
a PHP solution well I already did it
I already found a PHP solution online so

52
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:20,180

 

53
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,700

that was the script I found this was a

54
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:22,710
that was the script I found this was a
 

55
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,090
that was the script I found this was a
this was a conversion script that would

56
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,100
this was a conversion script that would
 

57
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,969
this was a conversion script that would
take a a avatar and convert it to a JSON

58
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:31,979
take a a avatar and convert it to a JSON
 

59
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,380
take a a avatar and convert it to a JSON
format and it's part of their Sabre

60
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:35,390
format and it's part of their Sabre
 

61
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,319
format and it's part of their Sabre
suite of tools and it turns out you just

62
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:39,329
suite of tools and it turns out you just
 

63
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,010
suite of tools and it turns out you just
have to get that that program from the

64
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,020
have to get that that program from the
 

65
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,950
have to get that that program from the
repository and it'll just do the

66
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
repository and it'll just do the
 

67
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,899
repository and it'll just do the
conversion problem is it's written in

68
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:47,909
conversion problem is it's written in
 

69
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,960
conversion problem is it's written in
PHP and it's supposed to run on the

70
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:50,970
PHP and it's supposed to run on the
 

71
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,219
PHP and it's supposed to run on the
command line it's going to make it a

72
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,229
command line it's going to make it a
 

73
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,560
command line it's going to make it a
little difficult I mean I can use the

74
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:54,570
little difficult I mean I can use the
 

75
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,359
little difficult I mean I can use the
system command in in C to run a command

76
00:01:59,359 --> 00:01:59,369
system command in in C to run a command
 

77
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,490
system command in in C to run a command
line arguments not very secure to do it

78
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:01,500
line arguments not very secure to do it
 

79
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,240
line arguments not very secure to do it
that way so I'm still thinking about how

80
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,250
that way so I'm still thinking about how
 

81
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,679
that way so I'm still thinking about how

115
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,280
it is a PHP script but it's running in
bash so it's using the environment

116
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,290
bash so it's using the environment
 

117
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,750
bash so it's using the environment
variable to to like I'm using slash user

118
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:50,760
variable to to like I'm using slash user
 

119
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,100

00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,110
slash bin slash env PHP as the
 

121
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,540
slash bin slash env PHP as the
environment so I have a comma separated

129
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,760
this email blast to and that was from an
Excel spreadsheet that I opened up in

130
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:07,770
Excel spreadsheet that I opened up in
 

131
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,910
Excel spreadsheet that I opened up in
LibreOffice and saved it as a CSV file

132
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:10,920
LibreOffice and saved it as a CSV file
 

133
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,910
LibreOffice and saved it as a CSV file
and then my program goes through

134
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
and then my program goes through
 

135
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
and then my program goes through
converts that into a PHP array of name

136
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,410
converts that into a PHP array of name
 

137
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,530
converts that into a PHP array of name
and email address and then cycles

138
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:18,540
and email address and then cycles
 

139
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,420
and email address and then cycles
through that generates fresh HTML email

00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:11,099
thing would have to run as a service
 

315
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,649
thing would have to run as a service
because it's got to be always available

316
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:13,659
because it's got to be always available
 

317
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,510
because it's got to be always available
just like iPhone Oh would have to do

318
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
just like iPhone Oh would have to do
 

319
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,589
just like iPhone Oh would have to do
right make sense

320
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
right make sense
 

321
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,499
right make sense
so the the thing is it's not going to be

322
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:22,509
so the the thing is it's not going to be
 

323
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,939
so the the thing is it's not going to be
something you would run at the command

324
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:23,949
something you would run at the command
 

325
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,890
something you would run at the command
line and pipe input you know pipe the

326
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:25,900
line and pipe input you know pipe the
 

327
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,990
line and pipe input you know pipe the
output to something else this would be

328
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
output to something else this would be
 

329
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,959
output to something else this would be
something that you would have this would

330
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:33,969
something that you would have this would
 

331
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,420
something that you would have this would
be I'm hearing Peter Peter

332
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,430
be I'm hearing Peter Peter
 

333
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:45,180
be I'm hearing Peter Peter
Oh Peter I just I just let him play okay

334
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,190

okay it's okay for me to keep talking
man yeah you go ahead I'm gonna mute

338
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:49,720
man yeah you go ahead I'm gonna mute
 

339
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,940
man yeah you go ahead I'm gonna mute
Peters mic because it doesn't seem

340
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:50,950
Peters mic because it doesn't seem
 

341
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,560
Peters mic because it doesn't seem
be paying attention to us all right it's

342
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,570
be paying attention to us all right it's
 

343
00:08:52,570 --> 00:09:00,120
be paying attention to us all right it's
done okay thank you I had to do that so

344
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,130
done okay thank you I had to do that so
 

345
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,020
done okay thank you I had to do that so
this thing would be a service and what

346
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,030
this thing would be a service and what
 

347
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,270
this thing would be a service and what
I'm thinking is it will just keep keep a

348
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm thinking is it will just keep keep a
 

349
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,920
I'm thinking is it will just keep keep a
local database because you don't know

350
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:07,930
local database because you don't know
 

351
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,170
local database because you don't know
what the connectivity would be to the

352
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,180
what the connectivity would be to the
 

353
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,720
what the connectivity would be to the
backing store yes and the terrible or

354
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:15,730
backing store yes and the terrible or
 

355
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,030
backing store yes and the terrible or
caldo backing store so it would keep a

356
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
caldo backing store so it would keep a
 

357
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,880
caldo backing store so it would keep a
local copy of all the data in its own

358
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:23,890
local copy of all the data in its own
 

359
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,690
local copy of all the data in its own
database and it's just been a question

360
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:27,700
database and it's just been a question
 

361
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,120
database and it's just been a question
of it's been just a question of keeping

362
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,130
of it's been just a question of keeping
 

363
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,580
of it's been just a question of keeping
them in sync

364
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:31,590
them in sync
 

365
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,100
them in sync
the idea is that any application not

366
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,110
the idea is that any application not
 

367
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,800
the idea is that any application not
just iPhone open any other application

368
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:37,810
just iPhone open any other application
 

369
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,550
just iPhone open any other application
that needs this data 10 can call this

370
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:41,560
that needs this data 10 can call this
 

371
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,670
that needs this data 10 can call this
service and get what it needs what I'm

372
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:44,680
service and get what it needs what I'm
 

373
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,940
service and get what it needs what I'm
thinking of is just returning JSON back

374
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:46,950
thinking of is just returning JSON back
 

375
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,090
thinking of is just returning JSON back
instead of the actual vCard because why

376
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,100
instead of the actual vCard because why
 

377
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,090
instead of the actual vCard because why
I mean otherwise it would be just a

378
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,100
I mean otherwise it would be just a
 

379
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,420
I mean otherwise it would be just a
straight through you know mediation

380
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,430
straight through you know mediation
 

381
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,890
straight through you know mediation
service right you just be getting the

382
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:58,900
service right you just be getting the
 

383
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,260
service right you just be getting the
data directly out of the Cal they're

384
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,270
data directly out of the Cal they're
 

385
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,860
data directly out of the Cal they're
back in and returning it I think it

386
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:04,870
back in and returning it I think it
 

387
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,090
back in and returning it I think it
would make more sense to return

388
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,100
would make more sense to return
 

389
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,590
would make more sense to return
something that's a little better

390
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
something that's a little better
 

391
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,350
something that's a little better
structured that can be used in C or in

392
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,360
structured that can be used in C or in
 

393
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,830
structured that can be used in C or in
Joe or whatever right so no reason I see

394
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:13,840
Joe or whatever right so no reason I see
 

395
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,020
Joe or whatever right so no reason I see
I like that idea too because then when

396
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,030
I like that idea too because then when
 

397
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,240
I like that idea too because then when
you're offline you've got access to your

398
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,250
you're offline you've got access to your
 

399
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,250
you're offline you've got access to your
pal data right right right

400
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,260
pal data right right right
 

401
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,410
pal data right right right
and I'm I'm a pay-as-you-go subscriber

402
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,420
and I'm I'm a pay-as-you-go subscriber
 

403
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,250
and I'm I'm a pay-as-you-go subscriber
so basically my smartphone I use it for

404
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,260
so basically my smartphone I use it for
 

405
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,080
so basically my smartphone I use it for
like if the alarm goes off at the studio

406
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,090
like if the alarm goes off at the studio
 

407
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,030
like if the alarm goes off at the studio
the alarm go has to be able to get a

408
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,040
the alarm go has to be able to get a
 

409
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,570
the alarm go has to be able to get a
hold of me otherwise it's Wi-Fi only so

410
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:33,580
hold of me otherwise it's Wi-Fi only so
 

411
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,670
hold of me otherwise it's Wi-Fi only so
yeah I don't have a data plan or

412
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
yeah I don't have a data plan or
 

413
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,160
yeah I don't have a data plan or
anything like that so and just like that

414
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,170
anything like that so and just like that
 

415
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,680
anything like that so and just like that
perfect for that because we really know

416
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:40,690
perfect for that because we really know
 

417
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,370
perfect for that because we really know
yeah it would be we just periodically

418
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:43,380
yeah it would be we just periodically
 

419
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,470
yeah it would be we just periodically
seek to the Cal that side that server or

420
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
seek to the Cal that side that server or
 

421
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,570
seek to the Cal that side that server or
it would do it on demand if you make a

422
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:48,580
it would do it on demand if you make a
 

423
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,840
it would do it on demand if you make a
change locally from the phone right and

424
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:51,850
change locally from the phone right and
 

425
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,490
change locally from the phone right and
make a call that would change some data

426
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:53,500
make a call that would change some data
 

427
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,790
make a call that would change some data
it would then attempt to propagate that

428
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
it would then attempt to propagate that
 

429
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,640
it would then attempt to propagate that
change back to them so they make a card

430
00:10:59,640 --> 00:10:59,650
change back to them so they make a card
 

431
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,070
change back to them so they make a card
app server and if it can't do it then it

432
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,080
app server and if it can't do it then it
 

433
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,440
app server and if it can't do it then it
says okay I'm going to wait until can be

434
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,450
says okay I'm going to wait until can be
 

435
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,750
says okay I'm going to wait until can be
- right the Wi-Fi comes up and I can

436
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:06,760
- right the Wi-Fi comes up and I can
 

437
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,600
- right the Wi-Fi comes up and I can
contact the server and away not perfect

438
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,610
contact the server and away not perfect
 

439
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,780
contact the server and away not perfect
I like that's the best plane we'll see

440
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:12,790
I like that's the best plane we'll see
 

441
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,940
I like that's the best plane we'll see
what happens now go build that in PHP

442
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:14,950
what happens now go build that in PHP
 

443
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,829
what happens now go build that in PHP
Robbie and it has to be a service now my

I've been able to do is quite literally

448
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:30,339
I've been able to do is quite literally
 

449
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,300
I've been able to do is quite literally
just work stuff because it's like I sit

450
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,310
just work stuff because it's like I sit

heard of like a new board what's that
 

463

that for the first Monday of next month
 

481
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:06,329
that for the first Monday of next month
is to use a PHP a date strings - - and

482
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:06,339
is to use a PHP a date strings - - and
 

483
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:10,650
is to use a PHP a date strings - - and
manipulate those so yeah cuz they're

484
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:10,660
manipulate those so yeah cuz they're
 

485
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,300
manipulate those so yeah cuz they're
closest

486
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,310
closest
 

487
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:16,400
closest
as I kept a PHP encoding I use it for

488
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,410
as I kept a PHP encoding I use it for
 

489
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,960
as I kept a PHP encoding I use it for
virtually everything you guys see this

490
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:20,970
virtually everything you guys see this
 

491
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,600

thing here this is kind of neat can you
 

493
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,880
thing here this is kind of neat can you
see that looks like a string that's only

494
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:25,890
see that looks like a string that's only
 

495
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,620
see that looks like a string that's only
yes so this is a cake ASB thirteen point

can you still see yeah yeah yeah so it's

504
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
can you still see yeah yeah yeah so it's
 

505
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,540
can you still see yeah yeah yeah so it's
got the PI on the back and then it's got

506
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,550
got the PI on the back and then it's got
 

507
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,820
got the PI on the back and then it's got
HDMI output to go into the touchscreen

508
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:49,830
HDMI output to go into the touchscreen
 

509
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,600
HDMI output to go into the touchscreen
and everything else and I've got it

510
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,610
and everything else and I've got it
 

511
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,860
and everything else and I've got it
connected to my Wi-Fi and I've got it

connected to my Wi-Fi and I've got it
 

513
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,010
connected to my Wi-Fi and I've got it
using a Bluetooth keyboard so that I can

514
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,020
using a Bluetooth keyboard so that I can
 

515
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,880
using a Bluetooth keyboard so that I can
do that so I've got this four mouse

do that so I've got this four mouse
right can you guys see the screen yeah

518
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:08,580
right can you guys see the screen yeah
 

519
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,250
right can you guys see the screen yeah
yeah that's that's a terminal window

520
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,260
yeah that's that's a terminal window
 

521
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,840
yeah that's that's a terminal window
that I'm moving around there and then

522
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:11,850
that I'm moving around there and then
 

523
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,210
that I'm moving around there and then
I've got this four keyboard and then

524
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,220
I've got this four keyboard and then
 

525
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,579
I've got this four keyboard and then
what I'm doing so I've got the tascam DP

526
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:16,589
what I'm doing so I've got the tascam DP
 

527
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:21,640
what I'm doing so I've got the tascam DP
24 SD this mixer it has USB connectivity

528
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:21,650
24 SD this mixer it has USB connectivity
 

529
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,250
24 SD this mixer it has USB connectivity
but I can't get a cable all the way to

530
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:25,260
but I can't get a cable all the way to
 

531
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,210
but I can't get a cable all the way to
the broadcast server to connect it so

532
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,220
the broadcast server to connect it so
 

533
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,160
the broadcast server to connect it so
and the USB connectivity isn't for audio

534
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,170
and the USB connectivity isn't for audio
 

535
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,050
and the USB connectivity isn't for audio
it's for files so it stores everything

536
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,060
it's for files so it stores everything
 

537
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,970
it's for files so it stores everything
there's an SD card in the back of it

538
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:37,980
there's an SD card in the back of it
 

539
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,020
there's an SD card in the back of it
nice so but every time I'm finished the

540
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,030
nice so but every time I'm finished the
 

541
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,420
nice so but every time I'm finished the
show I have to take out the SD card plug

542
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,430
show I have to take out the SD card plug
 

543
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,070
show I have to take out the SD card plug
it into the server and then copy the wav

544
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,080
it into the server and then copy the wav
 

545
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,920
it into the server and then copy the wav
files off of the board in order to work

546
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:48,930
files off of the board in order to work
 

547
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,440
files off of the board in order to work
on the video so instead what I'm going

548
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,450
on the video so instead what I'm going
 

549
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,100
on the video so instead what I'm going
to do is it has USB connectivity for the

550
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,110
to do is it has USB connectivity for the
 

551
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,570
to do is it has USB connectivity for the
filesystem so it'll show up as an

552
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:56,580
filesystem so it'll show up as an
 

553
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,970
filesystem so it'll show up as an
external hard drive so I'm going to

554
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:58,980
external hard drive so I'm going to
 

555
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,699
external hard drive so I'm going to
connect that to the Raspberry Pi on the

556
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:01,709
connect that to the Raspberry Pi on the
 

557
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,520
connect that to the Raspberry Pi on the
kick ASB screen with a USB cable and

558
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,530
kick ASB screen with a USB cable and
 

559
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,010
kick ASB screen with a USB cable and
then use the Wi-Fi to connect it over

560
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,020
then use the Wi-Fi to connect it over
 

561
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,430
then use the Wi-Fi to connect it over
samba the two of the broadcast ray you

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,200
use it's a Windows machine machine is
 

567
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,220
use it's a Windows machine machine is
your problem right

568
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,230
your problem right
 

569
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,600
your problem right
I got I got a I'm not gonna use NFS on

570
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:28,610
I got I got a I'm not gonna use NFS on
 

571
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,620
I got I got a I'm not gonna use NFS on
Windows I got to use CIFS or Samba so

572
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:31,630
Windows I got to use CIFS or Samba so
 

573
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,300
Windows I got to use CIFS or Samba so
but that will give me direct access to

574
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,310
but that will give me direct access to
 

575
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,270
but that will give me direct access to
the built-in storage on the tascam so

576
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,280
the built-in storage on the tascam so
 

577
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,130
the built-in storage on the tascam so
when we record a show I can just

578
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,140
when we record a show I can just
 

579
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,990
when we record a show I can just
immediately start editing through the

long as the mixer is on it'll have

586
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,280
long as the mixer is on it'll have
 

587
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,200
long as the mixer is on it'll have
access through this computer but I use a

588
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,210
access through this computer but I use a
 

589
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,890
access through this computer but I use a
samba for sharing files it's one thing

590
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:56,900
samba for sharing files it's one thing
 

591
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,910
samba for sharing files it's one thing
it's easier to control

592
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:00,920
it's easier to control
 

593
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,120
it's easier to control
in my opinion and the other thing is

594
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,130
in my opinion and the other thing is
 

595
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,760
in my opinion and the other thing is
that if the NFS server noise and inertia

596
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:09,770
that if the NFS server noise and inertia
 

597
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,600
that if the NFS server noise and inertia
is mounted then the system it tries to

598
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:13,610
is mounted then the system it tries to
 

599
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,540
is mounted then the system it tries to
use the shared drive the system is in

600
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,550
use the shared drive the system is in
 

601
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,540
use the shared drive the system is in
danger of locking up until there until

602
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:22,550
danger of locking up until there until
 

603
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:34,480
danger of locking up until there until
the server is back up so yeah and that

604
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,490
the server is back up so yeah and that
 

605
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,640
the server is back up so yeah and that
can happen for sure in this case I don't

606
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,650
can happen for sure in this case I don't
 

607
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,900
can happen for sure in this case I don't
think it'll happen cuz I'll just mount

608
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:37,910
think it'll happen cuz I'll just mount
 

609
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,910
think it'll happen cuz I'll just mount
it an ell map it as a network drive so

610
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
it an ell map it as a network drive so
 

611
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,770
it an ell map it as a network drive so
it'll just say can't connect if it's not

612
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:41,780
it'll just say can't connect if it's not
 

613
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,630
it'll just say can't connect if it's not
there

614
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:42,640
there
 

615
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,480
there
so should be alright yeah so that'll be

616
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,490
so should be alright yeah so that'll be
 

617
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,230
so should be alright yeah so that'll be
a cool setup

618
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,240
a cool setup
 

619
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,310
a cool setup
I think Peter tried to say something a

620
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
I think Peter tried to say something a
 

621
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,610
I think Peter tried to say something a

Fache you can integrate with next cloud

680
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:33,550
Fache you can integrate with next cloud
 

681
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,870
Fache you can integrate with next cloud
and Google accounts you can import

682
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
and Google accounts you can import
 

683
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,780
and Google accounts you can import
contacts and calendar stuff from that

684
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:38,790
contacts and calendar stuff from that
 

685
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,700
contacts and calendar stuff from that
but I told him I wanted to know if you

686
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:41,710
but I told him I wanted to know if you
 

687
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,230
but I told him I wanted to know if you
could sync with private contact card

688
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,240
could sync with private contact card
 

689
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,700
could sync with private contact card
servers and kalyn on servers is that

690
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:44,710
servers and kalyn on servers is that
 

691
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,230
servers and kalyn on servers is that
what you mean yes sir that's correct

692
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
what you mean yes sir that's correct
 

693
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,040
what you mean yes sir that's correct
yeah comment about next cloud though

694
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,050
yeah comment about next cloud though
 

695
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,810
yeah comment about next cloud though
because next cloud can be self hosted

696
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:51,820
because next cloud can be self hosted
 

697
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,360
because next cloud can be self hosted
right yeah right well I'm actually on

698
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,370
right yeah right well I'm actually on
 

699
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,520
right yeah right well I'm actually on
the Oh phone Oh website right now trying

700
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,530
the Oh phone Oh website right now trying
 

701
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,240
the Oh phone Oh website right now trying
to figure out what the capabilities are

702
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,250
to figure out what the capabilities are
 

703
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,830
to figure out what the capabilities are
be really surprised if something like

704
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:04,840
be really surprised if something like
 

705
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,530
be really surprised if something like
that wasn't already written though me

706
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:07,540
that wasn't already written though me
 

707
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,870
that wasn't already written though me
too that's why I'm sort of hesitating to

708
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:09,880
too that's why I'm sort of hesitating to
 

709
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,480
too that's why I'm sort of hesitating to
build it initially I definitely want to

710
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,490
build it initially I definitely want to
 

711
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,720
build it initially I definitely want to
go look to see what yeah first and

712
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:15,730
go look to see what yeah first and
 

713
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,060
go look to see what yeah first and
there's no point reinventing the wheel

714
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,070
there's no point reinventing the wheel
 

715
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,700
there's no point reinventing the wheel
yeah I think what's interesting about

716
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:20,710
yeah I think what's interesting about
 

717
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,680
yeah I think what's interesting about
the pine phone is because it's going to

718
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:22,690
the pine phone is because it's going to
 

719
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,890
the pine phone is because it's going to
be running true Linux

720
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:24,900
be running true Linux
 

721
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,290
be running true Linux
you know there's CalDAV connectors and

722
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:28,300
you know there's CalDAV connectors and
 

723
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,140
you know there's CalDAV connectors and
stuff out there for Linux so if those

724
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,150
stuff out there for Linux so if those
 

725
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,060
stuff out there for Linux so if those
could be installed on the pine phone I

726
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,070
could be installed on the pine phone I
 

727
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,280
could be installed on the pine phone I
think it would it'll just work right

728
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,290
think it would it'll just work right
 

729
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,230
think it would it'll just work right
well they have to work without finally I

730
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,240
well they have to work without finally I
 

731
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,210
well they have to work without finally I
mean the thing is right phone there has

732
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,220
mean the thing is right phone there has
 

733
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,400
mean the thing is right phone there has
to be able to call them and if the guess

734
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,410
to be able to call them and if the guess
 

735
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,620
to be able to call them and if the guess
if there aren't any hooks in there for I

736
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:43,630
if there aren't any hooks in there for I
 

737
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,960
if there aren't any hooks in there for I
find out to call something then it's

738
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:45,970
find out to call something then it's
 

739
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,289
find out to call something then it's
just not going to work so they have to

740
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:49,299
just not going to work so they have to
 

741
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:50,759
just not going to work so they have to
they have to decide what they want to

742
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:50,769
they have to decide what they want to
 

743
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,639
they have to decide what they want to
talk to ya this is the thing right it's

744
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:53,649
talk to ya this is the thing right it's
 

745
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:55,289
talk to ya this is the thing right it's
gonna be like a demon or something

746
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:55,299
gonna be like a demon or something
 

747
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,960
gonna be like a demon or something
that's serving up CalDAV data and most

748
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:57,970
that's serving up CalDAV data and most
 

749
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,159
that's serving up CalDAV data and most
of the phone applications have their own

750
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:01,169
of the phone applications have their own
 

751
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:05,519
of the phone applications have their own
implementations of encoding and eternity

752
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:05,529
implementations of encoding and eternity
 

753
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:09,180
implementations of encoding and eternity
the V codes yes and is this going to be

754
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,190
the V codes yes and is this going to be
 

755
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,070
the V codes yes and is this going to be
a quick a case of well we'll just

756
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,080
a quick a case of well we'll just
 

757
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,100
a quick a case of well we'll just
include our own implementation and be

758
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,110
include our own implementation and be
 

759
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,229
include our own implementation and be
done with it well if they do that okay

760
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:16,239
done with it well if they do that okay
 

761
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:18,479
done with it well if they do that okay
that's yet another implementation that

762
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:18,489
that's yet another implementation that
 

763
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:28,080
that's yet another implementation that
could go back but there's a lot of a lot

764
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,090
could go back but there's a lot of a lot
 

765
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,649
could go back but there's a lot of a lot
of folks who say that the the V code

766
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:31,659
of folks who say that the the V code
 

767
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,139
of folks who say that the the V code
implementation is inherently broken it

768
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:34,149
implementation is inherently broken it
 

769
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,119
implementation is inherently broken it
should be done some other way but they

770
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:36,129
should be done some other way but they
 

771
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,499
should be done some other way but they
really can't come up with a good

772
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:37,509
really can't come up with a good
 

773
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:47,789
really can't come up with a good
solution so I don't know how response

774
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:47,799
solution so I don't know how response
 

775
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,070
solution so I don't know how response
that and but we got from the forum

776
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
that and but we got from the forum
 

777
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,259
that and but we got from the forum

1021
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,070
one of these in the back of your 1u case
yes that's exactly what I was thinking

1022
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,080
yes that's exactly what I was thinking
 

1023
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,130
yes that's exactly what I was thinking
about and then and then we have a 12 amp

1024
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,140
about and then and then we have a 12 amp
 

1025
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,070
about and then and then we have a 12 amp
power converter the converts from

1026
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
power converter the converts from
 

1027
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,260
power converter the converts from
whatever voltage to whatever voltage

1028
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,270
