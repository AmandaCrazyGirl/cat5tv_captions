626
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:20,770
done a lot with it in a long time
 

627
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:26,940
done a lot with it in a long time
although my grandson is so working on

628
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:26,950
although my grandson is so working on
 

629
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:34,680
although my grandson is so working on
always gaming in using a called now just

630
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:34,690
always gaming in using a called now just
 

631
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,050
always gaming in using a called now just
just recently and and but involves some

632
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,060
just recently and and but involves some
 

633
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,600
just recently and and but involves some
c-sharp scripts so I we're working on

634
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:45,610
c-sharp scripts so I we're working on
 

635
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,820
c-sharp scripts so I we're working on
that together my my grandson's nine

636
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:47,830
that together my my grandson's nine
 

637
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:54,030
that together my my grandson's nine
years old so he he's been messing around

638
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,040
years old so he he's been messing around
 

639
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,120
years old so he he's been messing around
with that it's pretty impressive what do

640
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,130
with that it's pretty impressive what do
 

641
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,430
with that it's pretty impressive what do
you what he knows and understands

642
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
you what he knows and understands
 

643
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,600
you what he knows and understands
already at nine years old yeah Ron get

already at nine years old yeah Ron get
him in to get him into dog chained

646
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:06,940
him in to get him into dog chained
 

647
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,740
him in to get him into dog chained
programming block chain absolutely I

648
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:10,750
programming block chain absolutely I
 

649
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,550
programming block chain absolutely I
mean starting with JavaScript and then

650
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:13,560
mean starting with JavaScript and then
 

651
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,670
mean starting with JavaScript and then
maybe Python that's it and all those

652
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:17,680
maybe Python that's it and all those
 

653
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,550
maybe Python that's it and all those
languages in blockchain are based on

languages in blockchain are based on
 

655
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,800
languages in blockchain are based on
those we're basically on those two yeah

batch over printing because at the
 

707
00:22:53,570 --> 00:23:00,430
batch over printing because at the
system that run was at that time it was

708
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,440
system that run was at that time it was
 

709
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,160
system that run was at that time it was
eighteen years old and no one has the

710
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,170
eighteen years old and no one has the
 

711
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,500
eighteen years old and no one has the
source code and the company who made it

712
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,510
source code and the company who made it
 

713
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,740
source code and the company who made it
business 15 years ago no one had the

714
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:11,750
business 15 years ago no one had the
 

715
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,570
business 15 years ago no one had the
source code and they have I think they

716
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:13,580
source code and they have I think they
 

717
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,120
source code and they have I think they
even managed to get hold of one or two

718
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,130
even managed to get hold of one or two
 

719
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,130
even managed to get hold of one or two
of their developers who made the program

720
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,140
of their developers who made the program
 

721
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,680
of their developers who made the program
and no one had the source code and no

and no one had the source code and no
 

723
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:35,500
and no one had the source code and no
one had any idea how to check if it was

724
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,510
one had any idea how to check if it was
 

725
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,690
one had any idea how to check if it was
my uncle the yeah I'm guessing that they

726
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:40,700
my uncle the yeah I'm guessing that they
 

727
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,240
my uncle the yeah I'm guessing that they
had tried that but it was a successful

728
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,250
had tried that but it was a successful
 

729
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,500
had tried that but it was a successful
for some reason and I also remember that

730
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,510
for some reason and I also remember that
 

731
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:53,320
for some reason and I also remember that
there when the turn did happen I read

732
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,330
there when the turn did happen I read
 

733
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,290
there when the turn did happen I read
that the only system that actually I had

734
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:56,300
that the only system that actually I had
 

735
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,550
that the only system that actually I had
a crash due to their y2k was some

736
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:02,560

 

737
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,770

governmental large system in China but

governmental large system in China but
 

739
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,460

oh yeah I remember those days for there
everybody was in an uproar getting it

746
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:19,179
everybody was in an uproar getting it
 

747
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:22,880
everybody was in an uproar getting it
because all the computer dates were just

748
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:22,890
because all the computer dates were just
 

749
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,039
because all the computer dates were just
for two digits for the years they've

750

machines yfk was big business all you
 

755
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,900
machines yfk was big business all you
have to do this circumvent this first a

756
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:39,910
have to do this circumvent this first a
 

757
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,690
have to do this circumvent this first a
computer the record first to enter the

758
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:42,700
computer the record first to enter the
 

759
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,600
computer the record first to enter the
date manually and then it changed from

760
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:45,610
date manually and then it changed from
 

761
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:50,880
date manually and then it changed from
nineteen to twenty that you first they'd

762
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:50,890
nineteen to twenty that you first they'd
 

763
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,610
nineteen to twenty that you first they'd
said change automatically so you all

764
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:53,620
said change automatically so you all
 

765
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,100
said change automatically so you all
have to enter the date manual and then

00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,280
managed to fix the Year 30 in 2038 a
 

785
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,159
managed to fix the Year 30 in 2038 a

786
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:53,169
32-bit date in integer and rolls around
 

787
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:59,940

how it does yeah and then by that time

788
00:25:59,940 --> 00:25:59,950
how it does yeah and then by that time

most people should have their switch
 

791
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,500
most people should have their switch
away from the 32-bit operating systems

792
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:04,510
away from the 32-bit operating systems
 

793
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,460
away from the 32-bit operating systems
also yeah but it turns out that indeed

794
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,470
also yeah but it turns out that indeed
 

795
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,289
also yeah but it turns out that indeed
there's a few special cases that they

00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:10,299
there's a few special cases that they
 

797
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,149
there's a few special cases that they
can't do that for in the medical

798
