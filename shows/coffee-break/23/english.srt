we've also got a diesel generator so as

328
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,490
we've also got a diesel generator so as
 

329
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,999
we've also got a diesel generator so as
soon as the power goes off the UPS kicks

330
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:19,009
soon as the power goes off the UPS kicks
 

331
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,429
soon as the power goes off the UPS kicks
in and it powers all the outlets in the

332
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:21,439
in and it powers all the outlets in the
 

333
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:24,100
in and it powers all the outlets in the
place and then the diesel generator

334
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,110
place and then the diesel generator
 

335
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,379
place and then the diesel generator
comes on so the UPS is really only there

336
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:26,389
comes on so the UPS is really only there
 

337
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,600
comes on so the UPS is really only there
for the you know 10-15 seconds it takes

338
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:28,610
for the you know 10-15 seconds it takes
 

339
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,799
for the you know 10-15 seconds it takes
for the diesel to kick in

340
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:29,809
for the diesel to kick in
 

341
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,749
for the diesel to kick in
and then the diesel just will run and

342
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:31,759
and then the diesel just will run and
 

343
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,419
and then the diesel just will run and
run and run and it I don't know how they

344
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:34,429
run and run and it I don't know how they
 

345

was gonna say till the diesel runs out

was gonna say till the diesel runs out
 

351
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,509
was gonna say till the diesel runs out
but it doesn't they don't ever have to

but it doesn't they don't ever have to
 

353
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,329
but it doesn't they don't ever have to
put diesel in it so they must have gas

354
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:46,339

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:59,390
I have some deep theory to talk to you
about I'm good I'm good at geekery thank

472
00:14:59,390 --> 00:14:59,400
about I'm good I'm good at geekery thank
 

473
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,430
about I'm good I'm good at geekery thank
you I appreciate that I have been

474
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
you I appreciate that I have been
 

475
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,130
you I appreciate that I have been
researching fine time some more because

476
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,140
researching fine time some more because
 

477
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,740
researching fine time some more because
I've been trying to figure out how the

478
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:09,750
I've been trying to figure out how the
 

479
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,460
I've been trying to figure out how the
hand movement should work and I think

480
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:13,470
hand movement should work and I think
 

481
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,810
hand movement should work and I think
it's okay to to let the second hand just

482
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:17,820
it's okay to to let the second hand just
 

483
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,920
it's okay to to let the second hand just
go click click click click and I think

484
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:21,930
go click click click click and I think
 

485
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,260
go click click click click and I think
it's ok to let the minute hand just go

486
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,270
it's ok to let the minute hand just go
 

487
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,840
it's ok to let the minute hand just go
click click click for each minute that

488
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:26,850
click click click for each minute that
 

489
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,270
click click click for each minute that
ticks by yeah I can't do that with the

490
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,280
ticks by yeah I can't do that with the
 

491
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,490
ticks by yeah I can't do that with the
hour hand because if I did that with the

492
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:31,500
hour hand because if I did that with the
 

493
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,300
hour hand because if I did that with the
hour hand it would go from 12 o'clock or

494
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,310
hour hand it would go from 12 o'clock or
 

495
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,460
hour hand it would go from 12 o'clock or
and indistinct right - - yeah and then

496
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,470
and indistinct right - - yeah and then
 

497
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,470
and indistinct right - - yeah and then
jump I can't do that with you it would

498
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
jump I can't do that with you it would
 

499
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,390
jump I can't do that with you it would
look pretty it was a pretty day so I'm

500
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:47,400
look pretty it was a pretty day so I'm
 

501
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,700
look pretty it was a pretty day so I'm
gonna have to figure out where probably

502
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:49,710
gonna have to figure out where probably
 

503
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,540
gonna have to figure out where probably
every I think what I'll do is update the

504
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:53,550
every I think what I'll do is update the
 

505
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,579
every I think what I'll do is update the
hour-hand every five minutes just

506
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:55,589
hour-hand every five minutes just
 

507
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,519
hour-hand every five minutes just
because it's a 60 minute you know in

508
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:58,529
because it's a 60 minute you know in
 

509
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,130
because it's a 60 minute you know in
twelve twelve hour and all that so every

510
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,140
twelve twelve hour and all that so every
 

511
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,840
twelve twelve hour and all that so every
five minutes seems to be appropriate so

512
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:02,850
five minutes seems to be appropriate so
 

513
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,760
five minutes seems to be appropriate so
I think what I'll do is update the hour

514
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:04,770
I think what I'll do is update the hour
 

515
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,550
I think what I'll do is update the hour
hand position every five minutes so but

516
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:07,560
hand position every five minutes so but
 

517
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,950
hand position every five minutes so but
probably going to be something like that

518
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:09,960
probably going to be something like that
 

519
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,130
probably going to be something like that
right because it we did it in fact it

520
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,140
right because it we did it in fact it
 

521
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,880
right because it we did it in fact it
wouldn't say yeah yeah they move every

522
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:15,890
wouldn't say yeah yeah they move every
 

523
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,730
wouldn't say yeah yeah they move every
digit well yeah that's what it sounds

524
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:19,740
digit well yeah that's what it sounds
 

525
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,390
digit well yeah that's what it sounds
like yeah so is there a reason vp9 that

526
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:23,400
like yeah so is there a reason vp9 that
 

527
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,460
like yeah so is there a reason vp9 that
you couldn't update it like on regular

528
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,470
you couldn't update it like on regular
 

529
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,190
you couldn't update it like on regular
like I don't know ten second intervals

530
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,200
like I don't know ten second intervals
 

531
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,269
like I don't know ten second intervals
like is there is it gonna take too much

532
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:32,279
like is there is it gonna take too much
 

533
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,130
like is there is it gonna take too much
power that the pine time can't handle it

534
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,140
power that the pine time can't handle it
 

535
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,340
power that the pine time can't handle it

realize and recognize that the show is
 

679
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,800
realize and recognize that the show is
going to have to evolve through this so

680
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:49,810
going to have to evolve through this so
 

681
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,560
going to have to evolve through this so
we're gonna have to use zoom or some

682
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:52,570
we're gonna have to use zoom or some
 

683
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,300
we're gonna have to use zoom or some
similar technology but zoom is like the

684
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,310
similar technology but zoom is like the
 

685
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,880
similar technology but zoom is like the
easy which even tearful quickly you know

686
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:56,890
easy which even tearful quickly you know
 

687
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,120
easy which even tearful quickly you know
set up as a breeze kind of solution but

688
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,130
set up as a breeze kind of solution but
 

689
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,030
set up as a breeze kind of solution but
being able to get Sasha on from out east

690
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,040
being able to get Sasha on from out east
 

691
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
being able to get Sasha on from out east
for example you don't have to have a

692
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,050
for example you don't have to have a
 

693
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,810
for example you don't have to have a
solution in place in 40 minutes is not

694
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:06,820
solution in place in 40 minutes is not
 

695
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,280
solution in place in 40 minutes is not
going to be enough time and so of course

696
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,290
going to be enough time and so of course
 

697
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,860
going to be enough time and so of course
it's it's certainly worth the worth the

it's it's certainly worth the worth the
 

699
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,780
it's it's certainly worth the worth the

investment for us to have that to see
 

701
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,340
investment for us to have that to see

00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:37,219
hunt so that was kind of cool they had
 

781
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:41,190
hunt so that was kind of cool they had
over a thousand kids was being Minecraft

782
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,200
over a thousand kids was being Minecraft
 

783
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,070
over a thousand kids was being Minecraft
they did roblox and minecraft Oh No so

784
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,080
they did roblox and minecraft Oh No so
 

785
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,019
they did roblox and minecraft Oh No so
it started with roblox so they did that

786
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:47,029
it started with roblox so they did that
 

787
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,440
it started with roblox so they did that
for well from noon until 2:30 and then

788
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,450
for well from noon until 2:30 and then
 

789
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,379
for well from noon until 2:30 and then
at 2:30 they wrapped that up to get

790
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:53,389
at 2:30 they wrapped that up to get
 

791
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:55,509
at 2:30 they wrapped that up to get
ready for the Minecraft and they started

792
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:55,519
ready for the Minecraft and they started
 

793
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,959
ready for the Minecraft and they started
that at 3:00 and went till 4:00 so when

794
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:58,969
that at 3:00 and went till 4:00 so when
 

795
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,940
that at 3:00 and went till 4:00 so when
you had the multi service running you

796
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:00,950
you had the multi service running you
 

797
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,669
you had the multi service running you
had cameras that were virtual point of

798
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
had cameras that were virtual point of
 

799
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,259
had cameras that were virtual point of
view that was ooming around all over the

800
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:05,269
view that was ooming around all over the
 

801
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,959
view that was ooming around all over the
place right yeah yeah that was so it was

802
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:07,969
place right yeah yeah that was so it was
 

803
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:10,719
place right yeah yeah that was so it was
the same technology

804
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:10,729
the same technology
 

805
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,430
the same technology
I guess they they probably just had

806
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:12,440
I guess they they probably just had
 

807
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,899
I guess they they probably just had
their player in there somewhere

808
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:13,909
their player in there somewhere
 

809
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:16,299
their player in there somewhere
okay and so what what the viewers on

810
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:16,309
okay and so what what the viewers on
 

811
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:19,089
okay and so what what the viewers on
Zoom we're seeing was kind of a wide

812
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:19,099
Zoom we're seeing was kind of a wide
 

813
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,669
Zoom we're seeing was kind of a wide
shot of the world with all the kids

814
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
shot of the world with all the kids
 

815
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,070
shot of the world with all the kids
running around

816
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,080
running around
 

817
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,070
running around
that's cool yeah that was pretty neat

818
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,080
that's cool yeah that was pretty neat
 

819
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,750
that's cool yeah that was pretty neat
how they use technology to do that so so

820
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
how they use technology to do that so so
 

821
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,639
how they use technology to do that so so
how far into the geekery did I feel like

822
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:33,649
how far into the geekery did I feel like
 

823
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:36,100
how far into the geekery did I feel like
getting to before the before the

824
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,110
getting to before the before the
 

825
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,730
getting to before the before the
internet quit on me yeah where do we get

826
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:39,740
internet quit on me yeah where do we get
 

827
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,409
internet quit on me yeah where do we get
I had a question for you and I forget

828
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:41,419
I had a question for you and I forget
 

829
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,639
I had a question for you and I forget
whatever yes oh okay I think I got as

830
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:45,649
whatever yes oh okay I think I got as
 

831
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,950
whatever yes oh okay I think I got as
far as I was asking I was asking about

832
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:47,960
far as I was asking I was asking about
 

833
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,630
far as I was asking I was asking about
the performance if there was a reason

834
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:49,640
the performance if there was a reason
 

835
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,539
the performance if there was a reason
that you were looking to go with such

836
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:52,549
that you were looking to go with such
 

837
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,610
that you were looking to go with such
increments or like is it a performance

838
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:54,620
increments or like is it a performance
 

839
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,340
increments or like is it a performance
thing or do you think that the that the

840
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,350
thing or do you think that the that the
 

841
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,529
thing or do you think that the that the
pine phone or the pine time could

842
00:24:59,529 --> 00:24:59,539
pine phone or the pine time could
 

843
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,810
pine phone or the pine time could
actually do increments even more

844
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:01,820
actually do increments even more
 

845
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,100
actually do increments even more
frequently without it affecting

846
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,110
frequently without it affecting
 

847
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,960
frequently without it affecting
performance like could you do for

848
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:04,970
performance like could you do for
 

849
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,139
performance like could you do for
example ten second increments for the

850
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:08,149
example ten second increments for the
 

851
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:11,440
example ten second increments for the
hour hand I could I could but the thing

852
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:11,450
hour hand I could I could but the thing
 

853
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,620
hour hand I could I could but the thing
is that the X Y coordinates from the

854
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:14,630
is that the X Y coordinates from the
 

855
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,620
is that the X Y coordinates from the
center to wherever the hour hand you

856
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:17,630
center to wherever the hour hand you
 

857
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,009
center to wherever the hour hand you
know it's tends to for some period of

858
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:21,019
know it's tends to for some period of
 

859
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,509
know it's tends to for some period of
time because of the resolution of the

860
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:22,519
time because of the resolution of the
 

861
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,600
time because of the resolution of the
screen it's not going to move anyway you

862
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:25,610
screen it's not going to move anyway you
 

863
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,169
screen it's not going to move anyway you
know between ah between the first minute

864
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:29,179
know between ah between the first minute
 

865
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,299
know between ah between the first minute
and the fifth minute it's very likely

866
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:31,309
and the fifth minute it's very likely
 

867
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:34,090
and the fifth minute it's very likely
that the XY coordinate of that hour hand

868
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,100
that the XY coordinate of that hour hand
 

869
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,419
that the XY coordinate of that hour hand
is going to be the same around often as

870
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:37,429
is going to be the same around often as
 

871
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:39,850
is going to be the same around often as
I want but only just redrawing the same

872
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:39,860
I want but only just redrawing the same
 

873
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,950
I want but only just redrawing the same
location each time it doesn't make they

874
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:41,960
location each time it doesn't make they
 

875
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,060
location each time it doesn't make they
see yeah okay so I don't care too much

876
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,070
see yeah okay so I don't care too much
 

877
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,649
see yeah okay so I don't care too much
about the performance the I'm gonna try

878
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:50,659
about the performance the I'm gonna try
 

879
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,480
about the performance the I'm gonna try
and make it work first and it certainly

880
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:52,490
and make it work first and it certainly
 

881
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,669
and make it work first and it certainly
has to look good it doesn't need to be

882
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:54,679
has to look good it doesn't need to be
 

883
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,080
has to look good it doesn't need to be
you know so retro that literally the

884
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,090
you know so retro that literally the
 

885
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,669
you know so retro that literally the
hour-hand jumps from twelve o'clock to 1

886
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:00,679
hour-hand jumps from twelve o'clock to 1
 

887
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,289
hour-hand jumps from twelve o'clock to 1
o'clock and then one o'clock that that

888
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:02,299
o'clock and then one o'clock that that
 

889
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,830
o'clock and then one o'clock that that
would be a bit that would be a bit too

890
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:04,840
would be a bit that would be a bit too
 

891
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,830
would be a bit that would be a bit too
too too too crazy so yeah I can't wait

892
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840
too too too crazy so yeah I can't wait
 

893
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,169
too too too crazy so yeah I can't wait
to see how this looks I can't wait to

894
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:11,179
to see how this looks I can't wait to
 

895
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:12,190
to see how this looks I can't wait to
hear her though we've had this thing

896
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,200
hear her though we've had this thing
 

897
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,139
hear her though we've had this thing
Shep you like that one it should be

898
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:14,149
Shep you like that one it should be
 

899
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:25,539
Shep you like that one it should be
opening soon yeah I just got to figure

900
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:25,549
opening soon yeah I just got to figure
 

901
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,909
opening soon yeah I just got to figure
out how one time interval is I just

902
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:27,919
out how one time interval is I just
 

903
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,240
out how one time interval is I just
haven't done the calculations yet but I

904
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,250
haven't done the calculations yet but I
 

905
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,549
haven't done the calculations yet but I
was also looking at the at the pine

906
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:33,559
was also looking at the at the pine
 

907
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,279
was also looking at the at the pine
phone and specifically looking at the Oh

908
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:36,289
phone and specifically looking at the Oh
 

909
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,090
phone and specifically looking at the Oh
phone oh application

910
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,100
phone oh application
 

911
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,740
phone oh application
that I had questions from boa about a

912
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:39,750
that I had questions from boa about a
 

913
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,310
that I had questions from boa about a
couple of days ago and so there's not

914
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,320
couple of days ago and so there's not
 

915
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,779
couple of days ago and so there's not
not actually much in the way of

916
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:44,789
not actually much in the way of
 

917
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:46,970
not actually much in the way of
documentation on the website so I just

918
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:46,980
documentation on the website so I just
 

919
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,549
documentation on the website so I just
went ahead and downloaded the thing yeah

920
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:49,559
went ahead and downloaded the thing yeah
 

921
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,440
went ahead and downloaded the thing yeah
download it builds I got it to build

922
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,450
download it builds I got it to build
 

923
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,740
download it builds I got it to build
them both me my Linux boxes I don't

924
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:54,750
them both me my Linux boxes I don't
 

925
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,270
them both me my Linux boxes I don't
think it'll run I haven't tried to run

926
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:56,280
think it'll run I haven't tried to run
 

927
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,270
think it'll run I haven't tried to run
it yet but it which does feel and I've

928
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,280
it yet but it which does feel and I've
 

929
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,700
it yet but it which does feel and I've
been researching the code it uses this

930
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:01,710
been researching the code it uses this
 

931
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,490
been researching the code it uses this
thing called D bus have you ever used B

932
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:04,500
thing called D bus have you ever used B
 

933
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,580
thing called D bus have you ever used B
bus Robbie or no I mean I know that I

934
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:07,590
bus Robbie or no I mean I know that I
 

935
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,279
bus Robbie or no I mean I know that I
have but I can't recall it was for

936
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:10,289
have but I can't recall it was for
 

937
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:13,070
have but I can't recall it was for
whatever zone D bus looks very much like

938
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,080
whatever zone D bus looks very much like
 

939
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,940
whatever zone D bus looks very much like
what what I'm used to back when I worked

940
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:16,950
what what I'm used to back when I worked
 

941
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,080
what what I'm used to back when I worked
in the core BER world it's a message bus

942
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,090
in the core BER world it's a message bus
 

943
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,350
in the core BER world it's a message bus
where you stick a message in one end you

944
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:24,360
where you stick a message in one end you
 

945
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,880
where you stick a message in one end you
know if you're a publisher you'll put a

946
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:25,890
know if you're a publisher you'll put a
 

947
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,549
know if you're a publisher you'll put a
messaging money and those that message

948
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
messaging money and those that message
 

949
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,510
messaging money and those that message
bus just lets those messages travel all

950
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:32,520
bus just lets those messages travel all
 

951
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,500
bus just lets those messages travel all
across the the bus and anybody who's

952
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:36,510
across the the bus and anybody who's
 

953
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,850
across the the bus and anybody who's
interested in the message will will

954
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:40,860
interested in the message will will
 

955
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,220
interested in the message will will
consume that message and we'll take out

956
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,230
consume that message and we'll take out
 

957
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,580
consume that message and we'll take out
okay if they've got any interest on it

958
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:45,590
okay if they've got any interest on it
 

959
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:51,430
okay if they've got any interest on it
so it looks like that how oh so no works

960
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
so it looks like that how oh so no works
 

961
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,020
so it looks like that how oh so no works
there is no as far as I can see there

962
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,030
there is no as far as I can see there
 

963
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,299
there is no as far as I can see there
isn't a UI component to it so there's

964
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:56,309
isn't a UI component to it so there's
 

965
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,510
isn't a UI component to it so there's
not there's no part to it that says go

966
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
not there's no part to it that says go
 

967
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,049
not there's no part to it that says go
display this this dial pad you know the

968
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:03,059
display this this dial pad you know the
 

969
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,240
display this this dial pad you know the
the number pad to dolly yeah it must be

970
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,250
the number pad to dolly yeah it must be
 

971
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,980
the number pad to dolly yeah it must be
a separate application that does that

972
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:06,990
a separate application that does that
 

973
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,470
a separate application that does that
and that separate application must use

974
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:09,480
and that separate application must use
 

975
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,299
and that separate application must use
the D bus to talk to odd phone oh and

976
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:14,309
the D bus to talk to odd phone oh and
 

977
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:17,180
the D bus to talk to odd phone oh and
it's trigger off now out phone oh by the

978
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,190
it's trigger off now out phone oh by the
 

979
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,100
it's trigger off now out phone oh by the
way has to react when for instance

980
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,110
way has to react when for instance
 

981
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,649
way has to react when for instance
there's an incoming phone call or a text

982
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:21,659
there's an incoming phone call or a text
 

983
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,360
there's an incoming phone call or a text
message comes in or something like that

984
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,370
message comes in or something like that
 

985
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,700
message comes in or something like that
and so it has to put a message on the

986
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:25,710
and so it has to put a message on the
 

987
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,560
and so it has to put a message on the
bus to say hey I got a phone call what

988
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:27,570
bus to say hey I got a phone call what
 

989
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,779
bus to say hey I got a phone call what
do you want me to do about it or I got a

990
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:29,789
do you want me to do about it or I got a
 

991
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:32,600
do you want me to do about it or I got a
text message yeah go somebody somebody

992
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:32,610
text message yeah go somebody somebody
 

993
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,399
text message yeah go somebody somebody
go display this here's the message I

994
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:34,409
go display this here's the message I
 

995
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,529
go display this here's the message I
don't care about anything after that is

996
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:36,539
don't care about anything after that is
 

997
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:40,190
don't care about anything after that is
the message just send it on it does have

998
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,200
the message just send it on it does have
 

999
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,590
the message just send it on it does have
functionality to take any contacts that

1000
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:42,600
functionality to take any contacts that
 

1001
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,320
functionality to take any contacts that
are in a SIM card which won't be many

1002
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,330
are in a SIM card which won't be many
 

1003
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,680
are in a SIM card which won't be many
it'll be like 200 messages or 200

1004
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:48,690
it'll be like 200 messages or 200
 

1005
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,140
it'll be like 200 messages or 200
contacts or something and it can convert

1006
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,150
contacts or something and it can convert
 

1007
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,680
contacts or something and it can convert
those two

1008
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,690
those two
 

1009
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,200
those two
very rudimentary use a card and then

1010
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,210
very rudimentary use a card and then
 

1011
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,810
very rudimentary use a card and then
export those it is it can do that but

1012
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:56,820
export those it is it can do that but
 

1013
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,930
export those it is it can do that but
that's all it does so there's no other v

1014
00:28:59,930 --> 00:28:59,940
that's all it does so there's no other v
 

1015
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,840
that's all it does so there's no other v
card or other connectivity in that in

1016
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:02,850
card or other connectivity in that in
 

1017
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,909
card or other connectivity in that in
that application but I'm aware also be

1018
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:04,919
that application but I'm aware also be
 

1019
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,740
that application but I'm aware also be
p9 these are all the things that you're

1020
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:06,750
p9 these are all the things that you're
 

1021
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,779
p9 these are all the things that you're
learning just from reading the manuals

1022
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:08,789
learning just from reading the manuals
 

1023
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,379
learning just from reading the manuals
and reading the forum's no reading the

1024
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:12,389
and reading the forum's no reading the
 

1025
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:16,789
and reading the forum's no reading the
source code reading code okay so I can't

1026
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
source code reading code okay so I can't
 

1027
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,210
source code reading code okay so I can't
imagine okay I can't imagine how much

1028
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,220
imagine okay I can't imagine how much
 

1029
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,830
imagine okay I can't imagine how much
you're gonna learn and how how quickly

1030
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:21,840
you're gonna learn and how how quickly
 

1031
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,990
you're gonna learn and how how quickly
you're gonna come up with ideas once you

1032
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
you're gonna come up with ideas once you
 

1033
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,759
you're gonna come up with ideas once you
have the actual device and can start

1034
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:25,769
have the actual device and can start
 

1035
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:28,009
have the actual device and can start
tinkering oh I can't eat I can take her

1036
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:28,019
tinkering oh I can't eat I can take her
 

1037
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,169
tinkering oh I can't eat I can take her
now because the device will be running

1038
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:30,179
now because the device will be running
 

1039
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,779
now because the device will be running
Linux so I can build all this stuff on

1040
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:32,789
Linux so I can build all this stuff on
 

1041
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:36,230
Linux so I can build all this stuff on
my desktop to get it to work and then

1042
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
my desktop to get it to work and then
 

1043
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,779
my desktop to get it to work and then
literally just the only question I have

1044
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:38,789
literally just the only question I have
 

1045
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:43,070
literally just the only question I have
in mind is when the prime phone runs the

1046
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,080
in mind is when the prime phone runs the
 

1047
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,529
in mind is when the prime phone runs the
Linux by default you have to log on with

1048
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:45,539
Linux by default you have to log on with
 

1049
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,690
Linux by default you have to log on with
a username password before you get any

1050
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:47,700
a username password before you get any
 

1051
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,350
a username password before you get any
access at all now the main phone if it's

1052
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
access at all now the main phone if it's
 

1053
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,240
access at all now the main phone if it's
running Linux it must log on with the

1054
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,250
running Linux it must log on with the
 

1055
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,369
running Linux it must log on with the
default user password and it must be a

1056
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:55,379
default user password and it must be a
 

1057
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,560
default user password and it must be a
non root password it would be crazy to

1058
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:57,570
non root password it would be crazy to
 

1059
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:03,129
non root password it would be crazy to
to run run as a root user on that device

1060

to run run as a root user on that device
 

1061
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:05,899
to run run as a root user on that device
what are the capabilities here how do I

1062
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:05,909
what are the capabilities here how do I
 

1063
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:08,060
what are the capabilities here how do I
build this so that it works in a user

1064
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,070
build this so that it works in a user
 

1065
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,700
build this so that it works in a user

yep so I've got a figural lenio figure
it hair metal runs and the question

1082
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:32,639
it hair metal runs and the question
 

1083
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,669
it hair metal runs and the question
there is going to be under what context

1084
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:34,679
there is going to be under what context
 

1085
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,549
there is going to be under what context
us a phono run does it permit a system
