411
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,400
my piehole and a little mask that I've
got going as well but it's a similar

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,410
got going as well but it's a similar
 

413
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,320
got going as well but it's a similar
configuration so the question still

414

stands right I have have the issue it's
 

417
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,790
stands right I have have the issue it's
a sorry I have numerous different SBC's

numerous and yet the raspberry PI's are
 

421
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,810
numerous and yet the raspberry PI's are
the only ones that corrupt the SD cards

the only ones that corrupt the SD cards
 

423
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,220
the only ones that corrupt the SD cards
that's it yeah it's a problem inherent

that's it yeah it's a problem inherent
 

425
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,960
that's it yeah it's a problem inherent
to raspberry pi specifically so a no

624
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:37,139
single unit for the PI's and a bunch of
 

625
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:39,680
single unit for the PI's and a bunch of
them that didn't need more current and

626
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:39,690
them that didn't need more current and
 

627
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,629
them that didn't need more current and
that single unit can provide because

628
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:41,639
that single unit can provide because
 

629
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:45,279
that single unit can provide because
that single unit can provide up to 2.4 o

630
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:45,289
that single unit can provide up to 2.4 o
 

631
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,289
that single unit can provide up to 2.4 o
slot yeah some of the board's need at

632
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:48,299
slot yeah some of the board's need at
 

633
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,690
slot yeah some of the board's need at
least three so yeah those have to be on

634
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:50,700
least three so yeah those have to be on
 

635
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,519
least three so yeah those have to be on
their own little bricks that'll be

636
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:52,529
their own little bricks that'll be
 

637
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:54,289
their own little bricks that'll be
interesting to to see because I

638
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:54,299
interesting to to see because I
 

639
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,539
interesting to to see because I
understand that like each wall war is

640
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:56,549
understand that like each wall war is
 

641
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:57,950
understand that like each wall war is
gonna draw a certain amount of average

642
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:57,960
gonna draw a certain amount of average
 

643
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,779
gonna draw a certain amount of average
but it's kind of wasted right yeah to

644
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:01,789
but it's kind of wasted right yeah to
 

645
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:04,369
but it's kind of wasted right yeah to
take Bo's idea which is to use a

646
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:04,379
take Bo's idea which is to use a
 

647
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,100
take Bo's idea which is to use a
step-down converter right from like a 12

648
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,110
step-down converter right from like a 12
 

649
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,519
step-down converter right from like a 12
volt or a 24 volt and power every single

650
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:10,529
volt or a 24 volt and power every single
 

651
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,600
volt or a 24 volt and power every single
board from that that might be sort of a

652
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:14,610
board from that that might be sort of a
 

653
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,359
board from that that might be sort of a
little more power - yeah I'd love to get

654
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,369
little more power - yeah I'd love to get
 

655
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:18,769
little more power - yeah I'd love to get
something like that instead of having

656
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:18,779
something like that instead of having
 

657
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,739
something like that instead of having
all these little bricks again yeah

658
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:21,749
all these little bricks again yeah
 

659
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:28,070
all these little bricks again yeah
that's gonna be a fun experiment for you

660
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,080
that's gonna be a fun experiment for you
 

661
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,039
that's gonna be a fun experiment for you
anyway which barely goes bang anywhere

take the mains they don't need to DC
then like what he took up transistors

670
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:41,789
then like what he took up transistors

you know your way around Peter I'm gonna

678
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:57,570
you know your way around Peter I'm gonna
 

679
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,960
you know your way around Peter I'm gonna
take the easy way out and and just use

680
00:21:59,960 --> 00:21:59,970
take the easy way out and and just use
 

681
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,529
take the easy way out and and just use
like Bose had maybe like a laptop power

682
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:03,539
like Bose had maybe like a laptop power
 

683
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,749
like Bose had maybe like a laptop power
supply would be a good idea because they

684
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:05,759
supply would be a good idea because they
 

685
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,080
supply would be a good idea because they
provide like 19 volts and however man

686
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,090
provide like 19 volts and however man
 

687
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,030
provide like 19 volts and however man
right so I probably be able to power a

688
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,040
right so I probably be able to power a
 

689
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,800
right so I probably be able to power a
lot off of that without getting overly

690
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:12,810
lot off of that without getting overly
 

691
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,080
lot off of that without getting overly
complex when it comes to circuit

692
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,090
complex when it comes to circuit
 

693
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:22,880
complex when it comes to circuit
let's see what I can come up with

694
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:22,890
let's see what I can come up with
 

695
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,670
let's see what I can come up with
because I mean here at work we often

696
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:25,680
because I mean here at work we often
 

697
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,310
because I mean here at work we often
have like a waste that comes through as

698
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
have like a waste that comes through as
 

699
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,670
have like a waste that comes through as
we do a waste recycling so we'll often

700
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:31,680
we do a waste recycling so we'll often
 

701
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,670
we do a waste recycling so we'll often
have like a handful of 19 volt 24 volt

702
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:34,680
have like a handful of 19 volt 24 volt
 

703
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,010
have like a handful of 19 volt 24 volt
power bricks so I'll try to find one

704
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,020
power bricks so I'll try to find one
 

705
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,120
power bricks so I'll try to find one
that you know it's going to go to the

706
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,130
that you know it's going to go to the
 

707
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,210
that you know it's going to go to the
waste anyways and then step that down to

708
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,220
waste anyways and then step that down to
 

709
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,480
waste anyways and then step that down to
5 volts see how many apps we draw but

710
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,490
5 volts see how many apps we draw but
 

711
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,630
5 volts see how many apps we draw but
like here's one of the one of the little

712
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:49,640
like here's one of the one of the little
 

713
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,460
like here's one of the one of the little
power supplies for ESP see it's in 12

714
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,470
power supplies for ESP see it's in 12
 

715
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,140
power supplies for ESP see it's in 12
volt it only draws 4.6 amps when it

716
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,150
volt it only draws 4.6 amps when it
 

717
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:04,520
volt it only draws 4.6 amps when it
outputs it outputs 3 AC yeah yeah

718
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,530
outputs it outputs 3 AC yeah yeah
 

719
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,380
outputs it outputs 3 AC yeah yeah
because I have to be careful if I have

720
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,390
because I have to be careful if I have
 

721
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,300
because I have to be careful if I have
too many plugged in I can end up blowing

722
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,310
too many plugged in I can end up blowing
 

723
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,840
too many plugged in I can end up blowing
the circuit breaker

724
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:13,850

 

725
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,080

Highschool 30 years ago there was an

726
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,090
Highschool 30 years ago there was an
 

727
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,230
Highschool 30 years ago there was an
older power station that was that closed

728
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,240
older power station that was that closed
 

729
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,980
older power station that was that closed
down

730
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:21,990
down
 

731
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,470
down
it was shot down in the 60s I wouldn't

732
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
it was shot down in the 60s I wouldn't
 

733
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,950
it was shot down in the 60s I wouldn't
say but the dam and the pipes and the

734
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:27,960
say but the dam and the pipes and the
 

735
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,200
say but the dam and the pipes and the
equipment is still inside the station

736
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,210
equipment is still inside the station
 

737
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:40,030
equipment is still inside the station
when it was maybe they're lost DC power

738
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,040

 

739
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:48,980

everything if they wanted to a jam that

740
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:48,990
everything if they wanted to a jam that
 

741
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,990
everything if they wanted to a jam that
could start up on a DC power plant where

742
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
could start up on a DC power plant where
 

743
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,630
could start up on a DC power plant where
you pair that with my bare soil and

744
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
you pair that with my bare soil and
 

745
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,160
you pair that with my bare soil and
that's when the time when you would go

746
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,170
that's when the time when you would go
 

747
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,680
that's when the time when you would go
back because they don't they stop going

748
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:00,690
back because they don't they stop going
 

749
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,900
back because they don't they stop going
very doctorate in the goal and again you

750
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:02,910
very doctorate in the goal and again you
 

751
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:08,720
very doctorate in the goal and again you
go to a gap to get a beautifly that's

752
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:08,730
go to a gap to get a beautifly that's
 

753
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,320
go to a gap to get a beautifly that's
what I go back yeah it's starting to

754
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,330
what I go back yeah it's starting to
 

755
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,010
what I go back yeah it's starting to
make me think

756
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,020
make me think
 

757
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,870
make me think
would it be worth looking at solar

758
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
would it be worth looking at solar
 

759
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,770
would it be worth looking at solar
energy as well like

760
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:21,780

 

761
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,570

let's do like two about these ideas

762
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:23,580
let's do like two about these ideas
 

763
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,930
let's do like two about these ideas
you'd probably you know you did to

764
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:26,940
you'd probably you know you did to
 

765
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,360
you'd probably you know you did to
Georgia let you kill a job no job

766
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,370
Georgia let you kill a job no job
 

767
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,350
Georgia let you kill a job no job
yeah yeah yeah oh you have that in the

768
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,360
yeah yeah yeah oh you have that in the
 

769
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,950
yeah yeah yeah oh you have that in the
new studio I've got a skylight I wonder

770
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
new studio I've got a skylight I wonder
 

771
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,850
new studio I've got a skylight I wonder
if I could mount something

772
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:39,860
if I could mount something
 

773
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,200
if I could mount something
can you imagine if I was able to draw

774
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,210
can you imagine if I was able to draw
 

775
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,540
can you imagine if I was able to draw
like if I could get enough to to be able

776
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:44,550
like if I could get enough to to be able
 

777
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,120
like if I could get enough to to be able
to power a couple of SBC's we could do a

778
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,130
to power a couple of SBC's we could do a
 

779
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:52,280
to power a couple of SBC's we could do a
lot with that have a battery in there

780
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,290
lot with that have a battery in there
 

781
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:52,820
lot with that have a battery in there
somewhere

782
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:52,830
somewhere
 

783
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,890
somewhere
you can't you can't draw absolutely

784
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:54,900
you can't you can't draw absolutely
 

785
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,720
you can't you can't draw absolutely
absolutely I'm not talking direct draw

786
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:56,730
absolutely I'm not talking direct draw
 

787
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,240
absolutely I'm not talking direct draw
but like to be able to power it off of

788
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,250
but like to be able to power it off of
 

789
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,730
but like to be able to power it off of
some kind of because we're talking DC 12

790
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:01,740
some kind of because we're talking DC 12
 

791
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,570
some kind of because we're talking DC 12
volts right so I can probably power a

792
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:05,580
volts right so I can probably power a
 

793
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,250
volts right so I can probably power a
number of systems off of a single

794
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,260
number of systems off of a single
 

795
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,320
number of systems off of a single
battery yeah and if you do that I would

796
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,330
battery yeah and if you do that I would
 

797
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,660
battery yeah and if you do that I would
also advise to have some a small lamp or

798
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:14,670
also advise to have some a small lamp or
 

799
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,850
also advise to have some a small lamp or
something to be used as emergency lies

800
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:19,860
something to be used as emergency lies
 

801
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,090
something to be used as emergency lies
in case of power just imagine you know

802
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,100
in case of power just imagine you know
 

803
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,360
in case of power just imagine you know
in an officer with no windows it will be

804
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,370
in an officer with no windows it will be
 

805
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,210
in an officer with no windows it will be
quite dark when the power of minimus

806
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:29,220
quite dark when the power of minimus
 

807
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,750
quite dark when the power of minimus
power up evening yeah baby I will

808
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:32,760
power up evening yeah baby I will
 

809
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,970
power up evening yeah baby I will
welcome will I mean what we charge the

810
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:34,980
welcome will I mean what we charge the
 

811
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,030
welcome will I mean what we charge the
batteries 8,000 say my name sexual power

812
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,040
batteries 8,000 say my name sexual power
 

813
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,460
batteries 8,000 say my name sexual power
for that you could use probably Joe that

814
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:40,470
for that you could use probably Joe that
 

815
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,640
for that you could use probably Joe that
regard one and use one I think oh okay

816
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:43,650
regard one and use one I think oh okay
 

817
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,900
regard one and use one I think oh okay
yeah that makes sense

818
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:44,910
yeah that makes sense
 

819
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,970
yeah that makes sense
I wonder if there's some way like could

820
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:49,980
I wonder if there's some way like could
 

821
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,740
I wonder if there's some way like could
you failover so that if the battery

822
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:51,750
you failover so that if the battery
 

823
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,400
you failover so that if the battery
depleted could it fail over instantly

824
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,410
depleted could it fail over instantly
 

825
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,550
depleted could it fail over instantly
tomb and was there a circuit that could

826
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:58,560
tomb and was there a circuit that could
 

827
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,280
tomb and was there a circuit that could
do that without without any lost

828
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,290

 

829
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,680

something like a dead man quick it works

830
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:06,690
something like a dead man quick it works
 

831
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,390
something like a dead man quick it works
it usually works the other way around

832
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
it usually works the other way around
 

833
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,120
it usually works the other way around
though technically this is what I've got

834
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,130
though technically this is what I've got
 

835
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,480

as long as the power of mains it will

836
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,490
as long as the power of mains it will
 

837
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,910
as long as the power of mains it will
provide power to the range me domains

838
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:16,920
provide power to the range me domains
 

839
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,730
provide power to the range me domains
drop something at UPS the mindset of

840
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:19,740
drop something at UPS the mindset of
 

841
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,570
drop something at UPS the mindset of
that is to backup power if power is lost

842
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:23,580
that is to backup power if power is lost
 

843
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,910
that is to backup power if power is lost
but what if what if we flip that around

844
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:25,920
but what if what if we flip that around
 

845
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,550
but what if what if we flip that around
and said provide power but if there's

846
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:28,560
and said provide power but if there's
 

847
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
and said provide power but if there's
not enough sunlight or there's not

848
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:30,570
not enough sunlight or there's not
 

849
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,419
not enough sunlight or there's not
enough power in the batteries then sweep

850
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:32,429
enough power in the batteries then sweep
 

851
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:34,820
enough power in the batteries then sweep
back to the mains

852
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:34,830
back to the mains
 

853
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,910
back to the mains
it's assuming mind is available yeah and

854
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:40,920
it's assuming mind is available yeah and
 

855
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,860
it's assuming mind is available yeah and
I guess that kind of it you can easily

856
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:45,870
I guess that kind of it you can easily
 

857
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:52,610
I guess that kind of it you can easily
save 50 cents with your two thousand

I mean it's like you have to be up on

870
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:08,700
I mean it's like you have to be up on
 

871
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,360
I mean it's like you have to be up on
the roof I'm credible that means

872
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,370
the roof I'm credible that means
 

873
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,040
the roof I'm credible that means
drilling holes in the roof to let the

874
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,050
drilling holes in the roof to let the
 

875
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,010
drilling holes in the roof to let the

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,240
learned today boys is that my ideas are
 

887
00:27:39,240 --> 00:28:00,710
