there I've been working on like getting
 

45
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,490
there I've been working on like getting
things wired in so the last time I was

46
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500
things wired in so the last time I was
 

47
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,260
things wired in so the last time I was
there I did the audio rig so the

48
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,270
there I did the audio rig so the
 

49
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,140
there I did the audio rig so the
wireless microphones are all wired in I

50
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,150
wireless microphones are all wired in I
 

51
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,450
wireless microphones are all wired in I
don't have enough power outlets so I'm

52
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:17,460
don't have enough power outlets so I'm
 

53
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,880
don't have enough power outlets so I'm
still waiting for actually I think it

54
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:19,890
still waiting for actually I think it
 

55
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,770
still waiting for actually I think it

59
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,410
it up but they were supposed to have a
20 outlet power distribution unit for

60
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:30,420
20 outlet power distribution unit for
 

61
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,899
20 outlet power distribution unit for
the server was supposed to arrive last

62
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:32,909
the server was supposed to arrive last
 

63

today so so that's gonna give me enough
 

67
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,569
today so so that's gonna give me enough
power for everything right now I've got

68
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:38,579
power for everything right now I've got
 

69
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,160
power for everything right now I've got
everything wired in but I can't turn it

70
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,170
everything wired in but I can't turn it
 

71
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:52,340
everything wired in but I can't turn it
on pumping any circuit breakers I'm a

72
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,350
on pumping any circuit breakers I'm a
 

73
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,740
on pumping any circuit breakers I'm a
little afraid of that because being that

74
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:54,750
little afraid of that because being that
 

75
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,480
little afraid of that because being that
it you know we work after hours and

76
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,490
it you know we work after hours and
 

77
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,160
it you know we work after hours and
stuff it's gonna happen when they're

78
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,170
stuff it's gonna happen when they're
 

79
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,410
stuff it's gonna happen when they're
closed right when the mall is closed yep

80
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:00,420
closed right when the mall is closed yep
 

81
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,950
closed right when the mall is closed yep
plus they'll charge they'll charge me if

82
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:03,960
plus they'll charge they'll charge me if
 

83
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,200
plus they'll charge they'll charge me if
I trip a breaker like there will be a

84
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,210
I trip a breaker like there will be a
 

85
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,499
I trip a breaker like there will be a
fine for that so yeah because you

86
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:09,509
fine for that so yeah because you
 

87
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,890
fine for that so yeah because you
possibly impact other so I was may have

88
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:12,900
possibly impact other so I was may have
 

89
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,700
possibly impact other so I was may have
to consider

90
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:13,710
to consider
 

91
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,370
to consider
howling Ana yeah and plus they have to

92
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:19,380
howling Ana yeah and plus they have to
 

93
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,500
howling Ana yeah and plus they have to
have somebody go and trip it back again

94
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,510
have somebody go and trip it back again
 

95
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,020
have somebody go and trip it back again
right yeah have to pay their staff

96
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,030
right yeah have to pay their staff
 

97
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,050
right yeah have to pay their staff
surely one breaker would impact just one

98
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,060
surely one breaker would impact just one
 

99
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,380
surely one breaker would impact just one
unit right I would expect so yeah we'd

100
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,390
unit right I would expect so yeah we'd
 

101
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,510
unit right I would expect so yeah we'd
probably have isolated circuits for sure

102
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:32,520
probably have isolated circuits for sure
 

103
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,390
probably have isolated circuits for sure
but I don't know how many how many

104
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,400
but I don't know how many how many
 

105
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,240
but I don't know how many how many
circuits do I have do am i all on one

106
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,250
circuits do I have do am i all on one
 

107
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,300
circuits do I have do am i all on one
phase like these are things I don't know

108
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,310
phase like these are things I don't know
 

109
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,430
phase like these are things I don't know
so once I have the contractor in it

110
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
so once I have the contractor in it
 

111
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,690
so once I have the contractor in it
would be nice to get him up into the

112
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:44,700
would be nice to get him up into the
 

113
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,090
would be nice to get him up into the
drop ceiling and try to determine what

114
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,100
drop ceiling and try to determine what
 

115
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,310
drop ceiling and try to determine what
kind of wire and is actually happening

116
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:49,320
kind of wire and is actually happening
 

117
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,140
kind of wire and is actually happening
so he is actually going to do some

118
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,150
so he is actually going to do some
 

119
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,130
so he is actually going to do some
wiring for us

120
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,140
wiring for us
 

121
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,900
wiring for us
that was in the projected the plans

122
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:55,910
that was in the projected the plans
 

123
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,100
that was in the projected the plans
because we have a fair bit of lighting

124
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,110
because we have a fair bit of lighting
 

125
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,440
because we have a fair bit of lighting
that we have to put in and all that kind

126
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,450
that we have to put in and all that kind
 

127
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,340
that we have to put in and all that kind
of stuff so he's gonna put light

128
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,350
of stuff so he's gonna put light
 

129
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,130
of stuff so he's gonna put light
switches for all of the the studio lamps

130
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,140
switches for all of the the studio lamps
 

131
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,180
switches for all of the the studio lamps
and things like that yeah the other

132
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,190
and things like that yeah the other
 

133
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,160
and things like that yeah the other
thing that I'm doing bp9 is I'm trying

134
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,170
thing that I'm doing bp9 is I'm trying
 

135
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,380
thing that I'm doing bp9 is I'm trying
to reduce the power consumption by using

136
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,390
to reduce the power consumption by using
 

137
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,990
to reduce the power consumption by using
single board computers more yes you

138
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000
single board computers more yes you
 

139
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,990
single board computers more yes you
talked about that I remember yeah I had

140
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
talked about that I remember yeah I had
 

141
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,910
talked about that I remember yeah I had
a long chat with bow from Ameritrade

142
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
a long chat with bow from Ameritrade
 

143
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,990
a long chat with bow from Ameritrade
last night I'm just to kind of tap into

144
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
last night I'm just to kind of tap into
 

145
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,450
last night I'm just to kind of tap into
his knowledge with regards to how I can

146
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:26,460
his knowledge with regards to how I can
 

147
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,040
his knowledge with regards to how I can
set up Power Distribution and things

148
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,050
set up Power Distribution and things
 

149
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,330
set up Power Distribution and things
like that and I think we've come up with

150
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,340
like that and I think we've come up with
 

151
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,810
like that and I think we've come up with
some pretty neat solutions so I've got

152
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:32,820
some pretty neat solutions so I've got
 

153
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,300
some pretty neat solutions so I've got
the 1u chassis coming sometime whenever

154
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,310
the 1u chassis coming sometime whenever
 

155
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,510
the 1u chassis coming sometime whenever
Amazon gets it here then I found some

156
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:38,520
Amazon gets it here then I found some
 

157
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,450
Amazon gets it here then I found some
adhesive standoffs and Bill was

158
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:41,460
adhesive standoffs and Bill was
 

159
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,430
adhesive standoffs and Bill was
mentioning that because they're three

160
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
mentioning that because they're three
 

161
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,870
mentioning that because they're three
millimeters they may work with some

162
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:44,880
millimeters they may work with some
 

163
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,220
millimeters they may work with some
boards but not others because some

164
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,230
boards but not others because some
 

165
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,830
boards but not others because some
boards have really really tiny holes but

166
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:48,840
boards have really really tiny holes but
 

167
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,120
boards have really really tiny holes but
they're the you know the plastic

168
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,130
they're the you know the plastic
 

169
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,800
they're the you know the plastic
adhesive standoffs that you can just

170
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:51,810
adhesive standoffs that you can just
 

171
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,840
adhesive standoffs that you can just
stick into the chassis and then pop your

172
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:53,850
stick into the chassis and then pop your
 

173
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,510
stick into the chassis and then pop your
board onto it so so I was thinking take

174
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:56,520
board onto it so so I was thinking take
 

175
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,790
board onto it so so I was thinking take
as many single board computers as I can

176
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:58,800
as many single board computers as I can
 

177
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,130
as many single board computers as I can
possibly fit within this chassis and

178
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,140
possibly fit within this chassis and
 

179
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,740
possibly fit within this chassis and
just put these standoffs on the board

180
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:03,750
just put these standoffs on the board
 

181
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,890
just put these standoffs on the board
and then stick them to the to the inside

182
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:06,900
and then stick them to the to the inside
 

183
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,050
and then stick them to the to the inside
of the chassis so then I'm not having to

184
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,060
of the chassis so then I'm not having to
 

185
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,720
of the chassis so then I'm not having to
tap holes through aluminum and not

186
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:11,730
tap holes through aluminum and not
 

187
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,060
tap holes through aluminum and not
having to set up a permanent salute and

188
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,070
having to set up a permanent salute and
 

189
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,039
having to set up a permanent salute and
they can be kind of temporary a double

190
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:16,049
they can be kind of temporary a double
 

191
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,039
they can be kind of temporary a double
pipe as well without it I think things

192
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:19,049
pipe as well without it I think things
 

193
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:22,190
pipe as well without it I think things
up like like a double time you can put

194
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,200
up like like a double time you can put
 

195
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,120
up like like a double time you can put

they filled one one so I would stick

200
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:30,360
they filled one one so I would stick
 

201
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,840
they filled one one so I would stick
eight on a film on another side decades

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:32,850
eight on a film on another side decades
 

203
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,180
eight on a film on another side decades
and you need to put them on the back

204
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,190
and you need to put them on the back
 

205
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,460
and you need to put them on the back
because I was to take the right the ipod

206
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,470
because I was to take the right the ipod

00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,370
translators that I think he was just
 

215
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,240
translators that I think he was just
describing double tight that use the

216
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,250
describing double tight that use the
 

217
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,180
describing double tight that use the
carpet tape oh okay

218
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,190
carpet tape oh okay
 

219
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,110
carpet tape oh okay
I think you're already doing I'm gonna

220
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,120
I think you're already doing I'm gonna
 

221
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,620
I think you're already doing I'm gonna
use that

222
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:06,630
use that
 

223
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,510
use that
yeah standoffs that have the 3m

224
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,520
yeah standoffs that have the 3m
 

225
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,060
yeah standoffs that have the 3m
double-sided on it so yeah I don't want

226
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,070
double-sided on it so yeah I don't want
 

227
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,469
double-sided on it so yeah I don't want
to tape the board's themselves down

228
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
to tape the board's themselves down
 

229
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,350
to tape the board's themselves down
however I might use carpet tape for I

230
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
however I might use carpet tape for I
 

231
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,330
however I might use carpet tape for I
haven't figured out the networking yet

232
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,340
haven't figured out the networking yet
 

233
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,110
haven't figured out the networking yet
so I'm thinking I might just put a small

234
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
so I'm thinking I might just put a small
 

235
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,469
so I'm thinking I might just put a small
consumer eight port switch inside the

236
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
consumer eight port switch inside the
 

237
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,050
consumer eight port switch inside the
chassis something like that but I may

238
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,060
chassis something like that but I may
 

239
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
chassis something like that but I may
just have a bunch of ethernet cables

240
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,070
just have a bunch of ethernet cables
 

241
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,830
just have a bunch of ethernet cables
coming out the back and then tie them

242
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,840
coming out the back and then tie them
 

243
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,570
coming out the back and then tie them
all up so that it looks like one snake

244
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:32,580
all up so that it looks like one snake
 

245
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,600
all up so that it looks like one snake
coming out and then run that directly

246
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,610
coming out and then run that directly
 

247
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,550
coming out and then run that directly
into the gigabit switch on the on the

248
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,560
into the gigabit switch on the on the
 

249
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,529
into the gigabit switch on the on the
rack so I might take that approach they

250
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:39,539
rack so I might take that approach they
 

251
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,670
rack so I might take that approach they
don't gobble what do I blow these up

252
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
don't gobble what do I blow these up
 

253
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,010
don't gobble what do I blow these up
well I can remember but it's that 25

254
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,020
well I can remember but it's that 25
 

255
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,500
well I can remember but it's that 25
years ago those my man amitabh a bag

256
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:48,510
years ago those my man amitabh a bag
 

257
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,210
years ago those my man amitabh a bag
yeah yeah yeah any of that double-sided

258
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:53,220
yeah yeah yeah any of that double-sided
 

259
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,850
yeah yeah yeah any of that double-sided
tape will hold something like that into

260
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:55,860
tape will hold something like that into
 

261
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,029
tape will hold something like that into
the chassis for sure so yeah so I was

262
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
the chassis for sure so yeah so I was
 

263
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,409
the chassis for sure so yeah so I was
thinking about the power distribution

264
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:00,419
thinking about the power distribution
 

265
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,080
thinking about the power distribution
all this to say I think we've got that

266
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,090
all this to say I think we've got that
 

267
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,439
all this to say I think we've got that
figured out guys so I've got a hundred

268
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:06,449
figured out guys so I've got a hundred
 

269
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,180
figured out guys so I've got a hundred
and thirty-five watt nineteen volt

270
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,190
and thirty-five watt nineteen volt
 

271
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,020
and thirty-five watt nineteen volt
laptop power supply okay and we're gonna

272
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,030
laptop power supply okay and we're gonna
 

273
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,379
laptop power supply okay and we're gonna
step that down to five volts which if my

274
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:18,389
step that down to five volts which if my
 

275
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,149
step that down to five volts which if my
math is correct that should be is that

276
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:20,159
math is correct that should be is that
 

277
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:27,050
math is correct that should be is that
27 amps just multiply well times am

278
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,060
27 amps just multiply well times am
 

279
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,310
27 amps just multiply well times am
should be at what and do the same do the

280
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,320
should be at what and do the same do the
 

281
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,080
should be at what and do the same do the
same with the input voltage and they

282
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,090
same with the input voltage and they
 

283
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,000
same with the input voltage and they
should match yeah yeah so roughly

284
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,010
should match yeah yeah so roughly
 

285
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,170
should match yeah yeah so roughly
roughly 27 27 amps of 5 volts then and

286
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,180
roughly 27 27 amps of 5 volts then and
 

287
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,740
roughly 27 27 amps of 5 volts then and
then we're going to go into

288
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:40,750
then we're going to go into
 

289
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,360
then we're going to go into
an automotive fuse panel so you know

290
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,370
an automotive fuse panel so you know
 

291
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,090
an automotive fuse panel so you know
like that with the auto fuses it'll

292
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,100
like that with the auto fuses it'll
 

293
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,640
like that with the auto fuses it'll
it'll kind of odd looking things there's

294
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,650
it'll kind of odd looking things there's
 

295
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,860
it'll kind of odd looking things there's
a thing called a rig runner that is a

296
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:52,870
a thing called a rig runner that is a
 

297
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,320
a thing called a rig runner that is a
ham radio thing but we use that for

298
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,330
ham radio thing but we use that for
 

299
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,630
ham radio thing but we use that for
power distribution exactly the same

300
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:57,640
power distribution exactly the same
 

301
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,510
power distribution exactly the same
thing it uses automatic skew this 10 20

302
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:00,520
thing it uses automatic skew this 10 20
 

303
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,940
thing it uses automatic skew this 10 20
30 amp whatever you need right so I'm

304
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:02,950
30 amp whatever you need right so I'm
 

305
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,130
30 amp whatever you need right so I'm
going to put two amp fuses in there cuz

306
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,140
going to put two amp fuses in there cuz
 

307
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,680
going to put two amp fuses in there cuz
12 either okay they're 12 volt fuses

308
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:07,690
12 either okay they're 12 volt fuses
 

309
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,440
12 either okay they're 12 volt fuses
right so 2 amps will give me 4 point 8

310
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,450
right so 2 amps will give me 4 point 8
 

311
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,490
right so 2 amps will give me 4 point 8
volt up 4.8 amps at 5 volts you won't

312
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:14,500
volt up 4.8 amps at 5 volts you won't

you no good today I'll put my my
 

327
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,520
you no good today I'll put my my
voltmeter on there and make sure that

328
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:35,530
voltmeter on there and make sure that
 

329
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,400
voltmeter on there and make sure that
we're getting 5.0 for now I should get

330
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,410
we're getting 5.0 for now I should get
 

331
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,750
we're getting 5.0 for now I should get
them you should get the bolts you

332
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:39,760
them you should get the bolts you
 

333
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,980
them you should get the bolts you
probably just might get the looking for

334
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:42,990
probably just might get the looking for
 

335
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,530
probably just might get the looking for
some there'll be some loss yeah sure

336
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:46,540
some there'll be some loss yeah sure
 

337
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,340
some there'll be some loss yeah sure
sure

338
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,350
sure
 

339
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,170
sure
but what I'm saying is that this one

340
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,180
but what I'm saying is that this one
 

341
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,700
but what I'm saying is that this one
power supply will be able to give us

342
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:50,710
power supply will be able to give us
 

343
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,250
power supply will be able to give us
more than adequate enough of amperage to

344
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,260
more than adequate enough of amperage to
 

345
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,990
more than adequate enough of amperage to
power 8 or 10 single board computers you

346
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
power 8 or 10 single board computers you
 

347
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,920
power 8 or 10 single board computers you
consider like did I freeze yeah a little

348
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:07,930
consider like did I freeze yeah a little
 

349
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,260
consider like did I freeze yeah a little
bit

350
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,270
bit
 

351
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,050

speaking of switches I was I had there

352
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:13,060
speaking of switches I was I had there
 

353
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,640
speaking of switches I was I had there
for a few years I didn't do anything

I had a value 48 quarts switch at home

356
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:23,169
I had a value 48 quarts switch at home
 

357
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,190
I had a value 48 quarts switch at home
yeah that's one gave me was it had their

358
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,200
yeah that's one gave me was it had their
 

359
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,830
yeah that's one gave me was it had their
true content megabit ports and the rest

360
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:28,840
true content megabit ports and the rest
 

361
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:38,610
true content megabit ports and the rest
was 10 I think probably I think Robbie

362
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:38,620
was 10 I think probably I think Robbie
 

363
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,399
was 10 I think probably I think Robbie
would like that nice server and that you

to triple-a batteries so you know just
 

465
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,900
to triple-a batteries so you know just
like the model 100 and they'd run

but I don't know how to make it do that
 

517
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,500
but I don't know how to make it do that
I haven't explored that yes it's so cool

518
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,510
I haven't explored that yes it's so cool
 

519
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,700
I haven't explored that yes it's so cool
that you can do that without a green

520
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:09,710
that you can do that without a green
 

521
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,040
that you can do that without a green
screen with a zoom yeah they really need

522
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,050
screen with a zoom yeah they really need
 

523
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,270
screen with a zoom yeah they really need
to integrate that kind of technology

524
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,280
to integrate that kind of technology
 

525
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,830
to integrate that kind of technology
into Wirecast and

526
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:16,840

 

527
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,500

to UM to be able to do this somewhat on

538
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,280
to UM to be able to do this somewhat on
 

539
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,110
to UM to be able to do this somewhat on
my PC oh I'm not even on the laptop I

540
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,120
my PC oh I'm not even on the laptop I

I'm not using my work laptop for this
that's not going to happen I suspect

546
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,020
that's not going to happen I suspect
 

547
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
that's not going to happen I suspect
that it requires the computer to I don't

548
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,030
that it requires the computer to I don't
 

549

you to do that yeah oh really oh it
won't do this on the Linux client either

554
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,270
won't do this on the Linux client either

pretty unlikely Peter but III do I am
 

571
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,050
pretty unlikely Peter but III do I am
intrigued by the technology it's

572
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,060
intrigued by the technology it's
 

573
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,970
intrigued by the technology it's
unlikely that I would have time to try

574
00:14:59,970 --> 00:14:59,980
unlikely that I would have time to try
 

575
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,560
unlikely that I would have time to try
that kind of thing but Robby you'd have

576
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:04,570
that kind of thing but Robby you'd have
 

577
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,180
that kind of thing but Robby you'd have
to remember that you are actually going

578
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,190
to remember that you are actually going
 

579
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,000
to remember that you are actually going
to be on the air on AM radio frequency

580
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,010
to be on the air on AM radio frequency
 

581
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,970
to be on the air on AM radio frequency
so well that's gonna rate Oh Peter you

works and now you can have 1500 but he
 

605
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:06,019
works and now you can have 1500 but he
had a he had two amplifiers he had one

606
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:06,029

 

607
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,319

and he had to sub what's an amplifier

608
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:10,329
and he had to sub what's an amplifier
 

609
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,719
and he had to sub what's an amplifier
that he could use so he could broadcast

610
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:12,729
that he could use so he could broadcast
 

611
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:22,469
that he could use so he could broadcast
around the world the guy who was he was

00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:05,499
the funny thing is you might start with
 

641
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,909
the funny thing is you might start with
a hundred Watts and then if you go to a

642
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:08,919
a hundred Watts and then if you go to a
 

643
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:11,460
a hundred Watts and then if you go to a
thousand Watts that's only going to

644
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:11,470
thousand Watts that's only going to
 

645
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,519
thousand Watts that's only going to
increase the reception at the other end

meter it's logarithmic so then you'd

650
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:21,699
meter it's logarithmic so then you'd
 

651
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,850
meter it's logarithmic so then you'd
have to go to 10,000 watts to actually

652
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:23,860
have to go to 10,000 watts to actually
 

653
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,840
have to go to 10,000 watts to actually
get another yes so you know it's nice to

654
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:30,850
get another yes so you know it's nice to
 

655
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,879
get another yes so you know it's nice to
have the linear amplifier that it's

656
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:32,889
have the linear amplifier that it's
 

657
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:37,619
have the linear amplifier that it's
you'd that extra power but I'd rather

658
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:37,629
you'd that extra power but I'd rather
 

659
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,720
you'd that extra power but I'd rather
wait on on good conditions you have

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:39,730
wait on on good conditions you have
 

661
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,539
wait on on good conditions you have
metal like doing yeah I think and having

662
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:42,549
metal like doing yeah I think and having
 

663
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:44,760
metal like doing yeah I think and having
a 10,000 watt amplifier

664
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:44,770
a 10,000 watt amplifier
 

665
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,880

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:03,790
season the limit is somebody so I think
 

675
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:13,230

you saw one for a minute there is what
 

677
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,500
you saw one for a minute there is what
you actually can do yeah just because

678
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,510
you actually can do yeah just because
 

679
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,300
you actually can do yeah just because
you can doesn't mean you should

yeah okay yeah yeah I did I'm regulatory
things with that thing so I thought it

684
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:32,770
things with that thing so I thought it
 

685
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,250
things with that thing so I thought it
was your way back i ramble on the water

streaming day yeah yeah well that's the

722
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,270
streaming day yeah yeah well that's the
 

723
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,700
streaming day yeah yeah well that's the
thing to there's so many people that are

724
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:35,710
thing to there's so many people that are

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,060
into their work computers all of a
 

729
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
into their work computers all of a
sudden we're using 20 times the

730
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,070
sudden we're using 20 times the
 

731
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,400
sudden we're using 20 times the
bandwidth during the work day that we

732
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,410
bandwidth during the work day that we
 

733
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,270
bandwidth during the work day that we
normally would so yeah but but we've

734
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,280
normally would so yeah but but we've
 

735
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,460
normally would so yeah but but we've
already established that the service

736
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:50,470
already established that the service
 

737
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,350
already established that the service
providers are pretty much handled that

738
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,360
providers are pretty much handled that
 

739
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,030
providers are pretty much handled that
you know they can handle that kinda

740
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,040
you know they can handle that kinda
 

741
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,190
you know they can handle that kinda
thought so until this afternoon's coffee

742

problems over having a big big amplifier

764
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:43,550
problems over having a big big amplifier
 

765
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:49,540
problems over having a big big amplifier
is that the TV signals at the neighbors

766
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:49,550
is that the TV signals at the neighbors
 

767
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,750
is that the TV signals at the neighbors
when he when he was broadcasting he he

768
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
when he when he was broadcasting he he
 

769
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,390
when he when he was broadcasting he he
blocked them out so they all the signals

770
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
blocked them out so they all the signals
 

771
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,800
blocked them out so they all the signals
so every time he lived in apartment

772
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:00,810
so every time he lived in apartment
 

773
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:14,810
so every time he lived in apartment
complex so every time it comes and goes

774
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:14,820
complex so every time it comes and goes
 

775
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,090
complex so every time it comes and goes
and then he am he said that the trick

776
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,100
and then he am he said that the trick
 

777
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,130
and then he am he said that the trick
was that the antenna cable that was

778
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,140
was that the antenna cable that was
 

779
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,110
was that the antenna cable that was
going into there the TV set

780
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
going into there the TV set
 

781
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,120
going into there the TV set
he took that and wiggle it around a

782
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,130
he took that and wiggle it around a
 

783
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,530
he took that and wiggle it around a
piece of pencil and some of that

784
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:29,540
piece of pencil and some of that
 

785
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,070
piece of pencil and some of that
mitigated I thought it was actually by a

00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:05,429
like access points to their apartments
 

849
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:08,899
like access points to their apartments
and houses so now we've got such a

00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:08,909
and houses so now we've got such a
 

851
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,909

it's like saturated beyond anything that
 

857
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,960
it's like saturated beyond anything that
I've ever seen so things like why's cams

858
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:17,970
I've ever seen so things like why's cams
 

859
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,710
I've ever seen so things like why's cams
which are 2.4 gigahertz or just being

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:21,720
which are 2.4 gigahertz or just being
 

861
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,960
which are 2.4 gigahertz or just being
flushed right out so you know people are

862
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:23,970
flushed right out so you know people are
 

863
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,180
flushed right out so you know people are
starting to complain that hey my cameras

864
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,190
starting to complain that hey my cameras
 

865
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,830
starting to complain that hey my cameras
have gone offline because they've got

866
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
have gone offline because they've got
 

867
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,810
have gone offline because they've got
wireless wise cams and things like that

868
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:29,820
wireless wise cams and things like that
 

869
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,940
wireless wise cams and things like that
right but they're on the 2.4 gigahertz

870
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:31,950
right but they're on the 2.4 gigahertz
 

871
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,880
right but they're on the 2.4 gigahertz
band and somebody next door has

872
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:34,890
band and somebody next door has
 

873
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,760
band and somebody next door has
introduced two access points to their

874
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:37,770
introduced two access points to their
 

875
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,110
introduced two access points to their
network and just plug them in

876
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
network and just plug them in
 

877
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,789
network and just plug them in
willy-nilly without setting the channels

878
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
willy-nilly without setting the channels
 

879
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,010
willy-nilly without setting the channels
and stuff and all of a sudden you've

880
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,020
and stuff and all of a sudden you've
 

881
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,440
and stuff and all of a sudden you've
lost access to your network from from

882
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:45,450
lost access to your network from from
 

883
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,630
lost access to your network from from
the back of the house right even if you

884
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:47,640
the back of the house right even if you
 

885
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,580
the back of the house right even if you
wanted to sit the channels there's not

886
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:49,590
wanted to sit the channels there's not
 

887
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,430
wanted to sit the channels there's not
that many available on the 2.4 that's it

888
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,440
that many available on the 2.4 that's it
 

889
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,350
that many available on the 2.4 that's it
yeah but you've got to run a scan to

890
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,360
yeah but you've got to run a scan to
 

891
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,090
yeah but you've got to run a scan to
find out what ones are not overly

892
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,100
find out what ones are not overly
 

893
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,159
find out what ones are not overly
saturated right but it's it's constantly

894
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:58,169
saturated right but it's it's constantly
 

895
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:00,320
saturated right but it's it's constantly
evolving right now normally it like

896
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,330
evolving right now normally it like
 

897
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,000
evolving right now normally it like
maybe once a year all of a sudden you

898
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,010
maybe once a year all of a sudden you
 

899
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,080
maybe once a year all of a sudden you
got to check your channels because

900
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,090
got to check your channels because
 

901
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,669
got to check your channels because
somebody's interfering with your your

902
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:04,679
somebody's interfering with your your
 

903
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,430
somebody's interfering with your your
Wi-Fi but now it's like every week

904
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
Wi-Fi but now it's like every week
 

905
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,740
Wi-Fi but now it's like every week
you're having to figure out who's

906
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:09,750
you're having to figure out who's
 

907
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,549
you're having to figure out who's
causing interference and and fix it so

908
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
causing interference and and fix it so
 

909
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,260
causing interference and and fix it so
yeah I have not had that problem here

910
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:15,270
yeah I have not had that problem here
 

911
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,379
yeah I have not had that problem here
although 5dg and a 2.4 deep Loden

912
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:19,389
although 5dg and a 2.4 deep Loden
 

913
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:25,739
although 5dg and a 2.4 deep Loden
or router and go and I've spoke move to

914
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:25,749
or router and go and I've spoke move to
 

915
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:28,469
or router and go and I've spoke move to
5d for any devices that are capable of

916
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:28,479
5d for any devices that are capable of
 

917
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,810
5d for any devices that are capable of
doing that yeah to try and lessen the

918
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:30,820
doing that yeah to try and lessen the
 

919
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,560
doing that yeah to try and lessen the
load on the 2.4 gig but I've done this

920
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:33,570
load on the 2.4 gig but I've done this
 

921
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,209
load on the 2.4 gig but I've done this
question has you know are tied I've

922
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:36,219
question has you know are tied I've
 

923
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:38,579
question has you know are tied I've
locked down the network B time it it

924
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:38,589
locked down the network B time it it
 

925
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:41,879
locked down the network B time it it
does not transmit it some sob at all

926
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:41,889
does not transmit it some sob at all
 

927
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:43,859
does not transmit it some sob at all
range but you don't even know it's there

928
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:43,869
range but you don't even know it's there
 

929
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:46,139
range but you don't even know it's there
if you're not look if you don't know

930
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:46,149
if you're not look if you don't know
 

931
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:52,949
if you're not look if you don't know
that yes and it only allows connections

932
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:52,959
that yes and it only allows connections

00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:56,069
that yes and it only allows connections
from the MAC addresses of devices that I

934
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:56,079
from the MAC addresses of devices that I
 

935
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,459
from the MAC addresses of devices that I
know so if anybody tries to drive by and

936
00:24:59,459 --> 00:24:59,469
know so if anybody tries to drive by and
 

937
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:02,599
know so if anybody tries to drive by and
tries to connect it won't allow it

938
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:02,609
tries to connect it won't allow it
 

939
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:05,489
tries to connect it won't allow it
because it will just lock out that

940
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:05,499
because it will just lock out that
 

941
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:07,289
because it will just lock out that
Mehcad it says I don't recognize this

942
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:07,299
Mehcad it says I don't recognize this
 

943
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,180
Mehcad it says I don't recognize this
MAC address and it won't even let it

944
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,190
MAC address and it won't even let it
 

945
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,029
MAC address and it won't even let it
connect I feel good that people drive

946
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:12,039
connect I feel good that people drive
 

947
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,209
connect I feel good that people drive
because really I'm there like the only

948
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:15,219
because really I'm there like the only
 

949
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:18,119
because really I'm there like the only
way where like everybody can get a good

00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:21,009
buzz enjoy dad's on my house tried to
 

953
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:24,629
buzz enjoy dad's on my house tried to
grab my Wi-Fi so I did the same thing I

954
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:24,639
grab my Wi-Fi so I did the same thing I
 

955
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:29,549
grab my Wi-Fi so I did the same thing I
used a MAC address very smart yeah you

956
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:29,559
used a MAC address very smart yeah you
 

957
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,529
used a MAC address very smart yeah you
have to you have to because otherwise

958
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:31,539
have to you have to because otherwise
 

959
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:34,109
have to you have to because otherwise
otherwise anybody could just log in to

960
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:34,119
otherwise anybody could just log in to
 

961
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,699
otherwise anybody could just log in to
your stuff yeah and you don't

962
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:35,709
your stuff yeah and you don't
 

963
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:37,979
your stuff yeah and you don't
necessarily be doing a series I don't

964
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:37,989
necessarily be doing a series I don't
 

965
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:39,389
necessarily be doing a series I don't
know if you guys watch on the on the

966
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:39,399
know if you guys watch on the on the
 

967
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:41,399
know if you guys watch on the on the
category 5 TV website but there's a

968
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:41,409
category 5 TV website but there's a
 

969
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,829
category 5 TV website but there's a
agenda like coming shows and everything

970
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:43,839
agenda like coming shows and everything
 

971
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,930
agenda like coming shows and everything
but one of the parts of the series is

972
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:45,940
but one of the parts of the series is
 

973
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,119
but one of the parts of the series is
setting up a lockdown Wi-Fi access

974
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:48,129
setting up a lockdown Wi-Fi access
 

975
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,789
setting up a lockdown Wi-Fi access
points so that it gives access to the

976
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
points so that it gives access to the
 

977
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,579
points so that it gives access to the
the internet but not the network

978
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:53,589
the internet but not the network
 

979
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:55,499
the internet but not the network
resources so you won't be able to access

980
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:55,509
resources so you won't be able to access
 

981
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:57,569
resources so you won't be able to access
like file shares and printers and things

982
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:57,579
like file shares and printers and things
 

983
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:59,099
like file shares and printers and things
like that but you'll still be able to

984
00:25:59,099 --> 00:25:59,109
like that but you'll still be able to
 

985
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:12,449
like that but you'll still be able to
surf the web development allows

986
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:12,459

 

987
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:15,079

yeah and a network bridge that's

988
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:15,089
yeah and a network bridge that's
 

989
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:17,249
yeah and a network bridge that's
isolated from the main network as well

990
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:17,259
isolated from the main network as well
 

991
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:22,259
isolated from the main network as well
so well more modern more recent browsers

992
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:22,269
so well more modern more recent browsers
 

993
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:24,389
so well more modern more recent browsers
have a thing called guest Network which

994
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:24,399
have a thing called guest Network which
 

995
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,699
have a thing called guest Network which
have not explored yet but it would be

996
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:26,709
have not explored yet but it would be
 

997
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:29,030
have not explored yet but it would be
perfect for Internet of Things

998
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,040
perfect for Internet of Things
 

999
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,570
perfect for Internet of Things
my make any Internet of Things device

1000
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:31,580
my make any Internet of Things device
 

1001
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,150
my make any Internet of Things device
can it tree the gifts Network what that

1002
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,160
can it tree the gifts Network what that
 

1003
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,210
can it tree the gifts Network what that
means is it is a separate Wi-Fi network

1004
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,220
means is it is a separate Wi-Fi network
 

1005
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,660
means is it is a separate Wi-Fi network
from your own internal network when you

1006
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:41,670
from your own internal network when you
 

1007
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,360
from your own internal network when you
have access on the guest network that

1008
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,370
have access on the guest network that
 

1009
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,130
have access on the guest network that
device can only get to the Internet

1010
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,140
device can only get to the Internet
 

1011
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,100
device can only get to the Internet
cannot get to any of your or other

1012
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,110
cannot get to any of your or other
 

1013
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,490
cannot get to any of your or other
devices on the guest network well I'm

1014
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:52,500
devices on the guest network well I'm
 

1015
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,480
devices on the guest network well I'm
not sure about that as kind of a final

1016
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:56,490
not sure about that as kind of a final
 

1017
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,710
not sure about that as kind of a final
thought because we are at a time but

1018
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:57,720
thought because we are at a time but
 

1019
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,770
thought because we are at a time but
just in my contrast with those consumer

1020
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:00,780
just in my contrast with those consumer
 

1021
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,400
just in my contrast with those consumer
devices bp9 typically it's yes it's

1022
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,410
devices bp9 typically it's yes it's
 

1023
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,980
devices bp9 typically it's yes it's
isolated so the two networks can't

1024
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:06,990
isolated so the two networks can't
 

1025
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,640
isolated so the two networks can't
communicate with one another however

1026
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:09,650
communicate with one another however
 

1027
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,380
communicate with one another however
somebody could gain access to that guest

1028
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,390
somebody could gain access to that guest
 

1029
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,570
somebody could gain access to that guest
Wi-Fi and milk all your bandwidth for

1030
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:14,580
Wi-Fi and milk all your bandwidth for
 

1031
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,940
Wi-Fi and milk all your bandwidth for
all it's worth so I want to take it one

1032
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:16,950
all it's worth so I want to take it one
 

1033
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,740
all it's worth so I want to take it one
step further and actually limit the

1034
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:18,750
step further and actually limit the
 

1035
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,460
step further and actually limit the
amount of bandwidth that the guest

1036
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,470
amount of bandwidth that the guest
 

1037
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,460
amount of bandwidth that the guest
access can get can use so that they're

1038
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:25,470
access can get can use so that they're
 

1039
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,730
access can get can use so that they're
not using my service in such a way that

1040
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:28,740
not using my service in such a way that
 

1041
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,530
not using my service in such a way that
it's going to bog down my network I

1042
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:30,540
it's going to bog down my network I
 

1043
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,360
it's going to bog down my network I
don't want my internet to go slow

1044
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,370
don't want my internet to go slow
 

1045
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,430
don't want my internet to go slow
because the kids why kids friends have

1046
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,440
because the kids why kids friends have
 

1047
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,430
because the kids why kids friends have
their iPads yeah so I want to control

1048
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
their iPads yeah so I want to control
 

1049
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,590
their iPads yeah so I want to control
that and limit the amount of bandwidth

1050
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
that and limit the amount of bandwidth
 

1051
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,030
that and limit the amount of bandwidth
that they're allowed to use on the guest

1052
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,040
that they're allowed to use on the guest
 

1053
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:47,530
that they're allowed to use on the guest
network in addition to the isolation

1054
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:47,540

 

1055
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,860

this is the oldest access point that is

1056
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:51,870
this is the oldest access point that is
 

1057
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,460
this is the oldest access point that is
still being manufactured

1058
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:54,470
still being manufactured
 

1059
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,230
still being manufactured
you can throw any firmware on there you

1060
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,240
you can throw any firmware on there you
 

1061
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:12,910
you can throw any firmware on there you
want to throw a tomato or dd-wrt right

1062
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:12,920

 

1063
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,740

however the wrt units if I recall

1064
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:15,750
however the wrt units if I recall
 

1065
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,850
however the wrt units if I recall
correctly or 10 over 100 right am i

1066
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:19,860
correctly or 10 over 100 right am i
 

1067
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,600
correctly or 10 over 100 right am i
right in that so so that would be a

1068
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:23,610
right in that so so that would be a
 

1069
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,580
right in that so so that would be a
bottleneck on a network that's gigabit

1070
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:25,590
bottleneck on a network that's gigabit
 

1071
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,580
bottleneck on a network that's gigabit
so you wouldn't get your full speed of

1072
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:28,590
so you wouldn't get your full speed of
 

1073
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,400
so you wouldn't get your full speed of
your network yeah but for those who want

1074
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,410
your network yeah but for those who want
 

1075
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,670
your network yeah but for those who want
to limit bump it's an easy and have high

1076
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:34,680
to limit bump it's an easy and have high
 

1077
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,220
to limit bump it's an easy and have high
speed internet an easy way to limit

1078
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,230
speed internet an easy way to limit
 

1079
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,290
speed internet an easy way to limit
bandwidth is to use one of these because

1080
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:39,300
bandwidth is to use one of these because
 

1081
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,390
bandwidth is to use one of these because
they do it's not possible to get

1082
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,400
they do it's not possible to get
 

1083
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,290
they do it's not possible to get
Babbitt's that's okay yeah okay yeah I

1084
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:47,300
Babbitt's that's okay yeah okay yeah I
 

1085
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,240
Babbitt's that's okay yeah okay yeah I
see what you're saying I got you limited

1086
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,250
see what you're saying I got you limited
 

1087
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,130
see what you're saying I got you limited
