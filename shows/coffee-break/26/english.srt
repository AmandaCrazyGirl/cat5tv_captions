where's the power come in from yeah yeah

136
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:26,709
where's the power come in from yeah yeah
 

137
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,020
where's the power come in from yeah yeah
is this one is it on one of the answer

138
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,030
is this one is it on one of the answer
 

139
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,650
is this one is it on one of the answer
oh you okay right and then that

140
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:31,660
oh you okay right and then that
 

141
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,390
oh you okay right and then that
distributes power to all over rest

142
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,400
distributes power to all over rest
 

143
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,370
distributes power to all over rest
brilliant so you can do five boards with

144
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:35,380
brilliant so you can do five boards with
 

145
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,500
brilliant so you can do five boards with
that particularly absolutely yes now

146
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,510
that particularly absolutely yes now
 

147
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,170
that particularly absolutely yes now
this is the smallest unit probably out

148
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,180
this is the smallest unit probably out
 

149
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,840
this is the smallest unit probably out
of all on something you could easily you

150
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:42,850
of all on something you could easily you
 

151
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,660
of all on something you could easily you
know larger units that that can handle

152
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:45,670
know larger units that that can handle
 

153
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,699
know larger units that that can handle
more more connectors and more power

154
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:47,709
more more connectors and more power
 

155
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,930
more more connectors and more power

the one that I got has 12 terminals and

160
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:56,890
the one that I got has 12 terminals and
 

161
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,500
the one that I got has 12 terminals and
they are screw terminal so you'll use

162
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:58,510
they are screw terminal so you'll use
 

163
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,229
they are screw terminal so you'll use
like like the I don't know what you call

164
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:01,239
like like the I don't know what you call
 

165

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,120
input right yes that's correct
 

315
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:46,060
input right yes that's correct
yes but that's 48 whoops can't take me

316
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,070
yes but that's 48 whoops can't take me
 

317
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,930
yes but that's 48 whoops can't take me
anywhere I'll tell you what let me do

318
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:49,940
anywhere I'll tell you what let me do
 

319
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,040
anywhere I'll tell you what let me do
this again yeah okay so that

320
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,050
this again yeah okay so that
 

321
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,500
this again yeah okay so that
the input here is 40 Empire at 12 volts

322
00:08:59,500 --> 00:08:59,510
the input here is 40 Empire at 12 volts
 

323
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,230
the input here is 40 Empire at 12 volts
okay that power the team put here is

324
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
okay that power the team put here is
 

325
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,960
okay that power the team put here is
distributed to all the RS in this class

326
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:04,970
distributed to all the RS in this class
 

327
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,360
distributed to all the RS in this class
yes sir so here's my theory bad thank

328
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,370
yes sir so here's my theory bad thank
 

329
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,269
yes sir so here's my theory bad thank
you that would work does that 40 amp

330
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:10,279
you that would work does that 40 amp
 

331
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,610
you that would work does that 40 amp
work as a pseudo surge suppressor so if

332
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:12,620
work as a pseudo surge suppressor so if
 

333
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,000
work as a pseudo surge suppressor so if
you suddenly got a snake no it's a fuse

334
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,010
you suddenly got a snake no it's a fuse
 

335
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,190
you suddenly got a snake no it's a fuse
that's all it is just it's an automotive

336
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,200
that's all it is just it's an automotive
 

337
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,650
that's all it is just it's an automotive
fuse just like it would die right it

338
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:20,660
fuse just like it would die right it
 

339
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,000
fuse just like it would die right it
would like cut off the power to the

340
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,010
would like cut off the power to the
 

341
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,620
would like cut off the power to the
boards if it exceeded 40 amps oh yeah

342
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:26,630
boards if it exceeded 40 amps oh yeah
 

343
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,750
boards if it exceeded 40 amps oh yeah
but you'd have to draw more than 40 amps

344
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:28,760
but you'd have to draw more than 40 amps
 

345
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,230
but you'd have to draw more than 40 amps
through through the connectors for okay

346
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
through through the connectors for okay
 

347
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,600
through through the connectors for okay
I'm learning and learning but more

348
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,610
I'm learning and learning but more
 

349
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm learning and learning but more
likely one of the lower amperage fuses

350
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:40,610
likely one of the lower amperage fuses
 

351
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,519
likely one of the lower amperage fuses
would blow before the 40 amp point does

352
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:42,529
would blow before the 40 amp point does
 

353
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,130
would blow before the 40 amp point does
okay after that we have to pull a total

354
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:45,140
okay after that we have to pull a total
 

355
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,970
okay after that we have to pull a total
load I mean there's 225 amp fuses right

356
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:48,980
load I mean there's 225 amp fuses right
 

357
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,430
load I mean there's 225 amp fuses right
so theoretically you could try to pull

358
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
so theoretically you could try to pull
 

359
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,370
so theoretically you could try to pull
25 amps from each of these connectors

360
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:54,380
25 amps from each of these connectors
 

361
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,889
25 amps from each of these connectors
mmm that would be 50 amps that would

362
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:56,899
mmm that would be 50 amps that would
 

363
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,420
mmm that would be 50 amps that would
blow these fuses might hold on but would

364
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:01,430
blow these fuses might hold on but would
 

365
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,160
blow these fuses might hold on but would
certainly so does that does that protect

366
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,170
certainly so does that does that protect
 

367
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,430
certainly so does that does that protect
your mains from tripping that the idea

368
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:06,440
your mains from tripping that the idea
 

369
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,410
your mains from tripping that the idea
yeah well you're feeding this you're

370
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:08,420
yeah well you're feeding this you're
 

371
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,019
yeah well you're feeding this you're
feeding this from a 12 volt source the

372
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:11,029
feeding this from a 12 volt source the
 

373
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,630
feeding this from a 12 volt source the
car got at least four not one okay right

374
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:13,640
car got at least four not one okay right
 

375
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,920
car got at least four not one okay right
right you're not pulling this from mine

376
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:14,930
right you're not pulling this from mine
 

377
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,130
right you're not pulling this from mine
doesn't like an arc welder but well yeah

378
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,140
doesn't like an arc welder but well yeah
 

379
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,829
doesn't like an arc welder but well yeah
but that would be well you're thinking

380
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:20,839
but that would be well you're thinking
 

381
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,300
but that would be well you're thinking
agamotto you're thinking 40 amps at 110

382
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,310
agamotto you're thinking 40 amps at 110
 

383
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,880
agamotto you're thinking 40 amps at 110
volts right yeah right this is 12 volt

384
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:27,890
volts right yeah right this is 12 volt
 

385
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,300
volts right yeah right this is 12 volt
this is 12 volts so you're not going to

386
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,310
this is 12 volts so you're not going to
 

387
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,940
this is 12 volts so you're not going to
be running knock welder from this making

388
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:33,950
be running knock welder from this making
 

389
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,750
be running knock welder from this making
me having to do math in my head

390
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760

 

391
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,990

1.2 amps at 120 volts yes something like

392
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
1.2 amps at 120 volts yes something like
 

393
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,439
1.2 amps at 120 volts yes something like
that

394
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:44,449
that
 

395
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:52,780
that
okay so yeah here's some more geekery

396
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:52,790
okay so yeah here's some more geekery
 

397
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,610
okay so yeah here's some more geekery
for you Robbie the pine time yeah so I

398
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:57,620
for you Robbie the pine time yeah so I
 

399
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,430
for you Robbie the pine time yeah so I
was messing around with my program that

400
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:00,440
was messing around with my program that
 

401
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,090
was messing around with my program that
that wrote that that drew that watch

402
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,100
that wrote that that drew that watch
 

403
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,340
that wrote that that drew that watch
face because I was trying to figure out

404
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,350
face because I was trying to figure out
 

405
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,440
face because I was trying to figure out
I think I've talked

406
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,450
I think I've talked
 

407
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,570
I think I've talked
that this before and stop me if I have I

408
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:10,580
that this before and stop me if I have I
 

409
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,340
that this before and stop me if I have I
will be happy to talk about something

410
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,350
will be happy to talk about something
 

411
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,520
will be happy to talk about something
else but I was mentioning that the

412
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,530
else but I was mentioning that the
 

413
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,150
else but I was mentioning that the
minute hand and the second hand I would

414
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,160
minute hand and the second hand I would
 

415
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,400
minute hand and the second hand I would
be okay with it jumping one second to

416
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,410
be okay with it jumping one second to
 

417
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,910
be okay with it jumping one second to
the next second okay make sense cut but

418
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:24,920
the next second okay make sense cut but
 

419
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,900
the next second okay make sense cut but
I can't do that with the hour hand right

420
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:27,910
I can't do that with the hour hand right
 

421
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,390
I can't do that with the hour hand right
hand has to move more incrementally than

422
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:31,400
hand has to move more incrementally than
 

423
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,100
hand has to move more incrementally than
that it would it would look pretty

424
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,110
that it would it would look pretty
 

425
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,830
that it would it would look pretty
jarring at the hour hand jump from one

426
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:35,840
jarring at the hour hand jump from one
 

427
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,180
jarring at the hour hand jump from one
minute to the next

428
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,190
minute to the next
 

429
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,700
minute to the next
might only that I think I would have

430
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:39,710
might only that I think I would have
 

431
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,390
might only that I think I would have
trouble reading the time if it was like

432
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:42,400
trouble reading the time if it was like
 

433
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,520
trouble reading the time if it was like
11:58 and our hand was pointed at 1100

434
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:48,530
11:58 and our hand was pointed at 1100
 

435
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,690
11:58 and our hand was pointed at 1100
yeah exactly

436
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:49,700
yeah exactly
 

437
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,300
yeah exactly
yes precisely yeah so the yeah my hand

438
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,310
yes precisely yeah so the yeah my hand
 

439
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,820
yes precisely yeah so the yeah my hand
has to move at least every minute and

440
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:54,830
has to move at least every minute and
 

441
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,250
has to move at least every minute and
probably more incrementally than that so

442
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,260
probably more incrementally than that so
 

443
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,890
probably more incrementally than that so
I ran the so I ran a program to figure

444
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:02,900
I ran the so I ran a program to figure
 

445
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,680
I ran the so I ran a program to figure
out what the XY coordinates would be for

446
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:05,690
out what the XY coordinates would be for
 

447
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,980
out what the XY coordinates would be for
each of the locations the from the

448
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:08,990
each of the locations the from the
 

449
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,560
each of the locations the from the
center to where the our hand would be

450
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:11,570
center to where the our hand would be
 

451
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,930
center to where the our hand would be
right so because if the our hand moves

452
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:13,940
right so because if the our hand moves
 

453
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,930
right so because if the our hand moves
around I've said for 360 degrees which

454
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:16,940
around I've said for 360 degrees which
 

455
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,730
around I've said for 360 degrees which
is what you know Peter and I talked

456
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:18,740
is what you know Peter and I talked
 

457
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,060
is what you know Peter and I talked
about for 360 degrees figure out what

458
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,070
about for 360 degrees figure out what
 

459
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,070
about for 360 degrees figure out what
with the XY coordinates were and they

460
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,080
with the XY coordinates were and they
 

461
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,800
with the XY coordinates were and they
weren't making any sense and so it turns

462
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:26,810
weren't making any sense and so it turns
 

463
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,700
weren't making any sense and so it turns
out at least on gtk which is the UI

464
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:30,710
out at least on gtk which is the UI
 

465
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,790
out at least on gtk which is the UI
toolkit that I'm using to best thing the

466
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
toolkit that I'm using to best thing the
 

467
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,060
toolkit that I'm using to best thing the
12 o'clock position is directly out to

468
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,070
12 o'clock position is directly out to
 

469
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,520
12 o'clock position is directly out to
the right it is it's like it's at the

470
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:42,530
the right it is it's like it's at the
 

471
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:49,650
the right it is it's like it's at the
three o'clock position so if I only draw

472
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:49,660

 

473
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,210

draw the twelve o'clock at the three

474
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:52,220
draw the twelve o'clock at the three
 

475
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,670
draw the twelve o'clock at the three
o'clock position and then it would draw

476
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:54,680
o'clock position and then it would draw
 

477
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,780
o'clock position and then it would draw
five more minutes

478
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:55,790
five more minutes
 

479
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,180
five more minutes
counting down this way yeah so the whole

480
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,190
counting down this way yeah so the whole
 

481
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,250
counting down this way yeah so the whole
clock face is turned 90 degrees so I've

482
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,260
clock face is turned 90 degrees so I've
 

483
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:06,220
clock face is turned 90 degrees so I've
got a yeah just a bit messed up that I

484
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,230
got a yeah just a bit messed up that I
 

485
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,170
got a yeah just a bit messed up that I
think that's accident and literally just

486
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:08,180
think that's accident and literally just
 

487
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,360
think that's accident and literally just
an orientation issue on the on that were

488
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,370
an orientation issue on the on that were
 

489
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,270
an orientation issue on the on that were
a workspace now I'm gonna have to figure

490
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,280
a workspace now I'm gonna have to figure
 

491
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,270
a workspace now I'm gonna have to figure
out how to how to translate around 90

492
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,280
out how to how to translate around 90
 

493
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,580
out how to how to translate around 90
degrees so the watch face is the correct

494
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,590
degrees so the watch face is the correct
 

495
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,879
degrees so the watch face is the correct
area

496
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:21,889
area
 

497
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:24,099
area
you have to start eating your watch like

498
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:24,109
you have to start eating your watch like
 

499
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:36,699
you have to start eating your watch like
this well I could just swap the x and

500
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:36,709
this well I could just swap the x and
 

501
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,400
this well I could just swap the x and
y-axes right

502
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,410

 

503
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,650

that might work I'm afraid it'll go into

504
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:41,660
that might work I'm afraid it'll go into
 

505
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,409
that might work I'm afraid it'll go into
the negatives if I do that I'll think

506
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:44,419
the negatives if I do that I'll think
 

507
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:51,939
the negatives if I do that I'll think
about I'll have to think about that well

508
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:51,949
about I'll have to think about that well
 

509
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:53,769
about I'll have to think about that well
just draw it that way well maybe not

510
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:53,779
just draw it that way well maybe not
 

511
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,780
just draw it that way well maybe not
grainy numbers and let you figure out

512
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:55,790
grainy numbers and let you figure out
 

513
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:13,389
grainy numbers and let you figure out
what the time yeah look there are all

514
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:13,399
what the time yeah look there are all
 

515
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,069
what the time yeah look there are all
kinds of solutions I literally found

516
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:15,079
kinds of solutions I literally found
 

517
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:16,780
kinds of solutions I literally found
this at like I live in a clock last

518
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:16,790
this at like I live in a clock last
 

519
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,909
this at like I live in a clock last
night and that was the point that I said

520
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:18,919
night and that was the point that I said
 

521
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:25,929
night and that was the point that I said
I'm done I'm going home what's it you

and get started on some of the
construction work so that leavings like

570
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:45,200
construction work so that leavings like
 

571
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,000
construction work so that leavings like
close this your permits yeah well we

572
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,010
close this your permits yeah well we
 

573

don't need permits because it's not
 

575
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,900
don't need permits because it's not
non-structural it's just strictly like

576
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:52,910
non-structural it's just strictly like
 

577
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,090
non-structural it's just strictly like
they're building things like the stage

578
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,100
they're building things like the stage
 

579
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,020
they're building things like the stage
and the conduit and trust that's going

580
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,030
and the conduit and trust that's going
 

581
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,700
and the conduit and trust that's going
to be mounted to the drop ceiling for

582
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:00,710
to be mounted to the drop ceiling for
 

583
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,050
to be mounted to the drop ceiling for
the lighting all that kind of stuff has

584
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,060
the lighting all that kind of stuff has
 

585
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,310
the lighting all that kind of stuff has
to be built oh it's a framing okay no no

586
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
to be built oh it's a framing okay no no
 

587
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,350
to be built oh it's a framing okay no no
that's all done luckily we had that done

588
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,360
that's all done luckily we had that done
 

589
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,880
that's all done luckily we had that done
ahead of time so it's painted in

590
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:09,890
ahead of time so it's painted in
 

591
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,910
ahead of time so it's painted in
everything but we had to halt like they

592
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:12,920
everything but we had to halt like they
 

593
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,530
everything but we had to halt like they
can't go in and build the stage for

594
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:14,540
can't go in and build the stage for
 

595
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,200
can't go in and build the stage for
example which is you know that's kind of

596
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,210
example which is you know that's kind of
 

597
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,720
example which is you know that's kind of
a bummer considering we're live in a in

598
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:19,730
a bummer considering we're live in a in
 

599
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,740
a bummer considering we're live in a in
a week but but what we can do now where

600
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:23,750
a week but but what we can do now where
 

601
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,870
a week but but what we can do now where
we had previously had to halt everything

602
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:25,880
we had previously had to halt everything
 

603
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,080
we had previously had to halt everything
he will be able to come in and do things

604
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,090
he will be able to come in and do things
 

605
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,080
he will be able to come in and do things
like perhaps building the truss

606
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,090
like perhaps building the truss
 

607
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,570
like perhaps building the truss
perhaps putting up the backdrops on the

608
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:34,580
perhaps putting up the backdrops on the
 

609
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,640
perhaps putting up the backdrops on the
wall those kinds of things stuff that is

610
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,650
wall those kinds of things stuff that is
 

611
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,130
wall those kinds of things stuff that is
not going to be considered construction

612
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,140
not going to be considered construction
 

613
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,710
not going to be considered construction
but still needs to be done so he won't

614
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:41,720
but still needs to be done so he won't
 

615
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,240
but still needs to be done so he won't
be able to build the stage for example

616
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,250
be able to build the stage for example
 

617
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,670
be able to build the stage for example
but he'll be able to do some of the some

618
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
but he'll be able to do some of the some
 

619
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,960
but he'll be able to do some of the some
of the fixtures and things like that

620
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:46,970
of the fixtures and things like that
 

621
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,660
of the fixtures and things like that
maybe there's an electrical wiring you

622
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:49,670
maybe there's an electrical wiring you
 

623
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,580
maybe there's an electrical wiring you
have you drilled any holes through any

624
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:51,590
have you drilled any holes through any
 

625
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,590
have you drilled any holes through any
load-bearing studs yet I mean through

626
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
load-bearing studs yet I mean through
 

627
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,830
load-bearing studs yet I mean through
the wall yeah our server rack you see

628
00:16:59,830 --> 00:16:59,840
the wall yeah our server rack you see
 

629
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,050
the wall yeah our server rack you see
that cutaway you see the cutaway in the

630
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,060
that cutaway you see the cutaway in the
 

631
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,480
that cutaway you see the cutaway in the
studio for the server rack yeah turns

632
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,490
studio for the server rack yeah turns
 

633
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,510
studio for the server rack yeah turns
out that is because those are

634
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:06,520
out that is because those are
 

635
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,699
out that is because those are
load-bearing block walls that's why it's

636
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:09,709
load-bearing block walls that's why it's
 

637
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,329
load-bearing block walls that's why it's
there oh yeah so so I don't know if you

638
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:13,339
there oh yeah so so I don't know if you
 

639
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,790
there oh yeah so so I don't know if you
ever noticed but the coax for the

640
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:15,800
ever noticed but the coax for the
 

641
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,559
ever noticed but the coax for the
Internet actually hangs down from the

642
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:17,569
Internet actually hangs down from the
 

643
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,750
Internet actually hangs down from the
ceiling in there because we can't pull

644
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
ceiling in there because we can't pull
 

645
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,309
ceiling in there because we can't pull
it in through the wall so it's actually

646
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:21,319
it in through the wall so it's actually
 

647
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,429
it in through the wall so it's actually
hanging down so the the Installer had to

648
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:24,439
hanging down so the the Installer had to
 

649
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,830
hanging down so the the Installer had to
find a break in the bricks above and the

650
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
find a break in the bricks above and the
 

651
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,900
find a break in the bricks above and the
pub feed his fish down yeah punch a hole

652
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:31,910
pub feed his fish down yeah punch a hole
 

653
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,450
pub feed his fish down yeah punch a hole
through the roof so it's basically

654
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:34,460
through the roof so it's basically
 

655
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,290
through the roof so it's basically
feeding in between two blocks our coax

656
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,300
feeding in between two blocks our coax
 

657
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,090
feeding in between two blocks our coax
so we won't be able to a lot of wiring

658
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,100
so we won't be able to a lot of wiring
 

659
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,970
so we won't be able to a lot of wiring
in there it's okay to duck blew in there

660
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:42,980
in there it's okay to duck blew in there
 

661
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,800
in there it's okay to duck blew in there
so it's very hard to see any detail

662
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:44,810
so it's very hard to see any detail
 

663
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,580
so it's very hard to see any detail
through yeah

664
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:47,590
through yeah
 

665
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,310
through yeah
yeah yeah I thought I put some LEDs in

666
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,320
yeah yeah I thought I put some LEDs in
 

667
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,140
yeah yeah I thought I put some LEDs in
there make it look nice as well so of

668
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,150
there make it look nice as well so of
 

669
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,000
there make it look nice as well so of
course oh cool and then that reminds me

670
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,010
course oh cool and then that reminds me
 

671
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,560
course oh cool and then that reminds me
of the whole craziness with Amazon

672
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:56,570
of the whole craziness with Amazon
 

673
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,930
of the whole craziness with Amazon
shipping it's like our water cooler I

674
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:58,940
shipping it's like our water cooler I
 

675
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,640
shipping it's like our water cooler I
ordered it this is the water dispenser

676
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,650
ordered it this is the water dispenser
 

677
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,810
ordered it this is the water dispenser
because we don't have any running water

678
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:01,820
because we don't have any running water
 

679

the for the the single board computers

684
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:12,470
the for the the single board computers
 

685
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,160
the for the the single board computers
that arrived today so along with the

686
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,170
that arrived today so along with the
 

687
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,780
that arrived today so along with the
fuse panel in the fuses and everything

688
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:16,790
fuse panel in the fuses and everything
 

689
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,480
fuse panel in the fuses and everything
else so so it looks like things are

690
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,490
else so so it looks like things are
 

691
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,180
else so so it looks like things are
gonna move forward quicker now that you

692
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,190
gonna move forward quicker now that you
 

693
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,740
gonna move forward quicker now that you
know I guess people are getting into the

694
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:23,750
know I guess people are getting into the
 

695
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,970
know I guess people are getting into the
new routine I think things are gonna

696
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:24,980
new routine I think things are gonna
 

697
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,070
new routine I think things are gonna
start pushing along but I sent an email

698
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,080
start pushing along but I sent an email
 

699
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,600
start pushing along but I sent an email
to the contractor and I'm hoping he'll

700
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:28,610
to the contractor and I'm hoping he'll
 

701
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,430
to the contractor and I'm hoping he'll
get back to me and say yes let's do this

702
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:30,440
get back to me and say yes let's do this
 

703
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,500
get back to me and say yes let's do this
and then we can have things like that

704
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:32,510
and then we can have things like that
 

705
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,390
and then we can have things like that
mainly the backdrop on the wall and

706
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
mainly the backdrop on the wall and
 

707
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,410
mainly the backdrop on the wall and
stuff like that I'm not going to be

708
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:35,420
stuff like that I'm not going to be
 

709
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,570
stuff like that I'm not going to be
hanging anything myself I want it done

710
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:37,580
hanging anything myself I want it done
 

711
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,940
hanging anything myself I want it done
properly and I don't want shelves at a

712
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:39,950
properly and I don't want shelves at a
 

713
00:18:39,950 --> 00:19:01,210
properly and I don't want shelves at a
45 degree angle so I think I just don't

714
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,220
45 degree angle so I think I just don't
 

715
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,620
45 degree angle so I think I just don't
like it at all I told I told the

716
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,630
like it at all I told I told the
 

717

remember studio studio c2 studio D it

730
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,040
remember studio studio c2 studio D it
 

731
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,530
remember studio studio c2 studio D it
was a nightmare I had to do all that

732
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:23,540
was a nightmare I had to do all that
 

733
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,080
was a nightmare I had to do all that
work and and our team had to like rip

734
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,090
work and and our team had to like rip
 

735
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,240
work and and our team had to like rip
the place apart I was watching some of

736
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,250
the place apart I was watching some of
 

737
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,880
the place apart I was watching some of
those old videos of the move into studio

738
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:30,890
those old videos of the move into studio
 

739
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,400
those old videos of the move into studio
D and how it took four months to

740
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,410
D and how it took four months to
 

741
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,580
D and how it took four months to
renovate it and it was a brutal it was

742
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:36,590
renovate it and it was a brutal it was
 

743
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,880
renovate it and it was a brutal it was
brutal so moving into a place and being

744
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:39,890
brutal so moving into a place and being
 

745
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,400
brutal so moving into a place and being
able to say okay you do everything it's

746
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,410
able to say okay you do everything it's
 

747
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,740
able to say okay you do everything it's
a really good feeling so I'm just doing

748
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:47,750
a really good feeling so I'm just doing
 

749
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,800
a really good feeling so I'm just doing
all the wiring that's all but I will be

750
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:50,810
all the wiring that's all but I will be
 

751
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,950
all the wiring that's all but I will be
drilling holes tonight and Kickstarter

752
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:53,960
drilling holes tonight and Kickstarter
 

753
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,280
drilling holes tonight and Kickstarter
Kickstarter viewers will see that on the

754
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,290
Kickstarter viewers will see that on the
 

755
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,130
Kickstarter viewers will see that on the
flog because I need to get the cables

756
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,140
flog because I need to get the cables
 

757
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,850

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,080
cameras I have to get them from the
 

761
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,310
cameras I have to get them from the
studio into the producers office so I do

762
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
studio into the producers office so I do
 

763
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,750
studio into the producers office so I do
have to put a couple of two-inch holes

764
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
have to put a couple of two-inch holes
 

765
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,970
have to put a couple of two-inch holes
in the wall and I'll just put them off

766
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:09,980
in the wall and I'll just put them off
 

767
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,380
in the wall and I'll just put them off
to the side so that he can build around

and then I'm gonna cut off like a 12

778
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:25,970
and then I'm gonna cut off like a 12
 

779
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,840
and then I'm gonna cut off like a 12
inch piece of PVC to put in it so that

780
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:28,850
inch piece of PVC to put in it so that
 

781
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,660
inch piece of PVC to put in it so that
I'm not putting the the cables on cut

782
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:31,670
I'm not putting the the cables on cut
 

783
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:41,140
I'm not putting the the cables on cut
drywall took out the power in in baby

784
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,150
drywall took out the power in in baby
 

785
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:51,100
drywall took out the power in in baby
because it oh and so we just called it a

786
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,110
because it oh and so we just called it a
 

787
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,110
because it oh and so we just called it a
hole in the wall yeah

788
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120

 

789
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,210

but I'm thinking your contractor if he

790
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,220
but I'm thinking your contractor if he
 

791
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,700
but I'm thinking your contractor if he
if he squeezed the hallway out he could

792
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:00,710
if he squeezed the hallway out he could
 

793
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,740
if he squeezed the hallway out he could
make a nice wooden you know like a

794
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:02,750
make a nice wooden you know like a
 

795
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,700
make a nice wooden you know like a
window frame I surround it oh and what

796
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:06,710
window frame I surround it oh and what
 

797
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,260
window frame I surround it oh and what
he's going to do is he's actually going

798
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,270
he's going to do is he's actually going
 

799
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,650
he's going to do is he's actually going
he's going to build a conduit that goes

800
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:11,660
he's going to build a conduit that goes
 

801
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,560
he's going to build a conduit that goes
from the studio from the producers

802
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:14,570
from the studio from the producers
 

803
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,530
from the studio from the producers
office into the stage it's actually

804
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:17,540
office into the stage it's actually
 

805
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,140
office into the stage it's actually
gonna go to the stage so all the cabling

806
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,150
gonna go to the stage so all the cabling
 

807
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,549
gonna go to the stage so all the cabling
is going to be completely hidden along

808
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:21,559
is going to be completely hidden along
 

809
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,460
is going to be completely hidden along
the baseboard at the side of the studio

810
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,470
the baseboard at the side of the studio
 

811
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,470
the baseboard at the side of the studio
and then it's going to come out

812
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
and then it's going to come out
 

813
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,810
and then it's going to come out
underneath the stage so any wiring we

814
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:28,820
underneath the stage so any wiring we
 

815
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,970
underneath the stage so any wiring we
need to do we'll just lift the stage up

816
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:30,980
need to do we'll just lift the stage up
 

817
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,409
need to do we'll just lift the stage up
and do it under there and then put the

818
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:32,419
and do it under there and then put the
 

819
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:34,180
and do it under there and then put the
stage back down and it's it's all

820
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,190
stage back down and it's it's all
 

821
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,549
stage back down and it's it's all
completely hidden so all our cameras

822
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
completely hidden so all our cameras
 

823
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,580
completely hidden so all our cameras
yeah we're gonna have Keystone jacks for

824
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:39,590
yeah we're gonna have Keystone jacks for
 

825
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,860
yeah we're gonna have Keystone jacks for
the cameras at the front of the stage so

826
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:41,870
the cameras at the front of the stage so
 

827
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,690
the cameras at the front of the stage so
we can plug in the cameras directly to

828
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:43,700
we can plug in the cameras directly to
 

829
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,060
we can plug in the cameras directly to
that we don't have to run cables across

830
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,070
that we don't have to run cables across
 

831
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,860
that we don't have to run cables across
the floor and all that kind of stuff

832
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:47,870
the floor and all that kind of stuff
 

833
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,289
the floor and all that kind of stuff
bill you remember what all the cables

834
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:50,299
bill you remember what all the cables
 

835
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:56,740
bill you remember what all the cables
across the floor we're like so has an

836
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:56,750
across the floor we're like so has an
 

837
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:02,430
across the floor we're like so has an
impression of that too you mentioned

838
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:02,440
impression of that too you mentioned
 

839
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,360
impression of that too you mentioned
keystone panel before

840
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,370
keystone panel before
 

841
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,970
keystone panel before
what's a keystone jack is that one of

842
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:06,980
what's a keystone jack is that one of
 

843
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,040
what's a keystone jack is that one of
those big four connect the jacks at the

844
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,050
those big four connect the jacks at the
 

845
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,299
those big four connect the jacks at the
camera uses or is LPM Keystone is is

846
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:13,309
camera uses or is LPM Keystone is is
 

847
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:14,779
camera uses or is LPM Keystone is is
like a module

848
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:14,789
like a module
 

849
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:19,440
like a module
I'm standard I suppose okay so so you

850
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,450
I'm standard I suppose okay so so you
 

851
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,440
I'm standard I suppose okay so so you
can buy a like a faceplate that will

852
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,450
can buy a like a faceplate that will
 

853
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,690
can buy a like a faceplate that will
have to Keystone holes or for Keystone

854
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:24,700
have to Keystone holes or for Keystone
 

855
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,210
have to Keystone holes or for Keystone
holes or six Keystone holes and then you

856
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:27,220
holes or six Keystone holes and then you
 

857
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,980
holes or six Keystone holes and then you
choose what you want the jack to be so

858
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,990
choose what you want the jack to be so
 

859
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,869
choose what you want the jack to be so
it could be a keystone Ethernet it could

860
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:30,879
it could be a keystone Ethernet it could
 

861
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:33,869
it could be a keystone Ethernet it could
be a keystone HDMI or Keystone banana

862
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:33,879
be a keystone HDMI or Keystone banana
 

863
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,340
be a keystone HDMI or Keystone banana
plug or whatever and then you just snap

864
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:35,350
plug or whatever and then you just snap
 

865
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,499
plug or whatever and then you just snap
that in and now on the faceplate from

866
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:37,509
that in and now on the faceplate from
 

867
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:40,889
that in and now on the faceplate from
aaja HDMI yeah it's a module so you've

868
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:40,899
aaja HDMI yeah it's a module so you've
 

869
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:44,879
aaja HDMI yeah it's a module so you've
got HDMI Ethernet audio you can have all

870
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:44,889
got HDMI Ethernet audio you can have all
 

871
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:46,680
got HDMI Ethernet audio you can have all
that on the on the keystone panel so

872
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:46,690
that on the on the keystone panel so
 

873
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,169
that on the on the keystone panel so
okay okay I think that we could as part

874
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:52,179
okay okay I think that we could as part
 

875
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:55,560
okay okay I think that we could as part
of the construction said is mounted

876
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:55,570
of the construction said is mounted
 

877
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,330
of the construction said is mounted
camera somewhere that takes a picture

878
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,340
camera somewhere that takes a picture
 

879
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,580
camera somewhere that takes a picture
every 12 seconds and then you can add

880
00:22:59,580 --> 00:22:59,590
every 12 seconds and then you can add
 

881
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:06,210
every 12 seconds and then you can add
your a small to minute short fast and

882
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:06,220
your a small to minute short fast and
 

883
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,970
your a small to minute short fast and
see see see the states being built in

884
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:08,980
see see see the states being built in
 

885
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:19,109
see see see the states being built in
just a minute so we have wise cam setup

886
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:19,119
just a minute so we have wise cam setup
 

887

at Studio D when and this whole thing

902
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:09,429
at Studio D when and this whole thing
 

903
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,909
at Studio D when and this whole thing
went down so I set it up for 10 second

904
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
went down so I set it up for 10 second
 

905
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,609
went down so I set it up for 10 second
time lapse and it's been shooting so it

906
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:14,619
time lapse and it's been shooting so it
 

907
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,549
time lapse and it's been shooting so it
shot the entire process of folding up

908
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:17,559
shot the entire process of folding up
 

909
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,749
shot the entire process of folding up
studio D and it is now shooting the main

we'll be part of the Kickstarter vlog
 

917
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,239
we'll be part of the Kickstarter vlog
when this is all done and it will indeed

918
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:33,249
when this is all done and it will indeed
 

919
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:36,840
when this is all done and it will indeed
be a hyperlapse of the of the build

920
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:36,850
be a hyperlapse of the of the build
 

921
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,879
be a hyperlapse of the of the build
process but it starts with the teardown

922
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:38,889
process but it starts with the teardown
 

923
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:40,769
process but it starts with the teardown
of Studio B and we already have all that
