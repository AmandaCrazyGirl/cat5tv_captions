something like that maker verse Wow so

482
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,290
something like that maker verse Wow so
 

483
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,020
something like that maker verse Wow so
you have to have a 3d printer but that's

484
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,030
you have to have a 3d printer but that's
 

485
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,130

here yeah that's what I I'd love that to
 

495
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,220
here yeah that's what I I'd love that to
stick that in a in my rack at the at the

studio yeah although I do like that I'm

498
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:03,500
studio yeah although I do like that I'm
 

499
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,380
studio yeah although I do like that I'm
able to yeah I do like though I mean cuz

500
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,390
able to yeah I do like though I mean cuz
 

501
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,050
able to yeah I do like though I mean cuz
Raspberry Pi to me like having used so

502
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,060
Raspberry Pi to me like having used so
 

503
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,340
Raspberry Pi to me like having used so
many different single board computers

504
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,350
many different single board computers
 

505
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,400
many different single board computers
Raspberry Pi is like the least I guess

506
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,410
Raspberry Pi is like the least I guess
 

507
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,980
Raspberry Pi is like the least I guess
as far as like reliability goes so I'd

508
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:17,990
as far as like reliability goes so I'd
 

509
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,170
as far as like reliability goes so I'd
rather have like an xu 4 so if i could

510
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:20,180
rather have like an xu 4 so if i could
 

511
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,880
rather have like an xu 4 so if i could
have something like that with some xu

512
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:21,890
have something like that with some xu
 

513
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,690
have something like that with some xu
fours in it that would be amazing

514
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:24,700
fours in it that would be amazing
 

515
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,300
fours in it that would be amazing
well given how you were UN both have

516
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,310
well given how you were UN both have
 

517
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,420
well given how you were UN both have
talked about how raspberry PI's can

518
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,430
talked about how raspberry PI's can
 

519
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,590
talked about how raspberry PI's can
corrupt the SD card when the power drops

520
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,600
corrupt the SD card when the power drops
 

521
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
corrupt the SD card when the power drops
suddenly or it was you and masked man I

522
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,610
suddenly or it was you and masked man I
 

523
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,100
suddenly or it was you and masked man I
think it I think it was masked man who

524
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,110
think it I think it was masked man who
 

525

Peters yeah I may have to go get me like

530
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:47,500
Peters yeah I may have to go get me like
 

531
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,710
Peters yeah I may have to go get me like
a no droid or two or something like that

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:49,720
a no droid or two or something like that
 

533
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,590
a no droid or two or something like that
- yeah I'd start letting Odroid xu4 I

534
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:52,600
- yeah I'd start letting Odroid xu4 I
 

535
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,710
- yeah I'd start letting Odroid xu4 I
think Odroid XP or is the real like one

536
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:55,720
think Odroid XP or is the real like one
 

537
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,260
think Odroid XP or is the real like one
to one like comparable to maybe a PI 3 b

538
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,270
to one like comparable to maybe a PI 3 b
 

539
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,060
to one like comparable to maybe a PI 3 b
plus but a little bit more power than

540
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,070
plus but a little bit more power than
 

541
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,460
plus but a little bit more power than
that plus it's going to two gigs of ram

542
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,470
that plus it's going to two gigs of ram
 

543
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,150
that plus it's going to two gigs of ram
so but it has an emmc emmc port on it so

544
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,160
so but it has an emmc emmc port on it so
 

545
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,940
so but it has an emmc emmc port on it so
right you can you can plug an emmc

546
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:11,950
right you can you can plug an emmc
 

547
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,740
right you can you can plug an emmc
instead of using the SD card which is

548
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:13,750
instead of using the SD card which is
 

549
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,740
instead of using the SD card which is
exactly why it's more reliable although

550
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:16,750
exactly why it's more reliable although
 

551
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,570
exactly why it's more reliable although
the power thing with the Raspberry Pi is

552
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:18,580
the power thing with the Raspberry Pi is
 

553
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,320
the power thing with the Raspberry Pi is
it seems to be a real issue like I I

554
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,330
it seems to be a real issue like I I
 

555
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,080
it seems to be a real issue like I I
have had I did not realize get damaged

556
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,090
have had I did not realize get damaged
 

557
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,990
have had I did not realize get damaged
now I did not realize that the it was a

558
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
now I did not realize that the it was a
 

559
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,990
now I did not realize that the it was a
an issue specific to the Raspberry Pi I

560
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,000
an issue specific to the Raspberry Pi I
 

561
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,260
an issue specific to the Raspberry Pi I
thought it was an SPCC issue global him

562
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,270
thought it was an SPCC issue global him
 

563
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,090
thought it was an SPCC issue global him
I've never had it happen with any other

yeah definitely gonna look at the
 

573
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,530
yeah definitely gonna look at the
AirDroid for sure I like it a lot what

574
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:55,540

do you think bill xu4 is probably a good

576
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,070
do you think bill xu4 is probably a good
 

577
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,850

drop in like one to one comparable but I

578
00:18:59,850 --> 00:18:59,860
drop in like one to one comparable but I
 

579
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,400
drop in like one to one comparable but I
think the end too if I was looking to

580
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,410
think the end too if I was looking to
 

581
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,260
think the end too if I was looking to
actually build like a pretty nice little

582
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,270
actually build like a pretty nice little
 

583
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,540
actually build like a pretty nice little
system to end to or maybe the HC one

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:06,550
system to end to or maybe the HC one
 

585
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,300
system to end to or maybe the HC one
would be a the way to go so the HTC one

586
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:09,310
would be a the way to go so the HTC one
 

587
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,950
would be a the way to go so the HTC one
being the one that has a you could plug

an SSD into it let's just see I'll be
 

591
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,180
an SSD into it let's just see I'll be
happy to get a more powerful SP saying

stuff like that so I don't think this PC

602
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,100
stuff like that so I don't think this PC
 

603
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,890
stuff like that so I don't think this PC
can do that I think it has to be at this

I'm looking to do an object you would
 

645
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,510
I'm looking to do an object you would
know better than I would I have an mp4

646
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
know better than I would I have an mp4
 

647
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,430
know better than I would I have an mp4
so it's a video file okay I want to I

648
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:50,440
so it's a video file okay I want to I
 

649

want to split the first few minutes have
 

651
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,620
want to split the first few minutes have
any mp4 I'm sure there are tools on

652
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:58,630
any mp4 I'm sure there are tools on
 

653
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,200
any mp4 I'm sure there are tools on
Linux that will just do that right mm-hm

654
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,210
Linux that will just do that right mm-hm
 

655
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,539
Linux that will just do that right mm-hm
yeah ffmpeg in the command line you can

656
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:03,549
yeah ffmpeg in the command line you can
 

657
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:06,659
yeah ffmpeg in the command line you can
oh that's perfect

658
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:06,669

 

659
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:09,600

I already used that to to transcribe

660
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:09,610
I already used that to to transcribe
 

661
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,480
I already used that to to transcribe
from one resolution to another round

662
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,490
from one resolution to another round
 

663
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,950
from one resolution to another round
some of the videos I haven't like 4k and

664
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:15,960
some of the videos I haven't like 4k and
 

665
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,710
some of the videos I haven't like 4k and
right and they have to be transcoded on

666
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:19,720
right and they have to be transcoded on
 

667
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:35,100
right and they have to be transcoded on
the fly to my to my 1k just take that or

668
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,110
the fly to my to my 1k just take that or
 

669
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:41,279
the fly to my to my 1k just take that or
the most used method is to encode there

670
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:41,289
the most used method is to encode there
 

671
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:43,470
the most used method is to encode there
a few minutes there that you that you

672
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:43,480
a few minutes there that you that you
 

673
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,830
a few minutes there that you that you
need that is the easiest way to find the

674
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:46,840
need that is the easiest way to find the
 

675
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,049
need that is the easiest way to find the
guide somehow to do but you just simply

676
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:49,059
guide somehow to do but you just simply
 

677
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,980
guide somehow to do but you just simply
take their first few minutes and not

678
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:51,990
take their first few minutes and not
 

679
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,169
take their first few minutes and not
re-encoded afterwards I know you can do

680
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:55,179
re-encoded afterwards I know you can do
 

681
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:59,490
re-encoded afterwards I know you can do
that but it's hard to find it already

682
00:21:59,490 --> 00:21:59,500
that but it's hard to find it already
 

683
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,409
that but it's hard to find it already
yet the resolution and everything that I

684
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:01,419
yet the resolution and everything that I
 

685
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:03,210
yet the resolution and everything that I
want I just want to cut those first few

686
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:03,220
want I just want to cut those first few
 

687
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,710
want I just want to cut those first few
minutes here

688
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
minutes here
 

689
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,240
minutes here
so yeah that's what I'll do all right

690

tons of stuff I use ffmpeg to transcode

706
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,450
tons of stuff I use ffmpeg to transcode
 

707
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,650
tons of stuff I use ffmpeg to transcode
from h.265 to h.264 because I don't have

708

735
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,240
don't yeah you're right don't don't rien
code because then you're actually having

736
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,250
code because then you're actually having
 

737
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,730
code because then you're actually having
to wait for it to read

738
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:39,740
to wait for it to read
 

739
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,260
to wait for it to read
but that's ffmpeg has the - be : copy so

740
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,270
but that's ffmpeg has the - be : copy so
 

741
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,390
but that's ffmpeg has the - be : copy so
that that will just copy the video but

742
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
that that will just copy the video but
 

743
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,100
that that will just copy the video but
yeah you're right hmm oh boy I think we

744
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,110
yeah you're right hmm oh boy I think we
 

745
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,570
yeah you're right hmm oh boy I think we
are almost out of time it's hard to know

746
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:52,580
are almost out of time it's hard to know
 

747
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,890
are almost out of time it's hard to know

757
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,450
room 11:26 so I did some more just some
real quick degree I agree with the with

758
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:10,460
real quick degree I agree with the with
 

759
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,419
real quick degree I agree with the with
the point time I looked up the display

760
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:13,429
the point time I looked up the display
 

761
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:16,210
the point time I looked up the display
documentation to try and understand had

762
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:16,220
documentation to try and understand had
 

763
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,690
documentation to try and understand had
like a wouldn't it's around

764
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:18,700
like a wouldn't it's around
 

765
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,680
like a wouldn't it's around
described and it looks the it looks like

766
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:22,690
described and it looks the it looks like
 

767
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:29,590
described and it looks the it looks like
the 0-0 coordinate or pixel is in the

768
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
the 0-0 coordinate or pixel is in the
 

769
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,450
the 0-0 coordinate or pixel is in the
top left-hand corner or let's top

770
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:31,460
top left-hand corner or let's top
 

771
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,330
top left-hand corner or let's top
left-hand corner for me but yeah that's

772
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:34,340
left-hand corner for me but yeah that's
 

773
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,590
left-hand corner for me but yeah that's
at you yeah and then X works normally

774
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:38,600
at you yeah and then X works normally
 

775
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,139
at you yeah and then X works normally
right that is that it runs across to the

776
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:41,149
right that is that it runs across to the
 

777
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:45,130
right that is that it runs across to the
right but it looks like Y increases as

be 248 crops and 320 down now which is

812
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:40,100
be 248 crops and 320 down now which is
 

813
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:47,019
be 248 crops and 320 down now which is
given the mode but it's a square I think

814
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:47,029
given the mode but it's a square I think
 

815
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,330
given the mode but it's a square I think
there's an on display area top and

816
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:49,340
there's an on display area top and
 

817
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,519
there's an on display area top and
bottom of the of the vertical part so I

818
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:51,529
bottom of the of the vertical part so I
 

819
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:59,190
bottom of the of the vertical part so I
think it might are cropped to 240 by 240

820
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200

 

821
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,620
