single board computers and he says oh

628
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:33,860
single board computers and he says oh
 

629
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,930
single board computers and he says oh
that m2 there and the rock pro 64 both

630
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:37,940
that m2 there and the rock pro 64 both
 

631
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:46,570
that m2 there and the rock pro 64 both
12-volt boards well so that means that I

632
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:46,580
12-volt boards well so that means that I
 

633
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,900
12-volt boards well so that means that I
would either have to put in a second

634
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:49,910
would either have to put in a second
 

635
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,060
would either have to put in a second
power supply to power a 12 volt rail or

636
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,070
power supply to power a 12 volt rail or
 

637
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,010
power supply to power a 12 volt rail or
and then we run into a problem where I'd

638
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,020
and then we run into a problem where I'd
 

639
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,200
and then we run into a problem where I'd
have to have a second fuse panel so I

640
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,210
have to have a second fuse panel so I
 

641
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,660
have to have a second fuse panel so I
suggested that okay let's let's remove

642
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:01,670
suggested that okay let's let's remove
 

643
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,670
suggested that okay let's let's remove
the 12 volt boards I'm gonna get those

644
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:03,680
the 12 volt boards I'm gonna get those
 

645
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,890
the 12 volt boards I'm gonna get those
out of there and instead I'm gonna just

646
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:05,900
out of there and instead I'm gonna just
 

647
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,240
out of there and instead I'm gonna just
go with 5 volt you've got three drone

648
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,250
go with 5 volt you've got three drone
 

649
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,200
go with 5 volt you've got three drone
experience right from years ago yeah we

650
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,210
experience right from years ago yeah we
 

651
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,020
experience right from years ago yeah we
did the drone zone oh so I have way too

652
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,030
did the drone zone oh so I have way too
 

653
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,380
did the drone zone oh so I have way too
many oh I'm sorry I just wanted to ask

654
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,390
many oh I'm sorry I just wanted to ask
 

655
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,450
many oh I'm sorry I just wanted to ask
are you familiar with the ubiquitous

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:24,440
regulators that was they can they can
 

659
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,040
regulators that was they can they can
take that 12 volts and drop it to 5

660
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,050
take that 12 volts and drop it to 5
 

661
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,230
take that 12 volts and drop it to 5
volts without any problem at all if you

662
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:29,240
volts without any problem at all if you
 

663
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,330
volts without any problem at all if you
want to do something like that both

664
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:31,340
want to do something like that both
 

665
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,820
want to do something like that both
showed us a step-down converter that you

666
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:33,830
showed us a step-down converter that you
 

667
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,720
showed us a step-down converter that you
can selectively

668
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,730
can selectively
 

669
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,270
can selectively
turn a dial and it will set the voltage

670
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
turn a dial and it will set the voltage
 

671
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,850
turn a dial and it will set the voltage
so you just use a voltmeter and the

672
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:39,860
so you just use a voltmeter and the
 

673
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,590
so you just use a voltmeter and the
voltmeter will show so as soon as I get

674
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
voltmeter will show so as soon as I get
 

675
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,710
voltmeter will show so as soon as I get
down to about five and then then I've

676
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
down to about five and then then I've
 

677
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:59,160
down to about five and then then I've
done I'll plug my boards in good yeah

678
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,170

 

679
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,110

what what bo and I were talking about is

680
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,120
what what bo and I were talking about is
 

681
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,990
what what bo and I were talking about is
using to step down controllers to step

682
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,000
using to step down controllers to step
 

683
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,200
using to step down controllers to step
downs and 219 volt 135 watt power

684
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,210
downs and 219 volt 135 watt power
 

685
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,750
downs and 219 volt 135 watt power
supplies from laptops and then just

686
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
supplies from laptops and then just
 

687
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,900
supplies from laptops and then just
running them in a in a parallel circuit

688
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:16,910
running them in a in a parallel circuit
 

689
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,970
running them in a in a parallel circuit
so that if one of the power supplies

690
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:18,980
so that if one of the power supplies
 

691
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,330
so that if one of the power supplies
dies the second one is redundant okay

692
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:24,340
dies the second one is redundant okay
 

693
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,560
dies the second one is redundant okay
and you you're gonna feed them in

694
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:26,570
and you you're gonna feed them in
 

695
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,710
and you you're gonna feed them in
parallel or something so that's Josh

696
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
parallel or something so that's Josh
 

697
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,850
parallel or something so that's Josh
shut up exactly well both would always

698
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:33,860
shut up exactly well both would always
 

699
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,860
shut up exactly well both would always
be powered up and then if one dies the

700
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:35,870
be powered up and then if one dies the
 

701
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,870
be powered up and then if one dies the
other one is able to carry the load but

702
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:37,880
other one is able to carry the load but
 

703
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,330
other one is able to carry the load but
can one carry the load of oldest ESP

704
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:40,340
can one carry the load of oldest ESP
 

705
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,870
can one carry the load of oldest ESP
sheesh

706
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
sheesh

actually even know the property like
 

749
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,210
actually even know the property like
they've grew up there so he knows I

750

they've grew up there so he knows I
 

751
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,799
they've grew up there so he knows I
think it's like two acres or something

we were just going and visiting so there
 

775
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,580
we were just going and visiting so there
was no need for me to do the basement or

776
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:48,590
was no need for me to do the basement or
 

777
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,260
was no need for me to do the basement or
the attic or go for a walk through the
