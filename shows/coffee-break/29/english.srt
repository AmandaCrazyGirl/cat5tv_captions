10 machine and if it works if it works
then you know that the to the five years

464
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:42,580
then you know that the to the five years
 

465
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,840
then you know that the to the five years
between they've improved something or

466
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:44,850
between they've improved something or
 

467
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,100
between they've improved something or
increased a version of something that is

468
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,110
increased a version of something that is
 

469
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,380
increased a version of something that is
fixed it for you and then that answers

470
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,390
fixed it for you and then that answers
 

471
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,540
fixed it for you and then that answers
the question should you upgrade and that

472
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:51,550
the question should you upgrade and that
 

473
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,370
the question should you upgrade and that
will fix it locking me in oh I see the

474
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:56,380
will fix it locking me in oh I see the
 

475
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,740
will fix it locking me in oh I see the
Sun it's so sunny the Sun is reflecting

476
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:58,750
Sun it's so sunny the Sun is reflecting
 

477
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,210
Sun it's so sunny the Sun is reflecting
off the van that's what's happening

478
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,220
off the van that's what's happening
 

479
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,710
off the van that's what's happening
oh yeah it's a nice day very vp9 you

480
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
oh yeah it's a nice day very vp9 you
 

481
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,260
oh yeah it's a nice day very vp9 you
were gonna say something I was just

482
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,270
were gonna say something I was just
 

483
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,300
were gonna say something I was just
gonna talk about the pond time some more

484
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,310
gonna talk about the pond time some more
 

485
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,290
gonna talk about the pond time some more
have been doing some nothing serious

486
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:14,300
have been doing some nothing serious
 

487
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,660
have been doing some nothing serious
this monkey curry that's a win it's when

488
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:16,670
this monkey curry that's a win it's when
 

489
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,490
this monkey curry that's a win it's when
this thing actually arrives he's gonna

490
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:18,500
this thing actually arrives he's gonna
 

491
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,990
this thing actually arrives he's gonna
hold it in his hands and he won't know

492
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
hold it in his hands and he won't know
 

493
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,710
hold it in his hands and he won't know
what to say I know like I know I've

494
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:23,720
what to say I know like I know I've
 

495
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,060
what to say I know like I know I've
already I've already told you everything

496
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,070
already I've already told you everything
 

497
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:38,110
already I've already told you everything
there is to know but it's here come on

498
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,120
there is to know but it's here come on
 

499
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,770
there is to know but it's here come on
give me a break but I will say just to

500
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:41,780
give me a break but I will say just to
 

501
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,230
give me a break but I will say just to
let you know Robby I think you should be

502
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
let you know Robby I think you should be
 

503
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,840
let you know Robby I think you should be
aware I think it was two or three days

504
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:46,850
aware I think it was two or three days
 

505
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,690
aware I think it was two or three days
ago two or three coffee breaks ago you

506
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:49,700
ago two or three coffee breaks ago you
 

507
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,670
ago two or three coffee breaks ago you
mentioned the way to figure out if the

508
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
mentioned the way to figure out if the
 

509
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,170
mentioned the way to figure out if the
screen what the resolution of the screen

510
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,180
screen what the resolution of the screen
 

511
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,750
screen what the resolution of the screen
was you're not gonna touch the screen at

512
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:58,760
was you're not gonna touch the screen at
 

513
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,380
was you're not gonna touch the screen at
the bottom right hand corner yeah get

514
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,390
the bottom right hand corner yeah get
 

515
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,250
the bottom right hand corner yeah get
the XY coordinates of that touch event I

516
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,260
the XY coordinates of that touch event I
 

517
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,930
the XY coordinates of that touch event I
don't know if you realize this but the

518
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:07,940
don't know if you realize this but the
 

519
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,620
don't know if you realize this but the
the capacitive touch portion is actually

520
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:11,630
the capacitive touch portion is actually
 

521
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,160
the capacitive touch portion is actually
a separate component from the screen and

522
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,170
a separate component from the screen and
 

523
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,680
a separate component from the screen and
mainly it's not it's not built into the

524
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:17,690
mainly it's not it's not built into the
 

525
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,600
mainly it's not it's not built into the
screen I think it's I think it's a piece

526
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:19,610
screen I think it's I think it's a piece
 

527
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,200
screen I think it's I think it's a piece
that goes over the screen and it it may

528
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,210
that goes over the screen and it it may
 

529
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,910
that goes over the screen and it it may
use different coordinates to I know

530
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:24,920
use different coordinates to I know
 

531
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,160
use different coordinates to I know
exactly what you're saying so the X Y is

532
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,170
exactly what you're saying so the X Y is
 

533
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,710
exactly what you're saying so the X Y is
not necessarily representative of the

534
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:29,720
not necessarily representative of the
 

535
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,330
not necessarily representative of the
pixels correct to warn you about that

536
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,340
pixels correct to warn you about that
 

537
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,300
pixels correct to warn you about that
because yeah I in the documentation that

538
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,310
because yeah I in the documentation that
 

539
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,050
because yeah I in the documentation that
shows up as as two separate devices now

540
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,060
shows up as as two separate devices now
 

541
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,840
shows up as as two separate devices now
they may then you may address them as

542
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:43,850
they may then you may address them as
 

543
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,460
they may then you may address them as
two separate devices I don't know what

544
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,470
two separate devices I don't know what
 

545
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,860
two separate devices I don't know what
the screen looks like it does appear

546
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:47,870
the screen looks like it does appear
 

547
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,190
the screen looks like it does appear
though that they are two separate W you

548
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,200
though that they are two separate W you
 

549
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,950
though that they are two separate W you
know they come together to make the unit

550
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:53,960
know they come together to make the unit
 

551
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,130
know they come together to make the unit
so what if I was just just because we

552
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,140
so what if I was just just because we
 

553
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,610
so what if I was just just because we
can

554
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:57,620
can
 

555
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,020
can
and just cuz it might be a little bit of

556
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,030
and just cuz it might be a little bit of
 

557
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,020
and just cuz it might be a little bit of
a fun experiment what if I was to put

558
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,030
a fun experiment what if I was to put
 

559
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,600
a fun experiment what if I was to put
the pine time once it arrived fire up

560
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:04,610
the pine time once it arrived fire up
 

561
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,310
the pine time once it arrived fire up
the screen and just make it white or red

562
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
the screen and just make it white or red
 

563
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,360
the screen and just make it white or red
or something and then use my

564
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,370
or something and then use my
 

565
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,780
or something and then use my
electromagnet Oh microscope and actually

566
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:13,790
electromagnet Oh microscope and actually
 

567
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,670
electromagnet Oh microscope and actually
look like count the pixels across

568
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
look like count the pixels across
 

569
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,450
look like count the pixels across
well why not right well you could do

570
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:19,460
well why not right well you could do
 

571
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,930
well why not right well you could do
that yeah go for it absolutely let's do

572
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:22,940
that yeah go for it absolutely let's do
 

573
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,250
that yeah go for it absolutely let's do
that cool

574
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:27,260
that cool
 

575
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,670
that cool
I will use that lost count halfway

576
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
I will use that lost count halfway
 

577
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:42,010
I will use that lost count halfway
through the disk you'll be able to keep

578
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,020
through the disk you'll be able to keep
 

579
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:48,640
through the disk you'll be able to keep
track totally try that it will come

580
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:48,650
track totally try that it will come
 

581
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,100
track totally try that it will come
pre-installed with a with an app already

582
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,110
pre-installed with a with an app already
 

583
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,720
pre-installed with a with an app already
installed on it you should be aware of

584
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:52,730
installed on it you should be aware of
 

585
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,880
installed on it you should be aware of
that and ok apparently allows you to get

586
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:57,890
that and ok apparently allows you to get
 

587
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,530
that and ok apparently allows you to get
your your um a heart rate and your blood

588
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:02,540
your your um a heart rate and your blood
 

589
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,190
your your um a heart rate and your blood
pressure

590
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,200
pressure
 

591
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,680
pressure
I could according to the screenshot that

592
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:05,690
I could according to the screenshot that
 

593
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,230
I could according to the screenshot that
I've seen yeah I know and I want to see

594
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
I've seen yeah I know and I want to see
 

595
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,300
I've seen yeah I know and I want to see
if it does that now that app is closed

596
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,310
if it does that now that app is closed
 

597
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,820
if it does that now that app is closed
source the author will not able source

598
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:12,830
source the author will not able source
 

599
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,620
source the author will not able source
for that so I don't know how to make I

600
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:16,630
for that so I don't know how to make I
 

601
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,880
for that so I don't know how to make I
haven't even looked yet at the Stata

602
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:18,890
haven't even looked yet at the Stata
 

603
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,330
haven't even looked yet at the Stata
Center to see how to make it pull heart

604
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:22,340
Center to see how to make it pull heart
 

605
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,790
Center to see how to make it pull heart
rate or blood pressure so we'll have to

606
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
rate or blood pressure so we'll have to
 

607
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,710
rate or blood pressure so we'll have to
see what that does so yeah I think the

608
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
see what that does so yeah I think the
 

609
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,360
see what that does so yeah I think the
key thing with that too is that it

610
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,370
key thing with that too is that it
 

611
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,910
key thing with that too is that it
doesn't have to be app stuff like it

612
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:30,920
doesn't have to be app stuff like it
 

613
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,130
doesn't have to be app stuff like it
just has to log the data and then you

614
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,140
just has to log the data and then you
 

615
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,990
just has to log the data and then you
just have to have a more powerful system

616
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,000
just have to have a more powerful system
 

617
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,870
just have to have a more powerful system
to import and aggregate that it's true

618
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:37,880
to import and aggregate that it's true
 

619
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,830
to import and aggregate that it's true
but as a think I've mentioned before

620
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:41,840
but as a think I've mentioned before
 

621
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,230
but as a think I've mentioned before
this particular device works much like

622
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,240
this particular device works much like
 

623
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,680
this particular device works much like
an Arduino in that you don't load

624
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:50,690
an Arduino in that you don't load
 

625
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,030
an Arduino in that you don't load
individual apps into this device you

626
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
individual apps into this device you
 

627
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,250
individual apps into this device you
have to yeah the right height of that by

628
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,260
have to yeah the right height of that by
 

629
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,430
have to yeah the right height of that by
a single program that runs as an

630
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:00,440
a single program that runs as an
 

631
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,160
a single program that runs as an
executable on that device and it and

632
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,170
executable on that device and it and
 

633
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,020
executable on that device and it and
then that program has to deal with

634
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,030
then that program has to deal with
 

635
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,920
then that program has to deal with
everything so so let's do like every 30

636
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:08,930
everything so so let's do like every 30
 

637
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,550
everything so so let's do like every 30
seconds let's record the data in a JSON

638
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:12,560
seconds let's record the data in a JSON
 

639
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,640
seconds let's record the data in a JSON
file or something sure from the sensor

640
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:15,650
file or something sure from the sensor
 

641
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,770
file or something sure from the sensor
and then we now have it sync with either

642
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:17,780
and then we now have it sync with either
 

643
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,579
and then we now have it sync with either
an app on the phone or a Raspberry Pi

644
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:20,589
an app on the phone or a Raspberry Pi
 

645
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,740
an app on the phone or a Raspberry Pi
running a JavaScript app or something

646
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:23,750
running a JavaScript app or something
 

647
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,490
running a JavaScript app or something
that pulls that data yep remember that

648
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:27,500
that pulls that data yep remember that
 

649
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,050
that pulls that data yep remember that
the pine phone which is what I'm hoping

650
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,060
the pine phone which is what I'm hoping
 

651
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,630
the pine phone which is what I'm hoping
to pair this with is running Linux so

652
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:31,640
to pair this with is running Linux so
 

653
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,060
to pair this with is running Linux so
any any tools that we can build and

654
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,070
any any tools that we can build and
 

655
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,310
any any tools that we can build and
ranks should work with the with the pine

656
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
ranks should work with the with the pine
 

657
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,560
ranks should work with the with the pine
cone that would be my aim right

658
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:40,570
cone that would be my aim right
 

659
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,360
cone that would be my aim right
and they stasis the smartband takes hot

660
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,370
and they stasis the smartband takes hot
 

661
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,540
and they stasis the smartband takes hot
rate every 10 minutes I think it is or

662
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:48,550
rate every 10 minutes I think it is or
 

663
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,820
rate every 10 minutes I think it is or
every 30 minutes something like that and

664
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:50,830
every 30 minutes something like that and
 

665
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,340
every 30 minutes something like that and
Cory lecture every hour yeah yeah see I

666
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,350
Cory lecture every hour yeah yeah see I
 

667
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,470
Cory lecture every hour yeah yeah see I
my that's the trigger that I train no my

668
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
my that's the trigger that I train no my
 

669
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,350
my that's the trigger that I train no my
the mine yeah I have to actually

670
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
the mine yeah I have to actually
 

671
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,410
the mine yeah I have to actually
initiate the the the blood pressure

672
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:04,420
initiate the the the blood pressure
 

673
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,870
initiate the the the blood pressure
monitor now the heart rate know why

674
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
monitor now the heart rate know why
 

675
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:15,480
monitor now the heart rate know why
you're waving so boo but hello oh hi

mine goes but a blood pressure you have

698
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,430
mine goes but a blood pressure you have

00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,370
mine goes but a blood pressure you have
to you have to have your arm at the

700
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:50,380
to you have to have your arm at the
 

701
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,080
to you have to have your arm at the
level of your heart in order for it to

702
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,090
level of your heart in order for it to
 

703
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,360
level of your heart in order for it to
be accurate there so it doesn't make any

704
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,370
be accurate there so it doesn't make any
 

705
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,910
be accurate there so it doesn't make any
sense for it to be running automatically

706
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:56,920
sense for it to be running automatically
 

707
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,020
sense for it to be running automatically
every thirty seconds because then you're

708
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,030
every thirty seconds because then you're
 

709
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,000
every thirty seconds because then you're
gonna get inaccurate measurements every

710
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,010
gonna get inaccurate measurements every
 

711
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,920
gonna get inaccurate measurements every
time you're walking with your armor yeah

712
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:01,930
time you're walking with your armor yeah
 

713
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,410
time you're walking with your armor yeah
that's true and especially if you move

714
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:04,420
that's true and especially if you move
 

715
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,200
that's true and especially if you move
around a lot it will loan that which I

716
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,210
around a lot it will loan that which I
 

717
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,970
around a lot it will loan that which I
obviously yeah check the H band app and

718
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:11,980
obviously yeah check the H band app and
 

719
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,760
obviously yeah check the H band app and
you'll find that there is a history page

720
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:14,770
you'll find that there is a history page
 

721
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,720
you'll find that there is a history page
on that app and you'll find that you're

722
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:18,730
on that app and you'll find that you're
 

723
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,150
on that app and you'll find that you're
you're a smart band is dumping its data

724
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:21,160
you're a smart band is dumping its data
 

725
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,560
you're a smart band is dumping its data
to the H band app every you know oh yeah

726
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,570
to the H band app every you know oh yeah
 

727
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,190
to the H band app every you know oh yeah
hour or so yeah and the H band that will

728
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
hour or so yeah and the H band that will
 

729
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,520
hour or so yeah and the H band that will
I think the I think the smart band holds

730
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,530
I think the I think the smart band holds
 

731
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,890
I think the I think the smart band holds
about four days worth of data then it

732
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:34,900
about four days worth of data then it
 

733
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,430
about four days worth of data then it
rolls off oh I see okay yeah you got a

734
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:38,440
rolls off oh I see okay yeah you got a
 

735
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,850
rolls off oh I see okay yeah you got a

778
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:36,750
just and the link for that okay okay I
 

779
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,140
just and the link for that okay okay I
don't know too much about their job need

780
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,150
don't know too much about their job need
 

781
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,540
don't know too much about their job need
young today yeah yeah I think it's just

782
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:42,550
young today yeah yeah I think it's just
 

783
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,950
young today yeah yeah I think it's just
a versioning issue that's all a version

784
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
a versioning issue that's all a version
 

785
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,340
a versioning issue that's all a version
issue of the sharing Damon yeah which is

786
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,350
issue of the sharing Damon yeah which is
 

787
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,820
issue of the sharing Damon yeah which is
called Samba or CIFS on Linux on Windows

788
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:53,830
called Samba or CIFS on Linux on Windows
 

789
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,340
called Samba or CIFS on Linux on Windows
they still call it well they call it SMB

790
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,350
they still call it well they call it SMB
 

791
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,180
they still call it well they call it SMB
on Windows so Windows 10 deprecated the

792
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,190
on Windows so Windows 10 deprecated the
 

793
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,770
on Windows so Windows 10 deprecated the
old version which causes you to lose

794
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:01,780
old version which causes you to lose
 

795
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,090
old version which causes you to lose
access to your old Linux server

796
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,100
access to your old Linux server
 

797
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,950
access to your old Linux server
you just got to enable that yeah hey can

798
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:07,960
you just got to enable that yeah hey can
 

799
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,150
you just got to enable that yeah hey can
I show you guys something that I think

800
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,160
I show you guys something that I think
 

801
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,860
I show you guys something that I think
is gonna save the the show a lot of

802
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:10,870
is gonna save the the show a lot of
 

803
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,150
is gonna save the the show a lot of
money yes I found this and I'm really

804
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,160
money yes I found this and I'm really
 

805
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,190
money yes I found this and I'm really
really excited about this because one of

806
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
really excited about this because one of
 

807
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,630
really excited about this because one of
the things that we need to do we've got

808
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
the things that we need to do we've got
 

809
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,660
the things that we need to do we've got
six new LED lights for the for the new

810
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:21,670
six new LED lights for the for the new
 

811
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,180
six new LED lights for the for the new
studio because you remember the big soft

812
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,190
studio because you remember the big soft
 

813
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,030
studio because you remember the big soft
boxes that we use their massive right

814
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,040
boxes that we use their massive right
 

815
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,360
boxes that we use their massive right
and they take up a lot of floor space so

816
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,370
and they take up a lot of floor space so
 

817
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,549
and they take up a lot of floor space so
I got some LED light panels that are

818
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
I got some LED light panels that are
 

819
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,890
I got some LED light panels that are
about this big they have 6,000 LEDs each

820
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:34,900
about this big they have 6,000 LEDs each
 

821
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,799
about this big they have 6,000 LEDs each
and they're gonna be hanging from the

822
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:37,809
and they're gonna be hanging from the
 

823
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:40,380
and they're gonna be hanging from the
ceiling but traditionally so looking at

824
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,390
ceiling but traditionally so looking at
 

825
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,210
ceiling but traditionally so looking at
photos and everything of other studios

826
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:42,220
photos and everything of other studios
 

827
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
photos and everything of other studios
what they do is they build a trust

828
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,230
what they do is they build a trust
 

829
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,630
what they do is they build a trust
system out of PVC or metal piping that

830
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
system out of PVC or metal piping that
 

831
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,090
system out of PVC or metal piping that
kind of thing and with that trust they

832
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,100
kind of thing and with that trust they
 

833
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,720
kind of thing and with that trust they
then use C clamps to mount the lighting

834
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:53,730
then use C clamps to mount the lighting
 

835
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,210
then use C clamps to mount the lighting
even C clamps alone for 10 C clamps is

836
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:57,220
even C clamps alone for 10 C clamps is
 

837
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,290
even C clamps alone for 10 C clamps is
like 60 bucks the truss work I imagine

838
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:01,300
like 60 bucks the truss work I imagine
 

839
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,120
like 60 bucks the truss work I imagine
is going to cost at least a couple

840
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,130
is going to cost at least a couple
 

841
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,070
is going to cost at least a couple
hundred bucks for the hardware plus the

842
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,080
hundred bucks for the hardware plus the
 

843
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,890
hundred bucks for the hardware plus the
person to the contract would actually

844
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:07,900
person to the contract would actually
 

845
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,800
person to the contract would actually
sure it mount it so you know you're

846
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:10,810
sure it mount it so you know you're
 

847
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,360
sure it mount it so you know you're
looking probably several hundred dollars

848
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,370
looking probably several hundred dollars
 

849
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,220
looking probably several hundred dollars
just to create this thing to mount our

850
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,230
just to create this thing to mount our
 

851
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,000
just to create this thing to mount our
lighting and then I came across these do

852
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,010
lighting and then I came across these do
 

853
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,210
lighting and then I came across these do
you guys see that what it is it's it's a

854
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:24,220
you guys see that what it is it's it's a
 

855
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,810
you guys see that what it is it's it's a
butterfly clamp that clips to the drop

856
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:27,820
butterfly clamp that clips to the drop
 

857
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,100
butterfly clamp that clips to the drop
ceiling oh so it clips on to the metal

858
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,110
ceiling oh so it clips on to the metal
 

859
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,470
ceiling oh so it clips on to the metal
portion of the drop ceiling and then it

860
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
portion of the drop ceiling and then it
 

861
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,270
portion of the drop ceiling and then it
has the the proper type of mounting for

862
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
has the the proper type of mounting for
 

863
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,520
has the the proper type of mounting for
the lighting so it's actually built or

864
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,530
the lighting so it's actually built or
 

865
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,770
the lighting so it's actually built or
that you cannot hang much white on that

866
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:43,780
that you cannot hang much white on that
 

867
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,700
that you cannot hang much white on that
Robie thing you can put you can counter

868
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:47,710
Robie thing you can put you can counter
 

869
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,610
Robie thing you can put you can counter
that by putting a wire between so inside

870
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:50,620
that by putting a wire between so inside
 

871
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,230
that by putting a wire between so inside
the drop ceiling you mount it up to the

872
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
the drop ceiling you mount it up to the
 

873
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,090
the drop ceiling you mount it up to the
truss work just like I did at studio D

874
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,100
truss work just like I did at studio D
 

875
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,400
truss work just like I did at studio D
with the camera right but look at the

876
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,410
with the camera right but look at the
 

877
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:02,040
with the camera right but look at the
price can you make that out oh seven

878
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,050
price can you make that out oh seven
 

879
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:09,120
price can you make that out oh seven
goals seven dollars that'll be us so

880
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,130
goals seven dollars that'll be us so
 

881
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,820
goals seven dollars that'll be us so
those you wish okay yeah seven dollars -

882
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:11,830
those you wish okay yeah seven dollars -
 

883
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,220
those you wish okay yeah seven dollars -
I was going to say seven dollars

884
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,230
I was going to say seven dollars
 

885
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,650
I was going to say seven dollars
Canadians like 30 cents an American yeah

886
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:16,660
Canadians like 30 cents an American yeah
 

887
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,190
Canadians like 30 cents an American yeah
really

888
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200

 

889
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,350

so like for 50 bucks I'll be able to get

890
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,360
so like for 50 bucks I'll be able to get
 

891
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,660
so like for 50 bucks I'll be able to get
those and like enough for all the

892
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:24,670
those and like enough for all the
 

893
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,000
those and like enough for all the
lighting and and then it just clips and

894
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,010
lighting and and then it just clips and
 

895
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,770
lighting and and then it just clips and
then there's no damage done for the roof

896
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:28,780
then there's no damage done for the roof
 

897
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,950
then there's no damage done for the roof
there's no changes made to the unit

898
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:31,960
there's no changes made to the unit
 

899
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,690
there's no changes made to the unit
it's nice and simple so I can mount that

900
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:36,700
it's nice and simple so I can mount that
 

901
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,420
it's nice and simple so I can mount that
but is it is it safe enough that you you

902
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:39,430
but is it is it safe enough that you you
 

903
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,130
but is it is it safe enough that you you
know that nothing's likely to fall

904
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,140
know that nothing's likely to fall
 

905
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,260
know that nothing's likely to fall
that's probably the biggest concern

906
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,270
that's probably the biggest concern
 

907
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,010
that's probably the biggest concern
right yeah the LED lights vp9 are so

908
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,020
right yeah the LED lights vp9 are so
 

909
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,440
right yeah the LED lights vp9 are so
lightweight like they're they're just

910
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,450
lightweight like they're they're just
 

911
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,750
lightweight like they're they're just
they're this thick they're in this big

912
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
they're this thick they're in this big
 

913
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,490
they're this thick they're in this big
and they pump out just as much

914
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:53,500
and they pump out just as much
 

915
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,320
and they pump out just as much
brightness as those great big honking

916
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,330
brightness as those great big honking
 

917
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,520
brightness as those great big honking
things so yeah remember Leo Laporte was

918
00:23:59,520 --> 00:23:59,530
things so yeah remember Leo Laporte was
 

919
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,310
things so yeah remember Leo Laporte was
there talking about how they did it in

920
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
there talking about how they did it in
 

921
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,640
there talking about how they did it in
the cottage they had before the brick

922
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:05,650
the cottage they had before the brick
 

923
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,440
the cottage they had before the brick
studio I am they rented an old house and

924
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,450
studio I am they rented an old house and
 

925
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,860
studio I am they rented an old house and
they were not allowed to put a single

926
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:13,870
they were not allowed to put a single
 

927
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,780
they were not allowed to put a single
nail or a single screw in the walls so

928
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:15,790
nail or a single screw in the walls so
 

929
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,930
nail or a single screw in the walls so
they have so they had a lot of cameras

930
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:18,940
they have so they had a lot of cameras
 

931
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,509
they have so they had a lot of cameras
and all of the lighting and

932
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:20,519
and all of the lighting and
 

933
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,389
and all of the lighting and
all around and he was still describing

934
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:23,399
all around and he was still describing
 

935
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:26,930
all around and he was still describing
how one of the interns a lady a I don't

936
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:26,940
how one of the interns a lady a I don't
 

937
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,669
how one of the interns a lady a I don't
remember her name and she made a design

938
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
remember her name and she made a design
 

939
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,599
remember her name and she made a design
system with the pipes going all around

940
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:37,609
system with the pipes going all around
 

941
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,909
system with the pipes going all around
and they hang there and they did what

942
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:40,919
and they hang there and they did what
 

943
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,729
and they hang there and they did what
you describe as your initial plan until

944
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:43,739
you describe as your initial plan until
 

945
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,940
you describe as your initial plan until
they came up with that right so that's

946
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:46,950
they came up with that right so that's
 

947
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,440
they came up with that right so that's
pretty traditional

948
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,450
pretty traditional
 

949
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,959
pretty traditional
yeah the Hank hanging truss system is

950
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:50,969
yeah the Hank hanging truss system is
 

951
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,430
yeah the Hank hanging truss system is
pretty traditional like if you do a

952
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:52,440
pretty traditional like if you do a
 

953
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,099
pretty traditional like if you do a
search for studios that seems to be the

954
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:55,109
search for studios that seems to be the
 

955
00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:57,769
search for studios that seems to be the
way to do it but this is gonna save so

956
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:57,779
way to do it but this is gonna save so
 

957
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,409
way to do it but this is gonna save so
much money and it's gonna do the exact

958
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:00,419
much money and it's gonna do the exact
 

959
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,729
much money and it's gonna do the exact
same job noise yeah now you've got the

960
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:04,739
same job noise yeah now you've got the
 

961
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:11,569
same job noise yeah now you've got the
drop ceiling so you've got those tiles

962
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:11,579
drop ceiling so you've got those tiles
 

963
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,479
drop ceiling so you've got those tiles
hold those files those roof tiles yes

964
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:14,489
hold those files those roof tiles yes
 

965
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,219
hold those files those roof tiles yes
just lift them to hook the thing in is

966
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:16,229
just lift them to hook the thing in is
 

967
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:18,349
just lift them to hook the thing in is
that how it works well the metal piece

968
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:18,359
that how it works well the metal piece
 

969
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,190
that how it works well the metal piece
that the tiles are sitting on yes this

970
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,200
that the tiles are sitting on yes this
 

971
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,919
that the tiles are sitting on yes this
clips on to that metal piece okay they

972
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:24,929
clips on to that metal piece okay they
 

973
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:27,049
clips on to that metal piece okay they
don't even know the tiles to make up no

974
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:27,059
don't even know the tiles to make up no
 

975
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:31,669
don't even know the tiles to make up no
no reason on it sorry

976
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
no reason on it sorry
 

977
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,489
no reason on it sorry
yeah so is that kind of limit your where

978
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:34,499
yeah so is that kind of limit your where
 

979
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,839
yeah so is that kind of limit your where
you're able to place the lighting yes

980
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:38,849
you're able to place the lighting yes
 

981
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,940
you're able to place the lighting yes
but considering it's ten feet up in the

982
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:40,950
but considering it's ten feet up in the
 

983
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,399
but considering it's ten feet up in the
air and you're using shutter doors to

984
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:43,409
air and you're using shutter doors to
 

985
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,430
air and you're using shutter doors to
control where the lighting goes it's

986
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,440
control where the lighting goes it's
 

987
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,839
control where the lighting goes it's
like you're gonna have I'm gonna have

988
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:47,849
like you're gonna have I'm gonna have
 

989
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,659
like you're gonna have I'm gonna have
it's it's gonna be flood right it's not

990
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:50,669
it's it's gonna be flood right it's not
 

991
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:52,399
it's it's gonna be flood right it's not
like a direction it's not directional

992
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:52,409
like a direction it's not directional
 

993
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:53,810
like a direction it's not directional
spots or anything like that these are

994
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:53,820
spots or anything like that these are
 

995
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,419
spots or anything like that these are
floods so as long as it's up in the air

996
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:56,429
floods so as long as it's up in the air
 

997
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,639
floods so as long as it's up in the air
and back far enough it'll it'll just

998
00:25:58,639 --> 00:25:58,649
and back far enough it'll it'll just
 

999
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,499
and back far enough it'll it'll just
fill the room with light that's all we

1000
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:00,509
fill the room with light that's all we
 

1001
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,989
fill the room with light that's all we
need mmm and then enough of them that we

1002
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:02,999
need mmm and then enough of them that we
 

1003
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:07,159
need mmm and then enough of them that we
don't have shadows good yeah so we'll

1004
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:07,169
don't have shadows good yeah so we'll
 

1005
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,889
don't have shadows good yeah so we'll
see how that goes I'm excited too

1006
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:11,899
see how that goes I'm excited too
 

1007
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:14,269
see how that goes I'm excited too
everything that I've been ordering is

1008
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:14,279
everything that I've been ordering is
 

1009
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,729
everything that I've been ordering is
taking longer than it's supposed to so

1010
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:16,739
taking longer than it's supposed to so
 

1011
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,529
taking longer than it's supposed to so
it's always like my shipment that was

1012
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:18,539
it's always like my shipment that was
 

1013
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,029
it's always like my shipment that was
supposed to be here Friday didn't arrive

1014
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:20,039
supposed to be here Friday didn't arrive
 

1015
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,729
supposed to be here Friday didn't arrive
so I'm like oh oh that's again and I

1016
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:22,739
so I'm like oh oh that's again and I
 

1017
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:24,889
so I'm like oh oh that's again and I
didn't get the the Power Distribution

1018
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:24,899
didn't get the the Power Distribution
 

1019
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,560
didn't get the the Power Distribution
unit for the server rack so I don't have

1020
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:27,570
unit for the server rack so I don't have
 

1021
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,279
unit for the server rack so I don't have
power in the server rack still so one

1022
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:31,289
power in the server rack still so one
 

1023
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,019
power in the server rack still so one
question a very quick question about

1024
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:33,029
question a very quick question about
 

1025
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,890
question a very quick question about
that I

1026
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:33,900
that I
 

1027
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,990
that I
we've mentioned this before but if

1028
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
we've mentioned this before but if
 

1029
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,390
we've mentioned this before but if
you're feeding boards that are 5 volts

1030
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
you're feeding boards that are 5 volts
 

1031
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,330
you're feeding boards that are 5 volts
and 12 volts instead of using a laptop

1032
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,340
and 12 volts instead of using a laptop
 

1033
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,330
and 12 volts instead of using a laptop
power supply haven't we've talked about

1034
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:44,340
power supply haven't we've talked about
 

1035
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,310
power supply haven't we've talked about
using a switching power supply

1036
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
using a switching power supply
 

1037
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,580
using a switching power supply
cannibalized from a PC enclosure haven't

1038
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,590
cannibalized from a PC enclosure haven't
 

1039
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,130
cannibalized from a PC enclosure haven't
we and that is that that will give you

1040
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,140
we and that is that that will give you
 

1041
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,710
we and that is that that will give you
12 volts and 5 out of exactly the same

1042
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
12 volts and 5 out of exactly the same
 

1043
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,350
12 volts and 5 out of exactly the same
plan yeah yeah they're actually the same

1044
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
plan yeah yeah they're actually the same
 

1045
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,420
plan yeah yeah they're actually the same
plug the issue with that is that then it

1046
00:26:59,420 --> 00:26:59,430
plug the issue with that is that then it
 

1047
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,620
plug the issue with that is that then it
would have to be an external power

1048
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:00,630
would have to be an external power
 

1049
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,800
would have to be an external power
supply that is an ATX power supply

1050
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:03,810
supply that is an ATX power supply
 

1051
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,470
supply that is an ATX power supply
because it's a 1u server right well your

1052
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
because it's a 1u server right well your
 

1053
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
because it's a 1u server right well your
brick is an external power supply - is

1054
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,490
brick is an external power supply - is
 

1055
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,820
brick is an external power supply - is
it not yeah but it's like a it's a nice

1056
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:10,830
it not yeah but it's like a it's a nice
 

1057
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,370
it not yeah but it's like a it's a nice
you know like a power cord from a laptop

1058
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,380
you know like a power cord from a laptop
 

1059
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,770
you know like a power cord from a laptop
so it's just a barrel plug going into

1060
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:15,780
so it's just a barrel plug going into
 

1061
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,720
so it's just a barrel plug going into
the side of the server so I'll just have

1062
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:17,730
the side of the server so I'll just have
 

1063
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,340
the side of the server so I'll just have
to barrel jacks on the back that I just

1064
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:19,350
to barrel jacks on the back that I just
 

1065
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,140
to barrel jacks on the back that I just
plug in - done and done

1066
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,150
plug in - done and done
 

1067
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,380
plug in - done and done
versus having to put an ATX power supply

1068
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,390
versus having to put an ATX power supply
 

1069
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,720
versus having to put an ATX power supply
on top with a big ATX cable coming out

1070
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:26,730
on top with a big ATX cable coming out
 

1071
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,290
on top with a big ATX cable coming out
of it what about using the devil knew

1072
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:32,300
of it what about using the devil knew
 

1073
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,180
of it what about using the devil knew
it's normally used in servers I could

1074
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,190
it's normally used in servers I could
 

1075
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,780
it's normally used in servers I could
but it's so expensive that's all so you

1076
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:38,790
but it's so expensive that's all so you
 

1077
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,750
but it's so expensive that's all so you
know I can get a step down for get it

1078
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:43,760
know I can get a step down for get it
 

1079
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,190
know I can get a step down for get it
and get a step down for just a couple of

1080
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,200
and get a step down for just a couple of
 

1081
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,470
and get a step down for just a couple of
bucks right versus having to go with a

1082
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
bucks right versus having to go with a
 

1083
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,330
bucks right versus having to go with a
what do they call that PTX power supply

1084
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:53,340
what do they call that PTX power supply
 

1085
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,620
what do they call that PTX power supply
for you know so something no idea

1086
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:57,630
for you know so something no idea
 

1087
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,390
for you know so something no idea
it's ie ATX yeah cuz it's it's like

1088
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,400
it's ie ATX yeah cuz it's it's like
 

1089
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,910
it's ie ATX yeah cuz it's it's like
really really tiny right plus they're

1090
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:04,920
really really tiny right plus they're
 

1091
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,370
really really tiny right plus they're
only like I don't know well I guess

1092
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:07,380
only like I don't know well I guess
 

1093
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,780
only like I don't know well I guess
they'd have enough wattage that'd be

1094
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:08,790
they'd have enough wattage that'd be
 

1095
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,890
they'd have enough wattage that'd be
like 300 Watts

1096
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:09,900
like 300 Watts
 

1097
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,950
like 300 Watts
but that'll be between I don't know how

1098
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
but that'll be between I don't know how
 

1099
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,900
but that'll be between I don't know how
it would be divvied I don't know I just

1100
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:14,910
it would be divvied I don't know I just
 

1101
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,000
it would be divvied I don't know I just
think it's a good way to do it but

1102
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,010
think it's a good way to do it but
 

1103
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,220
think it's a good way to do it but
definitely a valid point bp9 I think

1104
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,230
definitely a valid point bp9 I think
 

1105
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,150
definitely a valid point bp9 I think
that's a good slimmer than 2000 scenario

1106
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,160
that's a good slimmer than 2000 scenario
 

1107
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,190
that's a good slimmer than 2000 scenario
when edge will vote for they laugh

1108
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
when edge will vote for they laugh
 

1109
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,530
when edge will vote for they laugh
that'll work and then they go for voters

1110
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:27,540
that'll work and then they go for voters
 

1111
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,090
that'll work and then they go for voters
a like that as well yeah but you could

1112
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:32,100
a like that as well yeah but you could
 

1113
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,840
a like that as well yeah but you could
put the drive the guy it does back

1114
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:35,850
put the drive the guy it does back
 

1115
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,880
put the drive the guy it does back
underneath um like would you that exact

1116
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:37,890
underneath um like would you that exact
 

1117
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,340
underneath um like would you that exact
if they figure and thinking one corner

1118
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,350
if they figure and thinking one corner
 

1119
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,760
if they figure and thinking one corner
somewhere

1120

1128
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:55,700
blank expansion slot on the back like a
 

1129
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,940
blank expansion slot on the back like a
PCI expansion slot so I'm gonna drill

1130
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:57,950
PCI expansion slot so I'm gonna drill
 

1131
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,650
PCI expansion slot so I'm gonna drill
two holes in there and put five

millimeter barrel plug inputs and then

1134
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,170
millimeter barrel plug inputs and then
 

1135
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,780
millimeter barrel plug inputs and then
and I can just plug in power supplies

1136
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:04,790
and I can just plug in power supplies
 

1137
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,720
and I can just plug in power supplies
and and they're just nice neat power
