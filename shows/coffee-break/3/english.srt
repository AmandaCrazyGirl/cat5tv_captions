environmental impact of this like the
 

325
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,700
environmental impact of this like the
actual pollution over it like China and

326
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:20,710
actual pollution over it like China and
 

327

331
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,340
that people's asthma is gonna help clear
up which is actually going to keep them

332
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,350
up which is actually going to keep them
 

333
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:40,440
up which is actually going to keep them
from getting sick a week they can't

334
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,450
from getting sick a week they can't
 

335
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,270
from getting sick a week they can't
remember the last time they have to oh

my gosh
 

339
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,890
my gosh
yeah so maybe there'll be a takeaway

340
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:46,900
yeah so maybe there'll be a takeaway
 

341
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,440
yeah so maybe there'll be a takeaway
from this later when everything heals up

342
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,450
from this later when everything heals up
 

343
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,940
from this later when everything heals up
and clears up that we don't actually

344
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:50,950
and clears up that we don't actually
 

345
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,480
and clears up that we don't actually
need to be doing as much travel we could

346
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,490
need to be doing as much travel we could
 

347
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,600
need to be doing as much travel we could
do a lot more zoom a lot more zoom for

348
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:57,610
do a lot more zoom a lot more zoom for
 

349
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:04,710
do a lot more zoom a lot more zoom for
sure yeah I think that when this thing

350
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
sure yeah I think that when this thing
 

351
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:12,690
sure yeah I think that when this thing
is this pollution in Beijing another big

352
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:12,700
is this pollution in Beijing another big
 

353
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,280
is this pollution in Beijing another big
is it is

354
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,290

 

355
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,499

come back to normal because the

356
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:17,509
come back to normal because the
 

357
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:21,400
come back to normal because the
pollution in China is coal power plants

358
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,410
pollution in China is coal power plants
 

359
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,840
pollution in China is coal power plants
and dirty factories and as soon as they

360
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:25,850
and dirty factories and as soon as they
 

361
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,180
and dirty factories and as soon as they
start up again it deposition is going to

362
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,190
start up again it deposition is going to
 

363
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:38,379
start up again it deposition is going to
come back right it's gonna be even worse

364
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:38,389
come back right it's gonna be even worse
 

365
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,970
come back right it's gonna be even worse
though because like everyone's gonna try

366
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:39,980
though because like everyone's gonna try
 

367
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,680
though because like everyone's gonna try
to be catching up with their workload so

368
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:41,690
to be catching up with their workload so
 

369
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,059
to be catching up with their workload so
now everyone's gonna be working overtime

370
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:43,069
now everyone's gonna be working overtime
 

371
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:55,860
now everyone's gonna be working overtime
just like interesting a theory is that

372
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:55,870
just like interesting a theory is that
 

373
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:04,889
just like interesting a theory is that
this I saw a speech preacher and he is

374

this I saw a speech preacher and he is
 

375
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:10,840
this I saw a speech preacher and he is
he is thinking that this is he if he

376
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:10,850
he is thinking that this is he if he
 

377
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,269
he is thinking that this is he if he
thinks that this is most likely a trial

378
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
thinks that this is most likely a trial
 

379
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,860

that we could actually be doing some
 

821
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,840
that we could actually be doing some

822
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:10,850
repairs on and you know in a in a
 

823
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,090
repairs on and you know in a in a
community in an area we down you're

824
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,100
community in an area we down you're
 

825
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,919
community in an area we down you're
moving I saw the town you're moving to

826
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:17,929
moving I saw the town you're moving to
 

827
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,580

yourself isolated just by being there

828
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:20,590
yourself isolated just by being there
 

829
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:27,690
yourself isolated just by being there
exactly very true but I was I mean I was

830
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:27,700
exactly very true but I was I mean I was
 

831
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,030
exactly very true but I was I mean I was
reading some very sobering statistics

832
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,040
reading some very sobering statistics
 

833
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,270
reading some very sobering statistics
because in Newfoundland the population

834
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:34,280
because in Newfoundland the population
 

835
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,140
because in Newfoundland the population
is aging

836
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,150
is aging
 

837
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,919

if Kovac gets there they risk losing the

838
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:38,929
if Kovac gets there they risk losing the
 

839
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:41,740
if Kovac gets there they risk losing the
majority of their population so that's

840
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:41,750
majority of their population so that's
 

841
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,200
majority of their population so that's
why they're being very stringent on

842
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,210
why they're being very stringent on
 

843
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,900
why they're being very stringent on
who's allowed past the borders at this

844
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:46,910

00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,490
who's allowed past the borders at this
point so we don't know at what point

846
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:48,500
point so we don't know at what point
 

847
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,180
point so we don't know at what point
we'll be able to go we are we're clear

848
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,190
we'll be able to go we are we're clear
