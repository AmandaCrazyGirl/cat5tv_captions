287
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,570

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:37,960
you can see the our hand moves
 

291
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,149
you can see the our hand moves
incrementally as well as the as the time

297
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:52,680
time ticks around yeah I don't update it
more often than that but yeah this this

298
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:52,690
more often than that but yeah this this
 

299
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,559
more often than that but yeah this this
part is done the first part was figuring

300
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:55,569
part is done the first part was figuring
 

301
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,540
part is done the first part was figuring
out where all the XY points were and

302
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:57,550
out where all the XY points were and
 

303
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,240
out where all the XY points were and
generating the source code and then I

304
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,250
generating the source code and then I
 

305
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,980
generating the source code and then I
built this to prove that I could

306
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:01,990
built this to prove that I could
 

307
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,260
built this to prove that I could
actually use that source code to

308
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,270
actually use that source code to
 

309
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,290
actually use that source code to
generate the clockface now I'm looking

310
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:10,300

i I'm pretty sure I remember telling you

326
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:43,269
i I'm pretty sure I remember telling you
 

327
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,780
i I'm pretty sure I remember telling you
initially that I wasn't interested in

328
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:45,790
initially that I wasn't interested in
 

329
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,199
initially that I wasn't interested in
doing that that I wanted to um that I

00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:49,209
doing that that I wanted to um that I
 

331
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,840
doing that that I wanted to um that I
wanted to do this in a victim mode

332

wanted to do this in a victim mode
 

333
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,000
wanted to do this in a victim mode
because I felt like it would be more

334
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,010
because I felt like it would be more

it up then it will it will have to be
 

453
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,200
it up then it will it will have to be
reset at that point right now ultimately

though it will take a Bluetooth you will

456
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:01,820
though it will take a Bluetooth you will
 

457
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,120
though it will take a Bluetooth you will
make a Bluetooth connection called G ATT

569
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:03,240
got a perfectly capable timer you know a
thing the ticks and watch and you would

570
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,250
thing the ticks and watch and you would
 

571
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,340
thing the ticks and watch and you would
think you did a real time you know the

572
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,350
think you did a real time you know the
 

573
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,540
think you did a real time you know the
thing would come with a real-time clock

574
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:06,550
thing would come with a real-time clock
 

575
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,550
thing would come with a real-time clock
but yeah have a real talk

576
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
but yeah have a real talk
 

577
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,430
but yeah have a real talk
think and inviting you know included in

578
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
think and inviting you know included in
 

579
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,530
think and inviting you know included in
it I don't know why but you would think

580
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:13,540
it I don't know why but you would think
 

581
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,200
it I don't know why but you would think
that would be the way to go with it but

582
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,210
that would be the way to go with it but
 

583
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,320
that would be the way to go with it but
know this thing has it just has a timer

584
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,330
know this thing has it just has a timer
 

585
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,750
know this thing has it just has a timer
a thing that that continually ticks and

586
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
a thing that that continually ticks and
 

587
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,510
a thing that that continually ticks and
once you said it once you set up with

588
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:24,520
once you said it once you set up with
 

589
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,430
once you said it once you set up with
the correct time of day it will just

590
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,440
the correct time of day it will just
 

591
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,170
the correct time of day it will just
keep track of the time after that and it

592
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,180
keep track of the time after that and it
 

593
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,790
keep track of the time after that and it
will just keep going I like your idea

594
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:29,800
will just keep going I like your idea
 

595
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,930
will just keep going I like your idea
bp9 to be a

596
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:30,940
bp9 to be a
 

597
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,080
bp9 to be a
to adjust the time yeah after its

598
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,090
to adjust the time yeah after its
 

599
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,000
to adjust the time yeah after its
synched because I have actually have an

synched because I have actually have an
 

601
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,690
synched because I have actually have an

602
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:39,700
atomic an atomic clock whatever it has

that Peters telling us about and it is

606
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:45,460
that Peters telling us about and it is
 

607
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,310
that Peters telling us about and it is
always off by a few minutes and I don't

608
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,320
always off by a few minutes and I don't
 

609
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,430
always off by a few minutes and I don't
know how that's even possible but you

610
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:50,440
know how that's even possible but you
 

611
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,010
know how that's even possible but you
can't adjust it because it's dead set by

612
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,020
can't adjust it because it's dead set by
 

613
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,770
can't adjust it because it's dead set by
the atomic clock so for some reason

614
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:55,780
the atomic clock so for some reason
 

615
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,450
the atomic clock so for some reason
there's something in there that's caused

616
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:57,460
there's something in there that's caused
 

617
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,450
there's something in there that's caused
it to be off by three minutes and you

618
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:00,460
it to be off by three minutes and you
 

619
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,180
it to be off by three minutes and you
can't change it you can't adjust it yes

620
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,190
can't change it you can't adjust it yes
 

621
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,800
can't change it you can't adjust it yes
the reason the reason for the adjustment

622
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:04,810
the reason the reason for the adjustment
 

623
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,020
the reason the reason for the adjustment
is because initially I'm not going to

624
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,030
is because initially I'm not going to
 

625
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,450
is because initially I'm not going to
have any kind of network connectivity at

626
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:09,460
have any kind of network connectivity at
 

627
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,270
have any kind of network connectivity at
all not even bluetooth so if I either or

628
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,280
all not even bluetooth so if I either or
 

629
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,950
all not even bluetooth so if I either or
you could do you could set your time

630
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:13,960
you could do you could set your time
 

631
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,700
you could do you could set your time

632
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:14,710
dolly
 

633
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,630
dolly
yeah now it's gonna be manually adjust

634
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:18,640
yeah now it's gonna be manually adjust
 

635
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,770
yeah now it's gonna be manually adjust
it and I'm gonna my plan is with the

636
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:22,780
it and I'm gonna my plan is with the
 

637
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,200
it and I'm gonna my plan is with the
round clock face that I showed you my

638
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,210
round clock face that I showed you my
 

639
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,870
round clock face that I showed you my
plan is with the two bottom left and

640
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:27,880
plan is with the two bottom left and
 

641
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,790
plan is with the two bottom left and
bottom right spaces there I'm going to

642
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:29,800
bottom right spaces there I'm going to
 

643
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,690
bottom right spaces there I'm going to
turn those into buttons and to allow you

644
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:33,700
turn those into buttons and to allow you
 

645
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
turn those into buttons and to allow you
to cycle through the other the various

646
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:35,710
to cycle through the other the various
 

647
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,600
to cycle through the other the various
other functions of the watch my plan is

648
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,610
other functions of the watch my plan is
 

649
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,600
other functions of the watch my plan is
the top left button is always back so

650
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:42,610
the top left button is always back so
 

651
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,640
the top left button is always back so
you know there's four corners right that

652
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:44,650
you know there's four corners right that
 

653
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,830
you know there's four corners right that
I'm gonna have available and I'm going

654
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm gonna have available and I'm going
 

655
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,540
I'm gonna have available and I'm going
to make every one of them buttons and

656
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:48,550
to make every one of them buttons and
 

657
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,050
to make every one of them buttons and
the idea is that help whatever whatever

658
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:52,060
the idea is that help whatever whatever
 

659
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,000
the idea is that help whatever whatever
you get to if you push that top

660
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,010
you get to if you push that top
 

661
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,550
you get to if you push that top
left-hand button no matter what it will

662
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
left-hand button no matter what it will
 

663
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,650
left-hand button no matter what it will
take you back either one level or back

664
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:58,660
take you back either one level or back
 

665
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,050
take you back either one level or back
to the clock face so can you get to a

666
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,060
to the clock face so can you get to a
 

667
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,300
to the clock face so can you get to a
known you get to a known place every

668
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,310
known you get to a known place every
 

669
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,920
known you get to a known place every
single time and I kind of like that idea

670
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:06,930
single time and I kind of like that idea
 

671
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,600
single time and I kind of like that idea
either using a long press on the clock

672
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:09,610
either using a long press on the clock
 

673
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:14,820
either using a long press on the clock
face will send it into the settings into

674
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:14,830
face will send it into the settings into
 

675
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,450
face will send it into the settings into
the adjust time dialog and then my plan

676
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:18,460
the adjust time dialog and then my plan
 

677
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
the adjust time dialog and then my plan
is it will just show our minute second

678
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,470
is it will just show our minute second
 

679
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,470
is it will just show our minute second
with up and down arrows on each one and

680
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
with up and down arrows on each one and
 

681
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,850
with up and down arrows on each one and
you just click click click click click

682
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:23,860
you just click click click click click
 

683
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,410
you just click click click click click
click click click click whatever one you

684
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:25,420
click click click click whatever one you
 

685
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,510
click click click click whatever one you
want this is great you're doing all the

686
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
want this is great you're doing all the
 

687
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,400
want this is great you're doing all the
work for us

688
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,410
work for us
 

689
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,840
work for us
we can just we can just order our pine

690
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:30,850
we can just we can just order our pine
 

691
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,750
we can just we can just order our pine
time and make it go very first thing I

692
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:36,760
time and make it go very first thing I
 

693
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,570
time and make it go very first thing I
want to do is I want to order all the

694
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:39,580
want to do is I want to order all the
 

695
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,420
want to do is I want to order all the
functions that the existing at the close

696
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,430
functions that the existing at the close
 

697
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,790
functions that the existing at the close
source and claims that it can

698
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:44,800
source and claims that it can
 

699
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,250
source and claims that it can
yeah and it possible even test to see

700
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:47,260
yeah and it possible even test to see
 

701
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,070
yeah and it possible even test to see
how they compare against the smartband

702
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
how they compare against the smartband
 

703
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,020
how they compare against the smartband
and see what the readings are get on the

704
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,030
and see what the readings are get on the
 

705
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,240
and see what the readings are get on the
smartband versus the readings on the

706
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,250
smartband versus the readings on the
 

707
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,950
smartband versus the readings on the
poem and see if they're even in the

708
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:55,960
poem and see if they're even in the
 

709
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,980
poem and see if they're even in the
ballpark right and if I can do that

710
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:58,990
ballpark right and if I can do that
 

711
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,230
ballpark right and if I can do that
I know it's possible even if I don't

712
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,240
I know it's possible even if I don't
 

713
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,030
I know it's possible even if I don't
know how to do it yet but I know it's

714
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,040
know how to do it yet but I know it's
 

715
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,180
know how to do it yet but I know it's
possible so ultimately my plan is to

716
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,190
possible so ultimately my plan is to
 

717
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,430
possible so ultimately my plan is to
just cycle through using those left

718
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:08,440
just cycle through using those left
 

719
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,380
just cycle through using those left
right buttons to cycle through each of

720
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,390
right buttons to cycle through each of
 

721
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,760
right buttons to cycle through each of
the functions rockface initially steps

722
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:13,770
the functions rockface initially steps
 

723
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,980
the functions rockface initially steps
blood pressure heart rate you know all

724
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:16,990
blood pressure heart rate you know all
 

725
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,770
blood pressure heart rate you know all
that fun stuff and see if I can't see if

726
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:19,780
that fun stuff and see if I can't see if
 

727
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,250
that fun stuff and see if I can't see if
I can't duplicate that functionality so

728
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,260
I can't duplicate that functionality so
 

729
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,720
I can't duplicate that functionality so
the difference is it's not phoning home

730
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:24,730
the difference is it's not phoning home
 

731
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:32,340
the difference is it's not phoning home
to China I mean anyone yeah it'll just

732
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,350
to China I mean anyone yeah it'll just
 

733
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,320
to China I mean anyone yeah it'll just
store it locally in memory until it gets

734
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,330
store it locally in memory until it gets
 

735
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,930
store it locally in memory until it gets
a chance to synchronize it to your

736
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:36,940
a chance to synchronize it to your
 

737
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,820
a chance to synchronize it to your
Android phone or your pine phone or

738
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:38,830
Android phone or your pine phone or
 

739
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,860
Android phone or your pine phone or
whatever it is you've got that yep it's

740
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:43,870
whatever it is you've got that yep it's
 

741
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:55,020
whatever it is you've got that yep it's
my data yeah that's great bp9 sounds

742
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,030
my data yeah that's great bp9 sounds
 

743
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,310
my data yeah that's great bp9 sounds
like you got it all planned out so it's

744
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,320
like you got it all planned out so it's
 

745
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,480
