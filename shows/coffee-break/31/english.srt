bit this is the one flaw of zoom there's
an ever so slight delay so those who are

262
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
an ever so slight delay so those who are
 

263
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,740
an ever so slight delay so those who are
watching on demand just think that we're

because there's that ever so slight
 

269
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,410
because there's that ever so slight
delay it takes a moment and then we both

270
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:37,420
delay it takes a moment and then we both
 

271
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,630
delay it takes a moment and then we both
stop and then we both think okay well

against the the GTA API then you compile
it on Windows it will translate directly

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,020
it on Windows it will translate directly
 

781
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,550
it on Windows it will translate directly
to the windows API if you compile it on

782
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:22,560
to the windows API if you compile it on
 

783
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,490
to the windows API if you compile it on
Linux it will translate directly to the

784
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:25,500
Linux it will translate directly to the
 

785
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,960
Linux it will translate directly to the
to the X Windows the library will do all

786
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:29,970
to the X Windows the library will do all
 

787
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,830
to the X Windows the library will do all
that for you

788
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:30,840
that for you
 

789
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,800
that for you
yeah what is only what they did they did

790
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:33,810
yeah what is only what they did they did
 

791
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,350
yeah what is only what they did they did
you date and I'm the big bad though can

792
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,360
you date and I'm the big bad though can
 

793
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,160
you date and I'm the big bad though can
you do that game yeah GG for golf team

794
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,170
you do that game yeah GG for golf team
 

795
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,060
you do that game yeah GG for golf team
tengo que for kylo is that graphic

796
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,070
tengo que for kylo is that graphic
 

797
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,360
tengo que for kylo is that graphic
toolkit I think so it's it's a good idea

798
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,370
toolkit I think so it's it's a good idea
 

799
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:58,159
toolkit I think so it's it's a good idea
to gnome toolkit yeah right okay

800
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:58,169

 

801
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:00,560

where they've now I don't know if you're

802
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:00,570
where they've now I don't know if you're
 

803
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,009
where they've now I don't know if you're
gonna find Pascal bindings for it you're

804
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:04,019
gonna find Pascal bindings for it you're
 

805
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:07,879
gonna find Pascal bindings for it you're
opening a can of worms here but I just

806
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:07,889
opening a can of worms here but I just
 

807
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:13,519
opening a can of worms here but I just
go on google and type GTL yes you're

808
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:13,529
go on google and type GTL yes you're
 

809
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,529
go on google and type GTL yes you're
gonna find you're gonna find see you

810
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:15,539
gonna find you're gonna find see you
 

811
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,560
gonna find you're gonna find see you
gotta find C++ you're gonna find c-sharp

812
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,570
gotta find C++ you're gonna find c-sharp
 

813
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:24,789
gotta find C++ you're gonna find c-sharp
I think you're gonna find Java PHP I

814
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
I think you're gonna find Java PHP I
 

815
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:38,599
I think you're gonna find Java PHP I
can't make PHP beep though bp9 you are

816
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:38,609
can't make PHP beep though bp9 you are
 

817
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,919
can't make PHP beep though bp9 you are
bang on when it comes to programming

818
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:39,929
bang on when it comes to programming
 

819
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,349
bang on when it comes to programming
like it's like your project with the

820
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:42,359
like it's like your project with the
 

821
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,039
like it's like your project with the
pine time my project with NEMS Linux for

822
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:46,049
pine time my project with NEMS Linux for
 

823
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:48,710
pine time my project with NEMS Linux for
example I like it's a motivator when you

824
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
example I like it's a motivator when you
 

825
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,229
example I like it's a motivator when you
have like an end game you know that your

826
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:51,239
have like an end game you know that your
 

827
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,789
have like an end game you know that your
pine time is going to arrive and then

828
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
pine time is going to arrive and then
 

829
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,930
pine time is going to arrive and then
you're going to be able to compile and

830
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:53,940
you're going to be able to compile and
 

831
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,519
you're going to be able to compile and
test this thing out so it's like you've

832
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:55,529
test this thing out so it's like you've
 

833
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,340
test this thing out so it's like you've
got a reason to be doing this and I like

834
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,350
got a reason to be doing this and I like
 

835
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,139
got a reason to be doing this and I like
an end result that you can say I've

836
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:00,149
an end result that you can say I've
 

837
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:02,450
an end result that you can say I've
achieved this with names the same thing

838
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:02,460
achieved this with names the same thing
 

839
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,310
achieved this with names the same thing
like I do all kinds of stuff with MEMS

840
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
like I do all kinds of stuff with MEMS
 

841
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,009
like I do all kinds of stuff with MEMS
and I have like I feel like there's

842
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:07,019
and I have like I feel like there's
 

843
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:09,229
and I have like I feel like there's
achievements along the way so so Peter

844
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:09,239
achievements along the way so so Peter
 

845
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,789
achievements along the way so so Peter
it's a good idea what you're at this

846
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
it's a good idea what you're at this
 

847
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,950
it's a good idea what you're at this
game yeah you've got this game in your

848
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
game yeah you've got this game in your
 

849
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,139
game yeah you've got this game in your
programming and you just keep chipping

850
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:15,149
programming and you just keep chipping
 

851
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,320
programming and you just keep chipping
away and plug away at each issue that

852
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,330
away and plug away at each issue that
 

853
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,570
away and plug away at each issue that
arises and if it doesn't you know if the

854
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:20,580
arises and if it doesn't you know if the
 

855
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,249
arises and if it doesn't you know if the
library doesn't work on Linux then just

856
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:22,259
library doesn't work on Linux then just
 

857
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:24,919
library doesn't work on Linux then just
work around it or make it so that maybe

858
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:24,929
work around it or make it so that maybe
 

859
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:26,840
work around it or make it so that maybe
it's a visual representation instead of

860
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:26,850
it's a visual representation instead of
 

861
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:38,239
it's a visual representation instead of
an audible it took me 10 years to

862
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:38,249
an audible it took me 10 years to
 

863
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:44,389
an audible it took me 10 years to
finally settle on gtk I tried w WX gtk I

864
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:44,399
finally settle on gtk I tried w WX gtk I
 

865
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:50,180
finally settle on gtk I tried w WX gtk I
tried FL TK I tried W X Windows I think

866
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,190
tried FL TK I tried W X Windows I think
 

867
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,349
tried FL TK I tried W X Windows I think
it was and I finally settled on JDK

868
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:53,359
it was and I finally settled on JDK
 

869
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,180
it was and I finally settled on JDK
there were there were there were things

870
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,190
there were there were there were things
 

871
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,859
there were there were there were things
I was trying to do that I just could not

872
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:57,869
I was trying to do that I just could not
 

873
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,599
I was trying to do that I just could not
do in the other tool kits but I was able

874
00:21:59,599 --> 00:21:59,609
do in the other tool kits but I was able
 

875
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,869
do in the other tool kits but I was able
to do in GG case so ok is pretty

876
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:02,879
to do in GG case so ok is pretty
 

877
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,789
to do in GG case so ok is pretty
universal to like it's it's everywhere

878
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
universal to like it's it's everywhere
 

879
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,299
universal to like it's it's everywhere
so you're not gonna have I'm on I'm on

880
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:08,309
so you're not gonna have I'm on I'm on
 

881
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,129
so you're not gonna have I'm on I'm on
GT k2 right now

882
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:10,139
GT k2 right now
 

883
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:12,080
GT k2 right now
GT k3 is out I'm not

884
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,090
GT k3 is out I'm not
 

885
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,190
GT k3 is out I'm not
translated my programs to gtk tree and

886
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,200
translated my programs to gtk tree and
 

887
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,130
translated my programs to gtk tree and
one day i'll do that but honestly the

888
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,140
one day i'll do that but honestly the
 

889
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,470
one day i'll do that but honestly the
project I was working on when I built

890
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:21,480
project I was working on when I built
 

891
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,170
project I was working on when I built
this thing is done I don't have to

892
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,180
this thing is done I don't have to
 

893
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,270
this thing is done I don't have to
modify it anymore I can find ways to

894
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,280
modify it anymore I can find ways to
 

895
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,780
modify it anymore I can find ways to
tweak it if I want to but that parts

896
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:29,790
tweak it if I want to but that parts
 

897
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,270
tweak it if I want to but that parts
done now I have a solid groundwork in

898
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:32,280
done now I have a solid groundwork in
 

899
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,090
done now I have a solid groundwork in
order to in order to tackle any other

900
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,100
order to in order to tackle any other
 

901
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,910
order to in order to tackle any other
project like the part time right so yeah

902
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:37,920
project like the part time right so yeah
 

903
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,090
project like the part time right so yeah
I mean there are one program in my life

904
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,100
I mean there are one program in my life
 

905
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,610
I mean there are one program in my life
from the gone up in 96 or something I

906
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:46,620
from the gone up in 96 or something I
 

907
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:52,670
from the gone up in 96 or something I
had an old 286 computer but I I did not

908
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:52,680
had an old 286 computer but I I did not
 

909
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,820
had an old 286 computer but I I did not
know how big the hard drive was watching

910
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:55,830
know how big the hard drive was watching
 

911
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,830
know how big the hard drive was watching
this yeah so I made a program that in in

912
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:00,840
this yeah so I made a program that in in
 

913
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,920
this yeah so I made a program that in in
I got a copy of the turbo Pascal and I

914
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:03,930
I got a copy of the turbo Pascal and I
 

915
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,430
I got a copy of the turbo Pascal and I
remember the little brother over on my

916
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
remember the little brother over on my
 

917
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,580
remember the little brother over on my
friend had a program that I think he had

918
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:10,590
friend had a program that I think he had
 

919
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,370
friend had a program that I think he had
found somewhere

920
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:12,380
found somewhere
 

921
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,350
found somewhere
that showed how much how big the disk

922
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
that showed how much how big the disk
 

923
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,690
that showed how much how big the disk
was and how much free space you had

924
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,700
was and how much free space you had
 

925
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,740
was and how much free space you had
because endorsed you a guest I didn't

926
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,750
because endorsed you a guest I didn't
 

927
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,590
because endorsed you a guest I didn't
find a way to figure out how much free

928
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,600
find a way to figure out how much free
 

929
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
find a way to figure out how much free
space you had you can easily find how

930
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:26,610
space you had you can easily find how
 

931
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,120
space you had you can easily find how
much you used and then calculate how

932
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,130
much you used and then calculate how
 

933
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,560
much you used and then calculate how
much space you have left but that

934
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,570
much space you have left but that
 

935
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,660
much space you have left but that
involves you knowing how big the driver

936
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:32,670
involves you knowing how big the driver
 

937
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:44,990
involves you knowing how big the driver
was so I made I made five had a very

938
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,000
was so I made I made five had a very
 

939
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,980
was so I made I made five had a very
genius help system with all the

940
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:48,990
genius help system with all the
 

941
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,170
genius help system with all the
variables that you could use and then so

942
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:51,180
variables that you could use and then so
 

943
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,240
variables that you could use and then so
make samples of how you used it so I

944
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,250
make samples of how you used it so I
 

945
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,380
make samples of how you used it so I
combined a few things and then I made in

946
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:57,390
combined a few things and then I made in
 

947
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,680
combined a few things and then I made in
green text into lines and the numbers in

948
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:00,690
green text into lines and the numbers in
 

949
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,970
green text into lines and the numbers in
pink blinking as seeing so with that

950
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:04,980
pink blinking as seeing so with that
 

951
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,160
pink blinking as seeing so with that
that comes right back to you had a

952
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,170
that comes right back to you had a
 

953
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,380
that comes right back to you had a
reason to make something and then you

954
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,390
reason to make something and then you
 

955
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,750
reason to make something and then you
created it and you're filling a need and

956
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
created it and you're filling a need and
 

957
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,610
created it and you're filling a need and
I think that's where open-source really

958
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:13,620
I think that's where open-source really
 

959
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,460
I think that's where open-source really
works too is because these needs come up

960
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,470
works too is because these needs come up
 

961
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,530
works too is because these needs come up
and people code for the open source

962
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:18,540
and people code for the open source
 

963
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,780
and people code for the open source
community or for themselves for their

964
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:20,790
community or for themselves for their
 

965
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,670
community or for themselves for their
own needs and then release it to the

966
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:22,680
own needs and then release it to the
 

967
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,139
own needs and then release it to the
open source community

968
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:27,149

 

969
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:31,649

the idea of open softer yeah but I mean

970
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:31,659
the idea of open softer yeah but I mean
 

971
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:35,159
the idea of open softer yeah but I mean
but hey I knew what freer every well so

972
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:35,169
but hey I knew what freer every well so
 

973
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:39,149
but hey I knew what freer every well so
I'm I made I made it out put that it was

974
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:39,159
I'm I made I made it out put that it was
 

975
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,459
I'm I made I made it out put that it was
free right so the idea was that anyone

976
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:41,469
free right so the idea was that anyone
 

977
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:42,989
free right so the idea was that anyone
who got a copy could do what they wanted

978
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:42,999
who got a copy could do what they wanted
 

979
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:47,759
who got a copy could do what they wanted
with it and after I learned what the new

980
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:47,769
with it and after I learned what the new
 

981
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,529
with it and after I learned what the new
project and ADL then I realized it in

982
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:51,539
project and ADL then I realized it in
 

983
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,589
project and ADL then I realized it in
2008 into GPL and now it resides on

984
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:55,599
2008 into GPL and now it resides on

program was Todd that program that I was
 

989
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,339
program was Todd that program that I was
talking about but I was for the pine

990
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:08,349
talking about but I was for the pine
 

991
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:11,549
talking about but I was for the pine
time the pine phone yeah where I was

992
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:11,559
time the pine phone yeah where I was
 

993
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,789
time the pine phone yeah where I was
going to build a server that that that

994
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
going to build a server that that that
 

995
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,560
going to build a server that that that
the phone application could hit call

996
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:16,570
the phone application could hit call
 

997
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,009
the phone application could hit call
against if it wanted to in order to get

998
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:20,019
against if it wanted to in order to get
 

999
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,419

1000
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:24,429
contact details well I finally looked at
 

1001
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:27,389

pointed me to evolution data service I

1020
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:06,489
pointed me to evolution data service I
 

1021
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:09,479
pointed me to evolution data service I
completely evolution about evolution

1022
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:09,489
completely evolution about evolution
 

1023
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:16,139
completely evolution about evolution
evolution is it is a it is a Microsoft

I didn't think it was evolution itself I

1030
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:26,469
I didn't think it was evolution itself I
 

1031
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:28,049
I didn't think it was evolution itself I
think is still okay I haven't really

1032
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:28,059
think is still okay I haven't really
 

1033
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,489
think is still okay I haven't really
looked at it but that's gonna be my next

1034
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:29,499
looked at it but that's gonna be my next
 

1035
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:32,430
looked at it but that's gonna be my next
step before I build this thing I'm gonna

1036
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:32,440
step before I build this thing I'm gonna
 

1037
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,999
step before I build this thing I'm gonna
go hit search steady yeah I'd love to

1038
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:36,009
go hit search steady yeah I'd love to
 

1039
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:37,559
go hit search steady yeah I'd love to
I'd love to know what you find about

1041
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:39,120
I'd love to know what you find about
evolution because I was under the

evolution because I was under the
 

1043
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,580
evolution because I was under the
that evolution was a dead project but it

1044
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:41,590
that evolution was a dead project but it
 

1045
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,020
that evolution was a dead project but it
was a beautiful project yeah but but it

1046
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,030
was a beautiful project yeah but but it
 

1047
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,090
was a beautiful project yeah but but it
it started having trouble a couple years

1048
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,100
it started having trouble a couple years
 

1049
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,810
it started having trouble a couple years

so so we replaced with thin if not

1052
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,150
so so we replaced with thin if not
 

1053
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,510

nothing that's the prop so when you say
 

1055
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,430
nothing that's the prop so when you say
evolution clear up and I'm like is there

1056
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,440
evolution clear up and I'm like is there
 

1057

something are they still doing death no

1058
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:01,630
something are they still doing death no

well like Zimbra Zimbra made a desktop

1060
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:04,780
well like Zimbra Zimbra made a desktop
 

1061
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,430
well like Zimbra Zimbra made a desktop
edition that would allow mappy access

1062
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:08,440

which was probably the best drop-in but

1064
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:11,800
which was probably the best drop-in but
 

1065
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,250
which was probably the best drop-in but
other than that I haven't seen anything

1066

other than that I haven't seen anything
that's really compatible with maps well

1068
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,120
that's really compatible with maps well
 

1069
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,850
that's really compatible with maps well
I haven't haven't researched it yet but

1070
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:17,860
I haven't haven't researched it yet but
 

1071
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,170
I haven't haven't researched it yet but

it's an interesting evolution when it

1076
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:22,930
it's an interesting evolution when it
 

1077
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,380
it's an interesting evolution when it
comes to that kind of tech because

1078
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,390
comes to that kind of tech because
 

1079
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,690
comes to that kind of tech because
because now everyone in the clouds I

1080
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:27,700
because now everyone in the clouds I
 

1081
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,420
because now everyone in the clouds I
mean you seem brighter yeah but you're

1082
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:30,430
mean you seem brighter yeah but you're
 

1083
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,850
mean you seem brighter yeah but you're
using the cloud-based stuff now in a lot

1084
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:32,860
using the cloud-based stuff now in a lot
 

1085
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,310
using the cloud-based stuff now in a lot
of senses but that but if evolution has

1086
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,320

1133
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,650
keep in mind usually I do a single show
every Wednesday and that fills up our

1134
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:34,660
every Wednesday and that fills up our
 

1135
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660

of 20 gigs this I did the math and this

1138
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:40,780
of 20 gigs this I did the math and this
 

1139
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,560
of 20 gigs this I did the math and this
is about eight or nine gigs per week

1140
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:43,570
is about eight or nine gigs per week
 

1141
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,380
is about eight or nine gigs per week
usage so that would push me to the point

1142
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,390
usage so that would push me to the point
 

1143
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,410
