things for the rack so there's the rack
you can see the shelf there with the

72
00:01:59,209 --> 00:01:59,219
you can see the shelf there with the
 

73
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,060
you can see the shelf there with the
mikrotik going you guys can see how like

74
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,070
mikrotik going you guys can see how like
 

75
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,459

now yeah so I got a UPS with a red light
 

85
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,930
now yeah so I got a UPS with a red light
so I got a place batteries and so i

86
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:20,940
so I got a place batteries and so i
 

87
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,390
so I got a place batteries and so i
shimmied the second UPS at the front

88
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,400
shimmied the second UPS at the front
 

89
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,360
shimmied the second UPS at the front
there to give everything power just for

90
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,370
there to give everything power just for
 

91
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,450
there to give everything power just for
the coffee break so that's what we have

92
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:29,460
the coffee break so that's what we have
 

93
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,490
the coffee break so that's what we have
and then a wise cams magnetically on

94
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:31,500
and then a wise cams magnetically on
 

95
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,520
and then a wise cams magnetically on
there so you haven't any fuses or

96
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,530
there so you haven't any fuses or
 

97
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,710
there so you haven't any fuses or
breakers so presumably you're all good

98
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
breakers so presumably you're all good
 

99
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,800
breakers so presumably you're all good
for tomorrow right yeah but I did have a

100
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:39,810
for tomorrow right yeah but I did have a
 

101
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,250
for tomorrow right yeah but I did have a
power flash today which would I think

102
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,260
power flash today which would I think
 

103
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,360
power flash today which would I think
because there's a like a windstorm

104
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,370
because there's a like a windstorm
 

105
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,130
because there's a like a windstorm
outside so that happened and it was a

106
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,140
outside so that happened and it was a
 

107
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,420
outside so that happened and it was a
bit of a wake-up call because that

108
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:50,430
bit of a wake-up call because that
 

109
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,740
bit of a wake-up call because that
tripped the the crummy old UPS so that's

110
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:54,750
tripped the the crummy old UPS so that's
 

111
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,650
tripped the the crummy old UPS so that's
why I had me over this big one so I got

112
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:57,660
why I had me over this big one so I got
 

113
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,120
why I had me over this big one so I got
to buy new batteries but you know how it

114
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,130
to buy new batteries but you know how it
 

115
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,470
to buy new batteries but you know how it
is it's like the batteries themselves

116
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
is it's like the batteries themselves
 

117
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:12,170
is it's like the batteries themselves
are pretty expensive so no yeah I'm

118
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,180
are pretty expensive so no yeah I'm
 

119
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,150

Robbie because I want to talk to you
about replacing those GPS batteries yeah

124
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:19,320
about replacing those GPS batteries yeah
 

125
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,540
about replacing those GPS batteries yeah
same boat oh yes well I'm fortunate bp9

126
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:23,550
same boat oh yes well I'm fortunate bp9
 

127
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,210
same boat oh yes well I'm fortunate bp9
that the place that I work at I

128
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,220
that the place that I work at I
 

129
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,220
that the place that I work at I
mentioned it before but they they

130
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,230
mentioned it before but they they
 

131
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,070
mentioned it before but they they
refurbish the the battery electable they

132
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,080
refurbish the the battery electable they
 

133
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,410
refurbish the the battery electable they
don't refurbish the batteries they they

134
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,420
don't refurbish the batteries they they
 

135
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,390
don't refurbish the batteries they they
buy in new batteries and then they

136
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,400
buy in new batteries and then they
 

137
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,450
buy in new batteries and then they
replace the batteries in the UPS's so

138
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:38,460
replace the batteries in the UPS's so
 

139
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,460
replace the batteries in the UPS's so
and that's a pretty common practice so I

140
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:40,470
and that's a pretty common practice so I
 

141
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,500
and that's a pretty common practice so I
think we actually have stock right now

142
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,510
think we actually have stock right now
 

143
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,600
think we actually have stock right now
which would be perfect because it's not

144
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:44,610
which would be perfect because it's not
 

145
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,340
which would be perfect because it's not
a good time to try to get batteries

146
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,350
a good time to try to get batteries
 

147
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,600
a good time to try to get batteries
across the border so I can actually take

148
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:50,610
across the border so I can actually take
 

149
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,490
across the border so I can actually take
that in and get new batteries put in but

150
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:52,500
that in and get new batteries put in but
 

151
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,100
that in and get new batteries put in but
that my 1500 volt amp is going to take

152
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,110
that my 1500 volt amp is going to take
 

153
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,820
that my 1500 volt amp is going to take
two 12-volt batteries and each one of

154
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:58,830
two 12-volt batteries and each one of
 

155
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,410
two 12-volt batteries and each one of
those retail for like 110 bucks so so

156
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,420
those retail for like 110 bucks so so

batteries do you know no I don't

170
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:25,480
batteries do you know no I don't
 

171
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,080
batteries do you know no I don't
no I haven't that's not my department I

172
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,090
no I haven't that's not my department I
 

173
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,300
no I haven't that's not my department I
actually take it in and open a work

174
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,310
actually take it in and open a work
 

175
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,210
actually take it in and open a work
order and then take it away fixed okay

176
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,220
order and then take it away fixed okay
 

177
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,130
order and then take it away fixed okay
that's how it works but as I'm saying

178
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,140
that's how it works but as I'm saying
 

179
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,280
that's how it works but as I'm saying
it's like it's such a topic because I'm

180
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,290
it's like it's such a topic because I'm
 

181
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,440
it's like it's such a topic because I'm
I'm like very much of the mindset where

182
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,450
I'm like very much of the mindset where
 

183
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm like very much of the mindset where
I'd rather fixed up and rather keep

184
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,310
I'd rather fixed up and rather keep
 

185
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,610
I'd rather fixed up and rather keep
things going but when the cost to

186
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:47,620
things going but when the cost to
 

187
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,250
things going but when the cost to
service it is almost as high as buying a

188
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,260
service it is almost as high as buying a
 

189
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,920
service it is almost as high as buying a
nice rack mount unit it's like you just

190
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:52,930
nice rack mount unit it's like you just
 

191
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,230
nice rack mount unit it's like you just
start to think and I know when a PC is

192
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,240
start to think and I know when a PC is
 

193
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,510
start to think and I know when a PC is
better than than a trip light but right

194
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
better than than a trip light but right
 

195
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,940
better than than a trip light but right
you start to think is that maybe the

196
00:04:59,940 --> 00:04:59,950
you start to think is that maybe the
 

197
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,980
you start to think is that maybe the
route I should go so but yeah I'll make

198
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,990
route I should go so but yeah I'll make
 

199
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,820
route I should go so but yeah I'll make
that decision in the next couple of days

200
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:07,830
that decision in the next couple of days
 

201
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,850
that decision in the next couple of days
the things I have to deal with but yeah

202
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:11,860
the things I have to deal with but yeah
 

203
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,510
the things I have to deal with but yeah
each each they're pretty Universal the

204
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
each each they're pretty Universal the
 

205
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,080
each each they're pretty Universal the
batteries okay well what I think I'll do

206
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,090
batteries okay well what I think I'll do
 

207
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,740
batteries okay well what I think I'll do
is do some research on the interwebs and

208
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:21,750
is do some research on the interwebs and
 

209
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,030
is do some research on the interwebs and
as I said many many episodes ago I have

210
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,040
as I said many many episodes ago I have
 

211
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,430
as I said many many episodes ago I have
a few ups that need to that I just need

212
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:32,440
a few ups that need to that I just need
 

213
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,010
a few ups that need to that I just need
to replace the battery one the UPS is

214
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,020
to replace the battery one the UPS is
 

215
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,960
to replace the battery one the UPS is
working just fine if the battery was in

216
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:36,970
working just fine if the battery was in
 

217
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,100
working just fine if the battery was in

I don't recall the smaller ones like

220
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,310
I don't recall the smaller ones like
 

221
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,280
I don't recall the smaller ones like
I've got a 1000 volt lamp that will take

222
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,290
I've got a 1000 volt lamp that will take
 

223
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,980
I've got a 1000 volt lamp that will take
one battery yes 1500 volt amp takes two

224
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:51,990
one battery yes 1500 volt amp takes two
 

225
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,450
one battery yes 1500 volt amp takes two
so mine must be even smaller than 650

226
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:57,460
so mine must be even smaller than 650
 

227
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,010
so mine must be even smaller than 650
yeah rings a bell

228
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,020
yeah rings a bell
 

229
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,070
yeah rings a bell
just take one 12-volt battery yeah yeah

230
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
just take one 12-volt battery yeah yeah
 

231
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,050
just take one 12-volt battery yeah yeah
yeah they're pretty they're pretty easy

232
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,060
yeah they're pretty they're pretty easy
 

233

bp9 anyone who's considering replacing
the batteries and I did mention this on

238
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:10,780
the batteries and I did mention this on
 

239
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,690
the batteries and I did mention this on
a previous coffee break but I'll warn

240
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:12,700
a previous coffee break but I'll warn
 

241
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,150
a previous coffee break but I'll warn
you when you see the batteries are

242
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,160
you when you see the batteries are
 

243
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,670
you when you see the batteries are
available like a cheap version and an

244
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
available like a cheap version and an
 

245
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,710
available like a cheap version and an
expensive version I think I made the

246
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:19,720
expensive version I think I made the
 

247
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,500
expensive version I think I made the

for your printer okay when it doesn't

250
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:25,870
for your printer okay when it doesn't
 

251
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,420
for your printer okay when it doesn't
give you more power or anything but what

252
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,430
give you more power or anything but what
 

253
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,130
give you more power or anything but what
it does give you to get the better one

254
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,140
it does give you to get the better one
 

255
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,760
it does give you to get the better one
is longer life as far as how long will

256
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:32,770
is longer life as far as how long will
 

257
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,380

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,390
that last in your ups point where you
 

259
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,480
that last in your ups point where you
have to replace it so no good battery

260
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,490
have to replace it so no good battery
 

261
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,240
have to replace it so no good battery
they say we'll give you three years

262
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,250
they say we'll give you three years
 

263

yep realistically I could probably pull

264
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:42,730
yep realistically I could probably pull
 

265
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,110
yep realistically I could probably pull
five years out of that okay a cheap

266
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,120
five years out of that okay a cheap
 

267
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,870
five years out of that okay a cheap
battery I have put cheap batteries in my

268
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
battery I have put cheap batteries in my
 

269
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,540
battery I have put cheap batteries in my
UPS as before as well they're exactly

270
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,550
UPS as before as well they're exactly
 

271
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,340
UPS as before as well they're exactly
the same voltage exactly the same

272
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,350
the same voltage exactly the same
 

273
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,890
the same voltage exactly the same
amperage but they're cheaper like

274
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:55,900
amperage but they're cheaper like
 

275
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,930
amperage but they're cheaper like
they're like $20 cheaper for the battery

276
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:57,940
they're like $20 cheaper for the battery
 

277
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,970
they're like $20 cheaper for the battery
and they'll last a year and then I've

278
00:06:59,970 --> 00:06:59,980
and they'll last a year and then I've
 

279
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,040
and they'll last a year and then I've
got to replace them so it's just not

280
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,050
got to replace them so it's just not
 

281
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,910
got to replace them so it's just not
worth it I remember last year when I was

282
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:04,920
worth it I remember last year when I was
 

283
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,550
worth it I remember last year when I was
or the year before when I would needed

284
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560

 

285
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,050

replacement I yes I have a on a PC year

286
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,060

trying to figure out is it worth buying

298
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
trying to figure out is it worth buying
 

299
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,860
trying to figure out is it worth buying
a new battery or should I just go ahead

300
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:46,870
a new battery or should I just go ahead
 

301
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,070
a new battery or should I just go ahead
and and I just buy another UPS I really

302
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
and and I just buy another UPS I really
 

303
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,930
and and I just buy another UPS I really
hate to just go buy another UPS because

304
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:51,940
hate to just go buy another UPS because
 

305

I'm stepping up like like cords of wood

306
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
I'm stepping up like like cords of wood
 

307
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,380
I'm stepping up like like cords of wood
that's the thing too is it will be

308
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,390

some testing certainly 128 you're gonna

some testing certainly 128 you're gonna
 

731
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,610
some testing certainly 128 you're gonna
hear it

732
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:12,620
hear it
 

733
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,160
hear it
128 you'll hear it but I was in 2007 I I

734
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,170
128 you'll hear it but I was in 2007 I I

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,230
128 you'll hear it but I was in 2007 I I
decided with my CD collection I remember

736
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:23,240
decided with my CD collection I remember

I use the week and I did nothing but see

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,230
I use the week and I did nothing but see
this

740
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
this
 

741
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,890
this
and before that I have done some testing

742
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:29,900
and before that I have done some testing
 

743
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,850
and before that I have done some testing
and I hear the difference between our

744
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:33,860
and I hear the difference between our
 

745
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:41,560
and I hear the difference between our
128 kilobits and 196 anything above 196

746
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:41,570
128 kilobits and 196 anything above 196
 

747
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,990
128 kilobits and 196 anything above 196
I don't hear any difference so I

748
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't hear any difference so I
 

749
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,410
I don't hear any difference so I
personally am i settled on 196 because

750
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:50,420
personally am i settled on 196 because
 

751
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,350
personally am i settled on 196 because
of a lower file size yeah you mean you

752
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
of a lower file size yeah you mean you
 

753
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,470
of a lower file size yeah you mean you
don't hear any difference in the 196

754
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
don't hear any difference in the 196
 

755
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,540
don't hear any difference in the 196
kilohertz and the original source is

757
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,560

that 100 yeah okay see for me I like

758
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,570
that 100 yeah okay see for me I like
 

759
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,710
that 100 yeah okay see for me I like
because data storage is so cheap these

760
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:05,720
because data storage is so cheap these
 

761
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,620
because data storage is so cheap these
days I opted for 320 just because that's

762
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:08,630
days I opted for 320 just because that's
 

763
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,450
days I opted for 320 just because that's
the closest you can get the lossless

you're probably not going to notice a

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,120
you're probably not going to notice a
