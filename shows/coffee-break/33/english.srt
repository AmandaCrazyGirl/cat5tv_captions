actually Ross like you would think up on

102
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,320
actually Ross like you would think up on
 

103
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,780
actually Ross like you would think up on
the left-hand side of the country right

104
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:33,790
the left-hand side of the country right
 

105
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,259
the left-hand side of the country right
on the left hand side yes that's like

106
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:40,269
on the left hand side yes that's like
 

107
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,030
on the left hand side yes that's like
the left side and the right side the

108
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
the left side and the right side the
 

109
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,930
the left side and the right side the
left coast of the right coast right so

110
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:45,940
left coast of the right coast right so
 

111
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,400
left coast of the right coast right so
it makes sense that they would send it

112
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,410
it makes sense that they would send it
 

113
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,520
it makes sense that they would send it
up the west coast right realistically if

114
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,530
up the west coast right realistically if
 

115
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,680
up the west coast right realistically if
you look at a map as as the crow flies

you look at a map as as the crow flies
 

117
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,990
you look at a map as as the crow flies
it would make a lot more sense to just

118
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,000
it would make a lot more sense to just
 

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,670
it would make a lot more sense to just
ship it directly you sure you know up

120
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:56,680
ship it directly you sure you know up
 

121
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,190
ship it directly you sure you know up
through New York and into that that's

122
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
through New York and into that that's
 

123
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,949
through New York and into that that's
not how transit works have you been on a

anything but in Linux and UNIX system
 

531
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:39,269
anything but in Linux and UNIX system
that is there with the system workshop

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
that is there with the system workshop
 

533
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,980
that is there with the system workshop
very often that is the only thing that

534

very often that is the only thing that
 

535

very often that is the only thing that
it's saving the file system indicator

00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:56,529
eternity would be to the power and the
 

539
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,680
eternity would be to the power and the
key on the keyboard have to be in in the

540
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:58,690
key on the keyboard have to be in in the
 

541
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,639
key on the keyboard have to be in in the
normal place yeah see those of you who

542
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:02,649
normal place yeah see those of you who
 

543
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:05,519
normal place yeah see those of you who
have watched my original pine one review

544
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:05,529
have watched my original pine one review
 

545
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,949
have watched my original pine one review
you know that I need the keys to be in

546
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:07,959
you know that I need the keys to be in
 

547
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:17,730
you know that I need the keys to be in
the right place you know I think they

548
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:17,740
the right place you know I think they
 

549
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,389
the right place you know I think they
did a huge blunder some 5 or 10 years

550
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
did a huge blunder some 5 or 10 years
 

551
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:30,449
did a huge blunder some 5 or 10 years
ago where the lower case they set X CV

552
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:30,459
ago where the lower case they set X CV
 

553
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:33,360
ago where the lower case they set X CV
and so on and they had they added a new

554
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,370
and so on and they had they added a new
 

555
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,559
and so on and they had they added a new
key on that row the way they sold it was

556
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:37,569
key on that row the way they sold it was
 

557
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:41,850
key on that row the way they sold it was
then the shifted all key is trying to

558
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:41,860
then the shifted all key is trying to
 

559
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:49,319
then the shifted all key is trying to
create a 27th letter new function and

560
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:49,329
create a 27th letter new function and
 

561
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:53,400
create a 27th letter new function and
they added it in it was already occupied

562
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,410
they added it in it was already occupied
 

563
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,720
they added it in it was already occupied
so they shifted BLTs a 1 here 2 to 2

564
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:57,730
so they shifted BLTs a 1 here 2 to 2
 

565
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,400
so they shifted BLTs a 1 here 2 to 2
right

566
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,410
right
 

567
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:08,100
right
and I remember reading and one of the

568
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,110
and I remember reading and one of the
 

569
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,299
and I remember reading and one of the
commenter's had one of those a laptop

570
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:12,309
commenter's had one of those a laptop
 

571
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,220

demonstrate how how stupid they did the
 

575
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,720
demonstrate how how stupid they did the
key keyboard was here and so he wrote

576
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:20,730
key keyboard was here and so he wrote
 

577
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,480
key keyboard was here and so he wrote
without looking and the sentence

578
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:25,490
without looking and the sentence
 

579
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,390

the computer just shut down on me I did

726
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:56,350
the computer just shut down on me I did
 

727
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:02,549
the computer just shut down on me I did
not know what and that next time ten

728
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
not know what and that next time ten
 

729
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,789
not know what and that next time ten
minutes later sure enough it and then we

730
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:05,799
minutes later sure enough it and then we
 

731
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,859
minutes later sure enough it and then we
notice that his kidnapper sitting on his

732
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:07,869
notice that his kidnapper sitting on his
 

733
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:23,729
notice that his kidnapper sitting on his
lap had his finger down on the yeah

lap had his finger down on the yeah
 

735
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,349
lap had his finger down on the yeah
usually if I've seen a computer that

736
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:25,359
usually if I've seen a computer that
 

737
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,899
usually if I've seen a computer that
will reboot itself or turn itself off

738
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:27,909
will reboot itself or turn itself off
 

739
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:30,269
will reboot itself or turn itself off
it's gonna be either the CPU paste has

740
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:30,279
it's gonna be either the CPU paste has
 

741
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,279
it's gonna be either the CPU paste has
gone bad or the CPU cooling in some way

742
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:32,289
gone bad or the CPU cooling in some way
 

743
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,169
gone bad or the CPU cooling in some way
that's what I think has happened my

744
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:34,179
that's what I think has happened my
 

745
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,320
that's what I think has happened my
rosemary hi beau yeah so if it's

746
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,330
rosemary hi beau yeah so if it's
 

747
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,849
rosemary hi beau yeah so if it's
overheating it's gonna turn itself off

748
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:38,859
overheating it's gonna turn itself off
 

749
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,440
overheating it's gonna turn itself off
in order to prevent the amateurs at the

750
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,450
in order to prevent the amateurs at the
 

751
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,019
in order to prevent the amateurs at the
CP yep so I've got some fresh I've got

752
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:43,029
CP yep so I've got some fresh I've got
 

753
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,820
CP yep so I've got some fresh I've got
some fresh thermal paste now and I'm

754
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:44,830
some fresh thermal paste now and I'm
 

755
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,129
some fresh thermal paste now and I'm
gonna try reattaching that the cooler I

756
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:47,139
gonna try reattaching that the cooler I
 

757
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:48,899
gonna try reattaching that the cooler I
did notice when I took the cooler off

758
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:48,909
did notice when I took the cooler off
 

759
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,869
did notice when I took the cooler off
the CPU the thermal paste had all dried

760
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:51,879
the CPU the thermal paste had all dried
 

761
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:55,259
the CPU the thermal paste had all dried
up it was all there yeah so I I agree

762
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:55,269
up it was all there yeah so I I agree
 

763
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:56,789
up it was all there yeah so I I agree
with you I think that's what the problem

764
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
with you I think that's what the problem
 

765
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,960
with you I think that's what the problem
was but I don't know if that will

766
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:57,970
was but I don't know if that will
 

767
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,909
was but I don't know if that will
finally solve it so here's hoping

768
00:22:59,909 --> 00:22:59,919
finally solve it so here's hoping
 

769
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,379
finally solve it so here's hoping
here's hopefully you know what else is

770
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:01,389
here's hopefully you know what else is
 

771
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:03,989
here's hopefully you know what else is
you never think of it necessarily and

772
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:03,999
you never think of it necessarily and
 

773
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:05,489
you never think of it necessarily and
certainly consumers don't necessarily

774
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:05,499
certainly consumers don't necessarily
 

775
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:07,710
certainly consumers don't necessarily
think of it but with that problem it

776
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:07,720
think of it but with that problem it
 

777
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,840
think of it but with that problem it
could be just as simple as dust buildup

778
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:09,850
could be just as simple as dust buildup
 

779
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,899
could be just as simple as dust buildup
