limitations of the half-hour segments
 

229
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,870
limitations of the half-hour segments
and and we do have very strict criteria

thing that another part of the criteria
 

235
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,370
thing that another part of the criteria
is that we do story bedding as well so I

236
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:13,380
is that we do story bedding as well so I
 

237
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,620
is that we do story bedding as well so I
think there was one time when a story

238
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:15,630
think there was one time when a story
 

239
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,230
think there was one time when a story
got through that was a little on the

240
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
got through that was a little on the
 

241
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,200
got through that was a little on the
fence whether it was true or not and and

242
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,210
fence whether it was true or not and and
 

243
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,750
fence whether it was true or not and and
so we've we've established if I can't

244
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:23,760
so we've we've established if I can't
 

245
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,200
so we've we've established if I can't
find three sources that are independent

246
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,210
find three sources that are independent
 

247

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,530
there are ten other people saying this
 

291
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,830
there are ten other people saying this
but then you realize that it's the exact

292
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
but then you realize that it's the exact
 

293
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,950
but then you realize that it's the exact
same verbatim verbage yes just rumors in

294
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:55,960
same verbatim verbage yes just rumors in
 

295
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,410
same verbatim verbage yes just rumors in
the same source yeah and so there's

296
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:58,420
the same source yeah and so there's
 

297
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,510
the same source yeah and so there's
still only one source even though we

298
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:00,520
still only one source even though we
 

299
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,150
still only one source even though we
found 10 other copies that same thang

300
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,160
found 10 other copies that same thang
 

301

00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:15,309
from and and how does the publisher of
 

511
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,249
from and and how does the publisher of
the open source make any money on it and

512
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:17,259
the open source make any money on it and
 

513
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,069
the open source make any money on it and

you're doing it at home again this is
 

593
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,029
you're doing it at home again this is
what's not clear with that particular

594
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:43,039
what's not clear with that particular
 

595
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,500
what's not clear with that particular
thing this is

596
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:46,510
thing this is
 

597
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,480

a Russian law so they had it works a
 

599
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,770
a Russian law so they had it works a
little bit different area and that is

600
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:52,780
little bit different area and that is
 

601
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,510
little bit different area and that is
part of the problem is that they have a

602
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:57,520
part of the problem is that they have a
 

603
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,820
part of the problem is that they have a
different law regarding that and they

604
00:16:59,820 --> 00:16:59,830
different law regarding that and they
 

605
