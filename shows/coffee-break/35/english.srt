we had to come into our own and then it
 

61
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,050
we had to come into our own and then it
it suddenly clicks and you because

62
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,060
it suddenly clicks and you because
 

63
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,310
it suddenly clicks and you because
you've been doing it every single week

64
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,320
you've been doing it every single week
 

65
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,580
you've been doing it every single week
for 13 years you're able to think much

66
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:46,590
for 13 years you're able to think much
 

67
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,710
for 13 years you're able to think much
more on the fly and able to pick up I

68
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
more on the fly and able to pick up I
 

69
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,330
more on the fly and able to pick up I
think also when you stumble over your

70
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,340
think also when you stumble over your
 

71
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,969
think also when you stumble over your
words but not that you did obviously not

72
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:52,979
words but not that you did obviously not
 

73
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,609
words but not that you did obviously not
what I mean is thinking along the terms

74
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:55,619
what I mean is thinking along the terms
 

75
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,380
what I mean is thinking along the terms
of it's hard you you learn as you

76
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:00,390
of it's hard you you learn as you
 

77
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,760
of it's hard you you learn as you
stumble over your words how to recover

78
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:01,770
stumble over your words how to recover
 

79
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,940
stumble over your words how to recover
from that in a way that makes sense to

80
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:04,950
from that in a way that makes sense to
 

81

from that in a way that makes sense to
the conversation yeah so you know and

you all were talking about sorry oh okay
 

113
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,490
you all were talking about sorry oh okay
no I'm go back and look again when we

114
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:46,500
no I'm go back and look again when we
 

115
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,660
no I'm go back and look again when we
aired the show live I wasn't able pardon

116
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:50,670
aired the show live I wasn't able pardon
 

117
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,120
aired the show live I wasn't able pardon
me I wasn't able to get them on with

118
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,130
me I wasn't able to get them on with
 

119
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,100
me I wasn't able to get them on with
zoom okay

120
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,110
zoom okay
 

121
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,740
zoom okay
so the intention was to have an

122
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:57,750
so the intention was to have an
 

123
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,650
so the intention was to have an
interactive newsroom as we normally do

124
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:00,660
interactive newsroom as we normally do
 

125
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,130
interactive newsroom as we normally do
but socially distant using zoom didn't

126
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,140
but socially distant using zoom didn't
 

127
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,740
but socially distant using zoom didn't
work out that way so I had to have them

128
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:06,750
work out that way so I had to have them
 

129
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,680
work out that way so I had to have them
after afterward they they recorded I

130
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,690
after afterward they they recorded I
 

131
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,320
after afterward they they recorded I
guess they pre-recorded their segments

132
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,330
guess they pre-recorded their segments
 

133
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,710
guess they pre-recorded their segments
and then sent them to me so then I post

134
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:15,720
and then sent them to me so then I post
 

135
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,110
and then sent them to me so then I post
edited them in and that's because I

136
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,120
edited them in and that's because I
 

137
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,820
edited them in and that's because I
couldn't get it I couldn't get

138
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:19,830
couldn't get it I couldn't get
 

139
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,190
couldn't get it I couldn't get
everything connected in time to make it

140
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,200
everything connected in time to make it
 

141
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,010
everything connected in time to make it
work so what I've done I've created two

142
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,020
work so what I've done I've created two
 

143
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,440
work so what I've done I've created two
Linux Mint virtual machines on my

144
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,450
Linux Mint virtual machines on my
 

145
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,800
Linux Mint virtual machines on my
hypervisor and well I created one and

146
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:30,810
hypervisor and well I created one and
 

147
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,620
hypervisor and well I created one and
then I cloned it so but and so what it

148
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:33,630
then I cloned it so but and so what it
 

149
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,199
then I cloned it so but and so what it
is is it's it's Linux Mint with matei

150
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,209
is is it's it's Linux Mint with matei
 

151
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,690
is is it's it's Linux Mint with matei
desktop and the only app that's

152
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:38,700
desktop and the only app that's
 

153
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,800

installed is zoom ok so then I've got it
 

155
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,290
installed is zoom ok so then I've got it
set so that each one is you know so

156
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:45,300
set so that each one is you know so

virtual machines basically hacking zoom

174
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:12,989
virtual machines basically hacking zoom
 

175
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,840
virtual machines basically hacking zoom
in such a way that it allows me to

176
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:14,850
in such a way that it allows me to
 

177
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,440
in such a way that it allows me to
record two isolated video shots and then

178
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,450
record two isolated video shots and then
 

179
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,990
record two isolated video shots and then
our cameras will be recording me in an

180
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,000
our cameras will be recording me in an
 

181
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,840
our cameras will be recording me in an
isolated video shot so then post Pro set

182
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:23,850
isolated video shot so then post Pro set
 

183
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,840
isolated video shot so then post Pro set
so live you'd see a normal zoom

184
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:26,850
so live you'd see a normal zoom
 

185

oh sweet okay so I got a biscuit which
 

495
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,560
oh sweet okay so I got a biscuit which
is like a nine axis gyro I guess you

496
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:47,570
is like a nine axis gyro I guess you
 

497
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,050
is like a nine axis gyro I guess you
call it it's like a sensor so I don't

498
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,060
call it it's like a sensor so I don't
 

499
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,890
call it it's like a sensor so I don't
create circuits too and these are really

500
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:53,900
create circuits too and these are really
 

501
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,660
create circuits too and these are really
nice because they've got the Arduino

502
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:55,670
nice because they've got the Arduino
 

503
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,090
nice because they've got the Arduino
built right into it you don't have to

504
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,100
built right into it you don't have to
 

505
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,769
built right into it you don't have to
have like a whole bunch of parts it's

506
00:12:59,769 --> 00:12:59,779
have like a whole bunch of parts it's
 

507

you want to do that at runtime not at

574
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,370
you want to do that at runtime not at
 

575
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,490
you want to do that at runtime not at
one you don't need to necessarily do it

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:01,500
one you don't need to necessarily do it
 

577
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,660
one you don't need to necessarily do it
at runtime but isn't it nice that you

578
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:02,670
at runtime but isn't it nice that you
 

579
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,630
at runtime but isn't it nice that you
can see and I haven't even plugged it in

580
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:05,640
can see and I haven't even plugged it in
 

581
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,040
can see and I haven't even plugged it in
yet man I don't know all the features

582
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,050
yet man I don't know all the features
 

583
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,440
yet man I don't know all the features
yet I can't wait to play you can see

584
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,450
yet I can't wait to play you can see
 

585
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,080
yet I can't wait to play you can see
yeah you can monitor everything on it so

586
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,090
yeah you can monitor everything on it so
 

587
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,350
yeah you can monitor everything on it so
you can monitor like the power the

588
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:18,360
you can monitor like the power the
 

589
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,320
you can monitor like the power the
voltage everything like the dry suppose

590
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,330
voltage everything like the dry suppose
 

591
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,000
voltage everything like the dry suppose
so you can do a lot of stuff that you'd

592
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,010
so you can do a lot of stuff that you'd
 

593
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,740
so you can do a lot of stuff that you'd
normally have to use your volt meter for

594
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:24,750
normally have to use your volt meter for
 

595
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,470
normally have to use your volt meter for
or like some kind of inline device to be

596
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,480
or like some kind of inline device to be
 

597
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,820
or like some kind of inline device to be
able to monitor but you do it from your

598
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:28,830
able to monitor but you do it from your
 

599
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,590
able to monitor but you do it from your
phone

600
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600

I'm just cool too long it has your

602
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm just cool too long it has your
 

603
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,740
I'm just cool too long it has your
lightning strikes and then you've got to

604
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:33,750
lightning strikes and then you've got to
 

605
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,590
lightning strikes and then you've got to
replace Oh suddenly your app jumps up to

606
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:36,600
replace Oh suddenly your app jumps up to
 

607
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,260
replace Oh suddenly your app jumps up to
four million and then dies then it has

608
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,270
four million and then dies then it has
 

609
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,720
four million and then dies then it has
an LCD screen that plugs into it too so

610
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:41,730
an LCD screen that plugs into it too so
 

611
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,400
an LCD screen that plugs into it too so
this goes on top and that gives you a

612
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,410
this goes on top and that gives you a
 

613
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,740
this goes on top and that gives you a
readout as well so that'll be fun

614
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:45,750
readout as well so that'll be fun
 

615
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,730
readout as well so that'll be fun
that'll be something I'll show on the

616
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:46,740
that'll be something I'll show on the
 

617
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,630
that'll be something I'll show on the
show yeah I got a piece of plexi which

must have something to do with that it's
 

621
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,750
must have something to do with that it's
about the same size so it must have

622
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:56,760
about the same size so it must have
 

623
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,519
about the same size so it must have
something to do with that board hmm okay

minutes you said did it that was the

730
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:20,650
minutes you said did it that was the
 

731
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:29,940
minutes you said did it that was the
plan but no ended up doing so if you

732
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:29,950
plan but no ended up doing so if you
 

733
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,630
plan but no ended up doing so if you
follow this the minute hand around every

734
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:33,640
follow this the minute hand around every
 

735
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,570
follow this the minute hand around every
time it every time it clicks by the men

736
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:36,580
time it every time it clicks by the men
 

737
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,060
time it every time it clicks by the men
that would be 60 times for every hour

738
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,070
that would be 60 times for every hour
 

739
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,540
that would be 60 times for every hour
right so 60 minutes in every hour and a

740
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:42,550
right so 60 minutes in every hour and a
 

741
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:55,500
right so 60 minutes in every hour and a
half there bp9 yeah in this 12

742
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,510
half there bp9 yeah in this 12
 

743
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,800
half there bp9 yeah in this 12
twelve hours in in one rotation of the

744
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:58,810
twelve hours in in one rotation of the
 

745
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,740
twelve hours in in one rotation of the
our hand right multiplied the two you

746
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:01,750
our hand right multiplied the two you
 

747
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,330
our hand right multiplied the two you
get 720 divide that in half you get 360

748
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,340
get 720 divide that in half you get 360
 

749
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,750
get 720 divide that in half you get 360
there's 360 degrees in the whole thing

750
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:08,760
there's 360 degrees in the whole thing
 

751
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,490
there's 360 degrees in the whole thing
somehow and I haven't I haven't

752
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:11,500
somehow and I haven't I haven't
 

753
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,260
somehow and I haven't I haven't
completely rehearsed it in my head so I

754
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,270
completely rehearsed it in my head so I
 

755
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,060
completely rehearsed it in my head so I
can't explain it completely but it

756
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,070
can't explain it completely but it
 

757
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,850
can't explain it completely but it
worked out somehow that the hour hand

758
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:17,860
worked out somehow that the hour hand
 

759
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,290
worked out somehow that the hour hand
updates every two minutes so the

760
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,300
updates every two minutes so the
 

761
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,240
updates every two minutes so the
position of the hour hand changes every

762
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,250
position of the hour hand changes every
 

763
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,750
position of the hour hand changes every
two minutes more often than that I think

764
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
two minutes more often than that I think
 

765
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,490
two minutes more often than that I think

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,330
watch after time sorry carry on just a
very very quick comment that was with

782
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:53,340
very very quick comment that was with
 

783
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,880
very very quick comment that was with
720 possible possible opportunities to

784
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:56,890
720 possible possible opportunities to
 

785
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,180
720 possible possible opportunities to
update the arrow hand the resolution at

786
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,190
update the arrow hand the resolution at
 

787
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,730
update the arrow hand the resolution at
200 by 200 just isn't enough to update

788
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:02,740
200 by 200 just isn't enough to update
 

789
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,950
200 by 200 just isn't enough to update
more than every two minutes or so and I

790
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
more than every two minutes or so and I
 

791
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
more than every two minutes or so and I
think that was the reason why every two

792
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:06,730
think that was the reason why every two
 

793
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,510
think that was the reason why every two
minutes at updates that were it doesn't

794
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
minutes at updates that were it doesn't
 

795
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,620
minutes at updates that were it doesn't
receive that and the way I did it in

796
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:13,630
receive that and the way I did it in
 

797
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,780
receive that and the way I did it in
order to save memory in the in the

798
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:15,790
order to save memory in the in the
 

799
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,720
order to save memory in the in the
actual pine tome itself was to actually

800
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:18,730
actual pine tome itself was to actually
 

801
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,470
actual pine tome itself was to actually
have three arrays one for the hour hand

802
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
have three arrays one for the hour hand
 

803
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,130
have three arrays one for the hour hand
for all 720 possible positions one for

804
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,140
for all 720 possible positions one for
 

805
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,760
for all 720 possible positions one for
the minute hand for well for 60

806
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:29,770
the minute hand for well for 60
 

807
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,330
the minute hand for well for 60
positions 6-0 60 positions one for the

808
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:33,340
positions 6-0 60 positions one for the
 

809
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,660
positions 6-0 60 positions one for the
second hand for the same 60 positions

810
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:35,670
second hand for the same 60 positions
 

811
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,400
second hand for the same 60 positions
because the they have separate arrays

812
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,410
because the they have separate arrays
 

813
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,230
because the they have separate arrays
for each one because each of the

814
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
for each one because each of the
 

815
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,500
for each one because each of the
clockface hands are all all different

816
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:43,510
clockface hands are all all different
 

817
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,080
clockface hands are all all different
lengths so they all fall on different XY

818
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,090
lengths so they all fall on different XY
 

819
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,970
lengths so they all fall on different XY
coordinates as they go around but as

820
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:47,980
coordinates as they go around but as
 

821
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,820
coordinates as they go around but as
they go around the clock base but yeah

822
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:49,830
they go around the clock base but yeah
 

823
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,900
they go around the clock base but yeah
actually

824
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:53,910

 

825
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,330

my skills main screens I were on a

826
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:57,340
my skills main screens I were on a
 

827
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,860
my skills main screens I were on a
discrete on my machine it's a digital

828
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:00,870
discrete on my machine it's a digital
 

829
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,650
discrete on my machine it's a digital
and local clock and I'm watching it as

830
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:04,660
and local clock and I'm watching it as
 

831
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,400
and local clock and I'm watching it as
you are describing and so and it's

832
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,410
you are describing and so and it's
 

833
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,419
you are describing and so and it's
updating and the mediator is operating

834
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:11,429
updating and the mediator is operating
 

835
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:16,919
updating and the mediator is operating
60 times a minute the minute hand is

836
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:16,929
60 times a minute the minute hand is
 

837
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:19,260
60 times a minute the minute hand is
updating 60 times a minute

838
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,270
updating 60 times a minute
 

839
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,310
updating 60 times a minute
yes is that what you should yes so so

840
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,320
yes is that what you should yes so so
 

841
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,280
yes is that what you should yes so so
that means the minute hand is

842
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,290
that means the minute hand is
 

843
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,630
that means the minute hand is
incrementally moving between the tick

844
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:27,640
incrementally moving between the tick
 

845
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,990
incrementally moving between the tick
marks then yes okay yeah I didn't go to

846
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,000
marks then yes okay yeah I didn't go to
 

847
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,720
marks then yes okay yeah I didn't go to
that level of detail now with with so

848
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:39,730
that level of detail now with with so
 

849
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,020
that level of detail now with with so
booze screen that what probably a 1k

850
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,030
booze screen that what probably a 1k
 

851
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,480
booze screen that what probably a 1k
screen or something right - anybody know

852
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,490
screen or something right - anybody know
 

853
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,510
screen or something right - anybody know
it's like every 1080 by 1920 four or

854
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:48,520
it's like every 1080 by 1920 four or
 

855
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,940
it's like every 1080 by 1920 four or
something you're gonna notice every

856
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:50,950
something you're gonna notice every
 

857
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,580
something you're gonna notice every
single little you know incremental move

858
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,590
single little you know incremental move
 

859
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,890
single little you know incremental move
but at 200 by 200 which is what I

860
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:55,900
but at 200 by 200 which is what I
 

861
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,140
but at 200 by 200 which is what I
believe the resolution is you're just

862
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,150
believe the resolution is you're just
 

863
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,880
believe the resolution is you're just
not going to notice that little movement

864
00:22:59,880 --> 00:22:59,890
not going to notice that little movement
 

865
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,950
not going to notice that little movement
it's just not gonna you're just not

866
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:01,960
it's just not gonna you're just not
 

867
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,260
it's just not gonna you're just not
gonna see it so there's no point trying

868
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,270
gonna see it so there's no point trying
 

869
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:09,180
gonna see it so there's no point trying
to track you can ask your questions

870
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,190
to track you can ask your questions
 

871
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,250
to track you can ask your questions
about it yeah well now the bow is here

872
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:11,260
about it yeah well now the bow is here
 

873
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,900
about it yeah well now the bow is here
we can ask him questions so both vp9 had

874
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:15,910
we can ask him questions so both vp9 had
 

875
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,090
we can ask him questions so both vp9 had
probably the first question which was

876
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,100
probably the first question which was
 

877
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,210
probably the first question which was
what so and I did my best to answer but

878
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:21,220
what so and I did my best to answer but
 

879
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,280
what so and I did my best to answer but
bow you answer better so the the power

880
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,290
bow you answer better so the the power
 

881
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,030
bow you answer better so the the power
module what is the biggest purpose of

882
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,040
module what is the biggest purpose of
 

883
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,320
module what is the biggest purpose of
having app access to that power module

884
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,330
having app access to that power module
 

885
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,620
having app access to that power module
well there's two main reasons one is to

886
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:34,630
well there's two main reasons one is to
 

887
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,810
well there's two main reasons one is to
be able to remotely turn off and turn on

888
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:36,820
be able to remotely turn off and turn on
 

889
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,760
be able to remotely turn off and turn on
your devices that are plugged into it

890
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:38,770
your devices that are plugged into it
 

891
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,130
your devices that are plugged into it
nice perfect so that's lit let's say

892
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,140
nice perfect so that's lit let's say
 

893
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,010
nice perfect so that's lit let's say
that something gets into a into a lock

894
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,020
that something gets into a into a lock
 

895
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,750
that something gets into a into a lock
state or something like that and you're

896
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
state or something like that and you're
 

897
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,970
state or something like that and you're
not there to troubleshoot it just reboot

898
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:47,980
not there to troubleshoot it just reboot
 

899
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,400
not there to troubleshoot it just reboot
it yeah that's great

900
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,410
it yeah that's great
 

901
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,659
it yeah that's great
normally that would be something that

902
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:51,669
normally that would be something that
 

903
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,520
normally that would be something that
you'd have to buy like a server rack

904
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,530
you'd have to buy like a server rack
 

905
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,190
you'd have to buy like a server rack
unit or something they're like idrac

906
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,200
unit or something they're like idrac
 

907
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,120
unit or something they're like idrac
called my server for example right

908
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,130
called my server for example right
 

909
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,770
called my server for example right
another reason you'd want app access to

910
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:01,780
another reason you'd want app access to
 

911
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,390
another reason you'd want app access to
it is to monitor power usage so

912
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
it is to monitor power usage so
 

913
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,090
it is to monitor power usage so
if you're trying to do something that's

914
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,100
if you're trying to do something that's
 

915
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,000
if you're trying to do something that's
little power or or maybe you're trying

916
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,010
little power or or maybe you're trying
 

917
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,660
little power or or maybe you're trying
to manage heat you can see what's what's

918
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:15,670
to manage heat you can see what's what's
 

919
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,660
to manage heat you can see what's what's
pulling power at what times using the

920
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,670
pulling power at what times using the
 

921
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,910
pulling power at what times using the
the history of the power utilization oh

922
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:23,920
the history of the power utilization oh
 

923
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,230
the history of the power utilization oh
that's cool

924
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:25,240
that's cool
 

925
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,400
that's cool
nosh Rubick knowledge now Robbie thought

926
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,410
nosh Rubick knowledge now Robbie thought
 

927
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,330
nosh Rubick knowledge now Robbie thought
that you could change the output work

928
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:33,340
that you could change the output work
 

929
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,480
that you could change the output work

00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
that that would be a great way to to
 

937
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,950
that that would be a great way to to
cook your device you know just keep

938
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:55,960
cook your device you know just keep
 

939
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,750
cook your device you know just keep
incrementally increasing voltage and

940
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
incrementally increasing voltage and
 

941
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,550
incrementally increasing voltage and
presumably that unit is powered

942
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:05,560
presumably that unit is powered
 

943
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,820
presumably that unit is powered
separately from your from your rock crow

944
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:08,830
separately from your from your rock crow
 

945
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,590
separately from your from your rock crow
or whatever it is that you connected it

946
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:10,600
or whatever it is that you connected it
 

947
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,510
or whatever it is that you connected it
it would be the power supply for it yeah

948
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:14,520
it would be the power supply for it yeah
 

949
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,880
it would be the power supply for it yeah
connected you wouldn't use this for a

950
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:17,890
connected you wouldn't use this for a
 

951
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,890
connected you wouldn't use this for a
rock Pro because it's a rock goes 12

952
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:19,900
rock Pro because it's a rock goes 12
 

953
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,210
rock Pro because it's a rock goes 12
volts and this is a 5 volt power supply

954
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:21,220
volts and this is a 5 volt power supply
 

955
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,270
volts and this is a 5 volt power supply
oh this is 5 volts okay okay anything

956
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,280
oh this is 5 volts okay okay anything
 

957
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,850
oh this is 5 volts okay okay anything
that's 5 volt this can you just can run

958
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:26,860
that's 5 volt this can you just can run
 

959
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,040
that's 5 volt this can you just can run
that up to I forget how many amps 5 amps

960
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,050
that up to I forget how many amps 5 amps
 

961
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:39,210
that up to I forget how many amps 5 amps
I think yeah you can adjust the output

962
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:39,220
I think yeah you can adjust the output
 

963
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,990
I think yeah you can adjust the output
from 4 volts to 5 point 3 volts DC and

964
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,000
from 4 volts to 5 point 3 volts DC and
 

965
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,400
from 4 volts to 5 point 3 volts DC and
then T and bsp they can can handle that

966
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,410
then T and bsp they can can handle that
 

967
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,880
then T and bsp they can can handle that
without any problem right well 4 volts

968
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:50,890
without any problem right well 4 volts
 

969
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,610
without any problem right well 4 volts
is gonna be kinda iffy for a lot of

970
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:53,620
is gonna be kinda iffy for a lot of
 

971
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,770
is gonna be kinda iffy for a lot of
SPC's but 5.3 is fine yep yep so

972
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:58,780
SPC's but 5.3 is fine yep yep so
 

973
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,560
SPC's but 5.3 is fine yep yep so
somewhere bullet between 4 & 5 is where

974
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,570
somewhere bullet between 4 & 5 is where
 

975
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,960
somewhere bullet between 4 & 5 is where
most SBC's are are gonna start working

976
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:03,970
most SBC's are are gonna start working
 

977
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,690
most SBC's are are gonna start working
well so a heck I can't get in and fry

978
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:06,700
well so a heck I can't get in and fry
 

979
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,390
well so a heck I can't get in and fry
your wrist bc by cranking up the voltage

980
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:09,400
your wrist bc by cranking up the voltage
 

981
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,030
your wrist bc by cranking up the voltage
thing right not if it's a 5 volt SBC

982
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,040
thing right not if it's a 5 volt SBC
 

983
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,100
thing right not if it's a 5 volt SBC
okay nice

984
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,110
okay nice
 

985
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,870
okay nice
now you say Robbie is

986
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
now you say Robbie is
 

987
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,960
now you say Robbie is
it's the power supply for the SBC is it

988
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:21,970
it's the power supply for the SBC is it
 

989
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,930
it's the power supply for the SBC is it
plugged up like a shield or no or a hat

990
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:26,940
plugged up like a shield or no or a hat
 

991
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,720
plugged up like a shield or no or a hat
connect it does have some standoff holes

992
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:32,730
connect it does have some standoff holes
 

993
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,430
connect it does have some standoff holes
but it doesn't bow does this match up

994
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
but it doesn't bow does this match up
 

995
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,130
but it doesn't bow does this match up
with any SBC it doesn't it doesn't look

996
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,140
with any SBC it doesn't it doesn't look
 

997
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,080
with any SBC it doesn't it doesn't look
it's not a P hat that's for sure but

998
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,090
it's not a P hat that's for sure but
 

999
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,560
it's not a P hat that's for sure but
this is a no Droid board no it's it just

1000
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:43,570
this is a no Droid board no it's it just
 

1001
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,690
this is a no Droid board no it's it just
but you can create a standoff or build

1002
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:45,700
but you can create a standoff or build
 

1003
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,980
but you can create a standoff or build
it into a case and if it had some

1004
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:46,990
it into a case and if it had some
 

1005
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,540
it into a case and if it had some
sticker on the back so I could build it

1006
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:48,550
sticker on the back so I could build it
 

1007
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,940
sticker on the back so I could build it
into something if I wanted to yeah it's

1008
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:50,950
into something if I wanted to yeah it's
 

1009
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,470
into something if I wanted to yeah it's
a standalone unit and you need to have

1010
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,480
a standalone unit and you need to have
 

1011
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
a standalone unit and you need to have
you need to cut off the end of a power

1012
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,250
you need to cut off the end of a power
 

1013
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,240
you need to cut off the end of a power
supply or something to to wired into

1014
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,250
supply or something to to wired into
 

1015
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:08,370
supply or something to to wired into
that okay this is the input then I just

1016
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:08,380
that okay this is the input then I just
 

1017
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,860
that okay this is the input then I just
opened it is where you plug into the

1018
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:13,870
opened it is where you plug into the
 

1019
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,400
opened it is where you plug into the
wall and then that green connector is

1020
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,410
wall and then that green connector is
 

1021
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,030
wall and then that green connector is
where you connect your SPC's power

1022
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,040
where you connect your SPC's power
 

1023
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,470
where you connect your SPC's power
supply a power cable into you oh okay so

1024
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:25,480
supply a power cable into you oh okay so
 

1025
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,390
supply a power cable into you oh okay so
that this power is providing power to

1026
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:27,400
that this power is providing power to
 

1027
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,000
that this power is providing power to
the Wi-Fi module and the system itself

1028
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,010
the Wi-Fi module and the system itself
 

1029
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,770
the Wi-Fi module and the system itself
no no that's unite power what you just

1030
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:31,780
no no that's unite power what you just
 

1031
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,390
no no that's unite power what you just
pointed to is the input that barrel

1032
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:33,400
pointed to is the input that barrel
 

1033
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,820
pointed to is the input that barrel
connector if I understand boat correctly

1034
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:35,830
connector if I understand boat correctly
 

1035
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,470
connector if I understand boat correctly
that barrel connector is where you plug

1036
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:37,480
that barrel connector is where you plug
 

1037
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,200
that barrel connector is where you plug
the war war into yep the device right

1038
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,210
the war war into yep the device right
 

1039
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,870
the war war into yep the device right
that's that powers the device then the

1040
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
that's that powers the device then the
 

1041
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,800
that's that powers the device then the
green block then the green block is the

1042
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:46,810
green block then the green block is the
 

1043
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,960
green block then the green block is the
output of this device that you feed

1044
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:48,970
output of this device that you feed
 

1045
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,510
output of this device that you feed
power to your SBC to it from that block

1046
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
power to your SBC to it from that block
 

1047
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,390
power to your SBC to it from that block
is that right Bo yeah that's right okay

1048
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:57,400
is that right Bo yeah that's right okay
 

1049
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,610
is that right Bo yeah that's right okay
so then so then I ask okay so we've got

1050
00:27:59,610 --> 00:27:59,620
so then so then I ask okay so we've got
 

1051
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,720
so then so then I ask okay so we've got
USB a and we're SB micro yeah the USB a

1052
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:06,730
USB a and we're SB micro yeah the USB a
 

1053
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:14,880
USB a and we're SB micro yeah the USB a
is power up to be lighter or oh it's

1054
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:14,890
is power up to be lighter or oh it's
 

1055
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,250
is power up to be lighter or oh it's
waynebow okay so five you go one amp

1056
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,260
waynebow okay so five you go one amp
 

1057
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,470
waynebow okay so five you go one amp
yeah you can do both at the same time

1058
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,480
yeah you can do both at the same time
 

1059
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,250
yeah you can do both at the same time
okay cool and the the micro USB

1060
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:25,260
okay cool and the the micro USB
 

1061
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,050
okay cool and the the micro USB
connection I believe is for connecting

1062
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,060
connection I believe is for connecting
 

1063
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,870
connection I believe is for connecting
directly to a computer that you want to

1064
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
directly to a computer that you want to
 

1065
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,220
directly to a computer that you want to
have control this oh cool

1066
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,230
have control this oh cool
 

1067
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,100
have control this oh cool
or you can do it via Wi-Fi yeah nice

1068
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,110
or you can do it via Wi-Fi yeah nice
 

1069
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,710
or you can do it via Wi-Fi yeah nice
cool I'm looking forward to that very

1070
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
cool I'm looking forward to that very
 

1071
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,389
cool I'm looking forward to that very
cool very nice cool okay so what you're

1072
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:43,399
cool very nice cool okay so what you're
 

1073
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,680
cool very nice cool okay so what you're
gonna do now is figure out how to

1074
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:44,690
gonna do now is figure out how to
 

1075
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,919
gonna do now is figure out how to
remotely reboot your machine your SPC

1076
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:47,929
remotely reboot your machine your SPC
 

1077
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:50,289
remotely reboot your machine your SPC
yeah you've got to connect to it somehow

1078
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:50,299
yeah you've got to connect to it somehow
 

1079
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:52,120
yeah you've got to connect to it somehow
is it so we really yeah

1080
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,130
is it so we really yeah
 

1081
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,180
is it so we really yeah
is that food we're in there Sara like

1082
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,190
is that food we're in there Sara like
 

1083
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,149
is that food we're in there Sara like
yep yeah there's a firmware in there but

1084
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:58,159
yep yeah there's a firmware in there but
 

1085
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,009
yep yeah there's a firmware in there but
you can SSH into or whatever you need to

1086
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:00,019
you can SSH into or whatever you need to
 

1087
