of my server rack I'll show you some
time at the studio is it HC one with my

622
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:55,730
time at the studio is it HC one with my
 

623
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,430
time at the studio is it HC one with my

good I had a yeah yeah so they did

934
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:58,760
good I had a yeah yeah so they did
 

935
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,010
good I had a yeah yeah so they did
reliably they did wind up doing oh yeah

936
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,020
reliably they did wind up doing oh yeah
 

937
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,030
reliably they did wind up doing oh yeah
he does like they did the wouldn't work

938
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,040
he does like they did the wouldn't work
 

939
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,970
he does like they did the wouldn't work
oh yeah I imagine if it's using the

940
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:09,980
oh yeah I imagine if it's using the
 

941
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,460
oh yeah I imagine if it's using the
Linux file system it is gonna be case

942
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:12,470
Linux file system it is gonna be case
 

943
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,170
Linux file system it is gonna be case
sensitive

944
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:13,180
sensitive
 

945
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,840
sensitive
in Linux like slash if you had a folder

946
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:16,850
in Linux like slash if you had a folder
 

947
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,450
in Linux like slash if you had a folder
called slash home with a capital H that

948
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:19,460
called slash home with a capital H that
 

949
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,010
called slash home with a capital H that
would not be your home folder that would

950
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,020
would not be your home folder that would
 

951
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,720
would not be your home folder that would
actually be interpreted as a different

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:22,730
actually be interpreted as a different
 

953
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,970
actually be interpreted as a different
home a different directory all the other

954
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:24,980
home a different directory all the other
 

955
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,400
home a different directory all the other
yeah I get which one does code which

956
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,410
yeah I get which one does code which
 

957
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,490
yeah I get which one does code which
what do you put will they will like it's

958
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:30,500
what do you put will they will like it's
 

959
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,120
what do you put will they will like it's
all lowercase you know I did glad to be

960
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,130
all lowercase you know I did glad to be
 

961
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,910
all lowercase you know I did glad to be
quite good are they to you don't you

962
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:35,920
quite good are they to you don't you
 

963
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,320
quite good are they to you don't you
know what you'd probably be best to do

964
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,330
know what you'd probably be best to do
 

965
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,670
know what you'd probably be best to do
though like if you're looking at the

966
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:39,680
though like if you're looking at the
 

967
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,520
though like if you're looking at the
Linux file system for the home folder is

968
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:41,530
Linux file system for the home folder is
 

969
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,840
Linux file system for the home folder is
it's going to be installed as the user

970
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:43,850
it's going to be installed as the user
 

971
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,490
it's going to be installed as the user
and running as the user right so the

972
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,500
and running as the user right so the
 

973
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,000
and running as the user right so the
home is just a tilde so tilde always

974
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,010
home is just a tilde so tilde always
 

975
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,310
home is just a tilde so tilde always
resolves to the users home folder so if

976
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,320
resolves to the users home folder so if
 

977
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,100
resolves to the users home folder so if
you're logged in as Peter then slash

978
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,110
you're logged in as Peter then slash
 

979
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,010
you're logged in as Peter then slash
home slash Peter is your home folder but

980
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,020
home slash Peter is your home folder but
 

981
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,590
home slash Peter is your home folder but
you can just use tilde slash and that

982
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,600
you can just use tilde slash and that
 

983
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,170
you can just use tilde slash and that
will be slash home slash Peter you can

984
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:02,180
will be slash home slash Peter you can
 

985
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,800
will be slash home slash Peter you can
take you there automatically like that
