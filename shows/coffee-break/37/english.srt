129
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,770
is I think where they used to bring in
stuff during war times and so that was

130
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:13,780
stuff during war times and so that was
 

131
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,240
stuff during war times and so that was
like a I don't know if it was a barracks

132
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,250
like a I don't know if it was a barracks
 

133
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,130
like a I don't know if it was a barracks
or we couldn't we couldn't actually go

134
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,140
or we couldn't we couldn't actually go
 

135
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,950

137
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,980
into the fort so but but we got to enjoy
the trails but I believe the trails used

138
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:22,990
the trails but I believe the trails used
 

139
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,860
the trails but I believe the trails used
to be rail trails and so the portage was

140
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:25,870
to be rail trails and so the portage was
 

141
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,080
to be rail trails and so the portage was
bringing things in from the water into

142
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,090
bringing things in from the water into
 

143
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,700
bringing things in from the water into
the fort I think okay okay so we're

further they have to get out of the
 

157
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,220
further they have to get out of the
water and carry their watercraft on

158
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,230
water and carry their watercraft on
 

159
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,620
water and carry their watercraft on
their shoulders that is what I

160
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:52,630
their shoulders that is what I
 

161
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,110
their shoulders that is what I
understand a portage to mean but yeah

162
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
understand a portage to mean but yeah
 

163
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,800
understand a portage to mean but yeah
that makes sense

164
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:55,810
that makes sense
 

165
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,680
that makes sense
so in this context I guess it's the name

166
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:58,690

167
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,900
so in this context I guess it's the name
would come from what what its original

168
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:00,910
would come from what what its original
 

169
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,060
would come from what what its original
intention was and what its original use

170
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,070
intention was and what its original use
 

171
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,699
intention was and what its original use
was yeah forged by the beautiful trails

172
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:05,709

and let you take photos all around the
 

493
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,320
and let you take photos all around the
plane for them from the outside and they

494
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,330
plane for them from the outside and they
 

495
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,320
plane for them from the outside and they
cut everything to get there and the

496
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,330
cut everything to get there and the
 

497
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,420
cut everything to get there and the
plane landed and a one car didn't get

498
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,430
plane landed and a one car didn't get
 

499
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,360

those clothes used they edited it looked

500
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,370
those clothes used they edited it looked
 

501
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,830
those clothes used they edited it looked
like at the depth so modern technology

502
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:37,840
like at the depth so modern technology
 

503
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,100
like at the depth so modern technology
and then taking a photo you can take out

504
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,110
and then taking a photo you can take out
 

505
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,120
and then taking a photo you can take out
everything so they used a hold a camera

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,090
standing overlooking the highway and
 

509
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,050
standing overlooking the highway and
over the course of the day and they had

over the course of the day and they had
 

511
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,970
over the course of the day and they had
an image of all the elements of the run

512
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:58,980
an image of all the elements of the run
 

513
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,540
an image of all the elements of the run
with no cost so thank you something out

514
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:03,550
with no cost so thank you something out
 

515
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,490
with no cost so thank you something out
of a picture is well there's a there is

516
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:08,500
of a picture is well there's a there is
 

517
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,090
of a picture is well there's a there is
a little-known fact from

518
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,100
a little-known fact from
 

519
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,190
a little-known fact from
way that I'm not sure many people know

520
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
way that I'm not sure many people know
 

521
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,530
way that I'm not sure many people know
but the interstate system here in the

522
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,540
but the interstate system here in the
 

523
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:22,400
but the interstate system here in the
United States has many straight sections

524
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,410
United States has many straight sections
 

525
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,540
United States has many straight sections
of Interstate something like at least 2

526
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:26,550
of Interstate something like at least 2
 

527
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,760
of Interstate something like at least 2
miles long which is ten thousand four

528
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:31,770
miles long which is ten thousand four
 

529
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,660
miles long which is ten thousand four
hundred and whatever it is feet and the

530
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:35,670
hundred and whatever it is feet and the
 

531
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,600
hundred and whatever it is feet and the
reason for that is to allow that this

532
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:38,610
reason for that is to allow that this
 

533
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,030
reason for that is to allow that this
was even better no no the interstate

534
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
was even better no no the interstate
 

535
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
was even better no no the interstate
systems are relatively recent like the

536
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,050
systems are relatively recent like the
 

537
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,750
systems are relatively recent like the
60s or 70s but it allows for emergency

538
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
60s or 70s but it allows for emergency
 

539
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,380
60s or 70s but it allows for emergency
landing of military craft and for and

540
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,390
landing of military craft and for and
 

541
00:13:51,390 --> 00:14:05,630
landing of military craft and for and
for commercial airlines in need this Air

542
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:05,640
for commercial airlines in need this Air
 

543
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,330
for commercial airlines in need this Air
Force they have a database of all roads

544
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:11,340
Force they have a database of all roads
 

545
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,470
Force they have a database of all roads
of any condition of the length and so in

546
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:15,480
of any condition of the length and so in
 

547
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,220
of any condition of the length and so in
case over war they have the entire

548
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,230
case over war they have the entire
 

549
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,660
case over war they have the entire
county road network to use as an airport

550
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:25,670
county road network to use as an airport
 

551
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,430
county road network to use as an airport
listen this is not every single piece of

552
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:28,440
listen this is not every single piece of
 

553
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,280
listen this is not every single piece of
road but certainly my understanding is

554
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,290
road but certainly my understanding is
 

555
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,290
road but certainly my understanding is
it's the interstates but yes yes as a

556
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:36,300
it's the interstates but yes yes as a
 

557
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,980
it's the interstates but yes yes as a
matter of fact as a matter of fact I

before I saw a video on Facebook of a
 

563
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,010
before I saw a video on Facebook of a
light plane landing on an expressway

564
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,020
light plane landing on an expressway
 

565
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,850
light plane landing on an expressway
yeah emergency landing that does happen

566
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:49,860
yeah emergency landing that does happen
 

567
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,300

of the practice but really don't land on
roads oh yeah craziest one I saw

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:14,190
it's real
we're the plane it was a it was one of

616
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,200
we're the plane it was a it was one of
 

617
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,530
we're the plane it was a it was one of
those like planes outta Reno you know

618
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:16,540
those like planes outta Reno you know

apparently the the video shows one of
 

623
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,230
apparently the the video shows one of
the wings coming off and then shows the

624
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,240
the wings coming off and then shows the
 

625
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,630
the wings coming off and then shows the
pilot flying sideways in front of the

626
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:27,640
pilot flying sideways in front of the
 

627
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,200
pilot flying sideways in front of the
audience

628
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,210
audience
 

629
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,600
audience
literally sideways like that you could

630
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:30,610
literally sideways like that you could
 

631
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,190
literally sideways like that you could
see the belly of the plane he was using

632
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,200
see the belly of the plane he was using
 

633
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,870
see the belly of the plane he was using
their brother to keep the nose up and

634
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:33,880
their brother to keep the nose up and
 

635
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,820
their brother to keep the nose up and
then at the very last second he flipped

636
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:35,830
then at the very last second he flipped
 

637
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,520
then at the very last second he flipped
the plane you know flip the plane

638
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:38,530
the plane you know flip the plane
 

639
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,880
the plane you know flip the plane
vertical and and landed it I wonder

640
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:41,890
vertical and and landed it I wonder
 

641
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,580
vertical and and landed it I wonder
that's the one I saw yeah yeah I'm

642
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:44,590
that's the one I saw yeah yeah I'm
 

643
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,140
that's the one I saw yeah yeah I'm
looking I'm not convinced that was real

644
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,150
looking I'm not convinced that was real
 

645
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:53,730
looking I'm not convinced that was real
life I think it was a fake an Israeli

646
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:53,740
life I think it was a fake an Israeli
 

647
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,090
life I think it was a fake an Israeli
f-18 pilot now this was not a military

648
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,100
f-18 pilot now this was not a military
 

649
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
f-18 pilot now this was not a military
aircraft this was one of those racing

650
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,110
aircraft this was one of those racing
 

651
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:07,610
aircraft this was one of those racing
aircraft I'm not sure if they were

652
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:07,620
aircraft I'm not sure if they were
 

653
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:15,920
aircraft I'm not sure if they were
people on board but something happened

654
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:15,930

 

655
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,270

confrontation which I think and then he

656
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
confrontation which I think and then he
 

657
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,250
confrontation which I think and then he
had their warning warning signals and he

658
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,260
had their warning warning signals and he
 

659
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,160
had their warning warning signals and he
had to land and it was not until he

660
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,170
had to land and it was not until he
 

661
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,420
had to land and it was not until he
landed that he noticed that his his his

662
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:30,430
landed that he noticed that his his his
 

663
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,320
landed that he noticed that his his his
entire left wing was missing he was

664
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,330
entire left wing was missing he was
 

665
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,390
entire left wing was missing he was
flying with wronging how do you not

666
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
flying with wronging how do you not
 

667
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
flying with wronging how do you not
notice that

668
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:37,850
notice that
 

669
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,510
notice that
I just ran a marathon and then at the

670
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,520
I just ran a marathon and then at the
 

671
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,860
I just ran a marathon and then at the
end of it I just realized that I only

672
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:41,870
end of it I just realized that I only
 

673
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:52,720
end of it I just realized that I only
had one leg yeah thank you everything is

674
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:52,730
had one leg yeah thank you everything is
 

675
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,740
had one leg yeah thank you everything is
shaking you are preoccupied keeping the

676
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:56,750
shaking you are preoccupied keeping the
 

677
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,430
shaking you are preoccupied keeping the
plane in the air

678
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
plane in the air
 

679
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,250
plane in the air
and in a military plane you can just

680
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:00,260
and in a military plane you can just
 

681
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,310
and in a military plane you can just
speed it up and eventually it just but

682
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
speed it up and eventually it just but
 

683
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,040
speed it up and eventually it just but
you still have to land by is to lightly

684
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,050
you still have to land by is to lightly
 

685
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:14,950
you still have to land by is to lightly
speed it's not if you're landing if

686
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
speed it's not if you're landing if
 

687
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,900
speed it's not if you're landing if
you're flying fast enough you won't land

688
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:16,910
you're flying fast enough you won't land
 

689
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,700
you're flying fast enough you won't land
that's the problem the whole point of

690
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:21,710
that's the problem the whole point of
 

691
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,890
that's the problem the whole point of
landing the aircraft is managing all

692
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:23,900
landing the aircraft is managing all
 

693
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,200
landing the aircraft is managing all
that kinetic kinetic energy and bringing

694
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,210
that kinetic kinetic energy and bringing
 

695
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:38,700
that kinetic kinetic energy and bringing
it to lift from that one side so your

696
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:38,710
it to lift from that one side so your
 

697
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:48,220
it to lift from that one side so your
plane will go into a spin he was and he

698
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,230
plane will go into a spin he was and he
 

699
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:55,750
plane will go into a spin he was and he
was skied and it also showed planes are

700
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
was skied and it also showed planes are
 

701
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,870
was skied and it also showed planes are
capable of when they need you the thing

702
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
capable of when they need you the thing
 

703
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
capable of when they need you the thing
that I remember about military aircraft

704
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,370
that I remember about military aircraft
 

705
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,400
that I remember about military aircraft
especially the lighter ones is they are

706
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,410
especially the lighter ones is they are
 

707
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,610
especially the lighter ones is they are
inherently unstable you cannot fly them

708
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:06,620
inherently unstable you cannot fly them
 

709
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,470
inherently unstable you cannot fly them
without the computer yes yeah that

710
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
without the computer yes yeah that
 

711
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,670
without the computer yes yeah that
computer has to be running or otherwise

712
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:12,680
computer has to be running or otherwise
 

713
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,260
computer has to be running or otherwise
the plane just won't fly

714
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,270
the plane just won't fly
 

715
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,080
the plane just won't fly
I think the f16 was the first plane that

716
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,090
I think the f16 was the first plane that
 

717
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,730
I think the f16 was the first plane that
but whether it can do that without a

718
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:21,740
but whether it can do that without a
 

719
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,290
but whether it can do that without a
wing is a whole nother question going

720
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,300
wing is a whole nother question going
 

721
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,060
wing is a whole nother question going
Mach 3 yeah bye

722

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,040
discovered what it was the agile Library
 

729
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,650
discovered what it was the agile Library
in Nazareth with Rome it didn't

730
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:44,660
in Nazareth with Rome it didn't
 

731
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,610
in Nazareth with Rome it didn't
capitalize the the and things like that

751
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,330
can run it as a process to go like a

gosh my Bosch window is like just a
 

775
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,230
gosh my Bosch window is like just a
black screen and I don't ever I don't

ever do is that for audio anything you
 

779
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,610
ever do is that for audio anything you
could anything you can do with the
