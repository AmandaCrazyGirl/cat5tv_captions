for the annual the airplanes got to go
in for its annual you know so sorry we

164
00:04:59,129 --> 00:04:59,139
in for its annual you know so sorry we
 

165
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:03,480
in for its annual you know so sorry we
lost either bp9 you hear airplane was

166
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,490
lost either bp9 you hear airplane was
 

167
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,909
lost either bp9 you hear airplane was
going in for its annual yeah that's

168
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
going in for its annual yeah that's
 

169
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,460
going in for its annual yeah that's
annual inspection that's all it's just

170
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,470
annual inspection that's all it's just
 

171
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,230
annual inspection that's all it's just
judging and if that happens every year

172
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
judging and if that happens every year
 

173
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,659
judging and if that happens every year
and I was just joking that it happens

174
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:12,669
and I was just joking that it happens
 

175
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,129
and I was just joking that it happens
every year therefore and but anyway I

176
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:16,139
every year therefore and but anyway I
 

177
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:24,480
every year therefore and but anyway I
did catch up with the with the community

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,490
did catch up with the with the community
 

179
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,710
did catch up with the with the community
coffee break thank you

180
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:25,720
coffee break thank you
 

181
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,950
coffee break thank you
from Saturday and Robby you were

182
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
from Saturday and Robby you were
 

183
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,830
from Saturday and Robby you were
confused about about so I don't I

184
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
confused about about so I don't I
 

185
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,219
confused about about so I don't I
wouldn't ever put that past me yeah yeah

186
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:35,229
wouldn't ever put that past me yeah yeah
 

187
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,860
wouldn't ever put that past me yeah yeah
it's not a huge deal yeah I don't know

188
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:37,870
it's not a huge deal yeah I don't know
 

189
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,810
it's not a huge deal yeah I don't know
if you ever figured

190
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:38,820
if you ever figured
 

191
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,610
if you ever figured
I couldn't what was that confused ago

192
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:40,620
I couldn't what was that confused ago
 

193
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,230
I couldn't what was that confused ago
this time BP now Peter was trying to

194
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
this time BP now Peter was trying to
 

195
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,290
this time BP now Peter was trying to
explain what what programming land she

196
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,300
explain what what programming land she
 

197
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,180
explain what what programming land she
was you're asking what programming

198
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,190
was you're asking what programming
 

199
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,660
was you're asking what programming
language having and he kept Peter kept

200
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:50,670
language having and he kept Peter kept
 

201
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,240
language having and he kept Peter kept
saying Lazarus and you recognized that

202
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,250
saying Lazarus and you recognized that
 

203
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,360
saying Lazarus and you recognized that
that was the IDE yet you're actually

204
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,370
that was the IDE yet you're actually
 

205
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,090
that was the IDE yet you're actually
working you're actually he was actually

206
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,100
working you're actually he was actually
 

207
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,500
working you're actually he was actually
coding in Pascal in cash cow okay yeah

208
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,510
coding in Pascal in cash cow okay yeah
 

209
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,440
coding in Pascal in cash cow okay yeah
yeah so apparently Lazarus is just that

210
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,450
yeah so apparently Lazarus is just that
 

211
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,830
yeah so apparently Lazarus is just that
is just a Pascal IDE now there is a

212
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
is just a Pascal IDE now there is a
 

213
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,860
is just a Pascal IDE now there is a
Pascal compiler on Linux and you don't

214
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:12,870
Pascal compiler on Linux and you don't
 

215
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,520
Pascal compiler on Linux and you don't
need the Lazarus IDE to do that ain't

216
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,530
need the Lazarus IDE to do that ain't
 

217
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,880
need the Lazarus IDE to do that ain't
it's called free Pascal compiler if PC I

218
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:19,890
it's called free Pascal compiler if PC I
 

219
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,580
it's called free Pascal compiler if PC I
believe I'd not try that I don't have

220
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:22,590
believe I'd not try that I don't have
 

221
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,160
believe I'd not try that I don't have
any none of my Pascal source code

222
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,170
any none of my Pascal source code
 

223
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,740
any none of my Pascal source code
survived so I don't have any it's a

224
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:27,750
survived so I don't have any it's a
 

225
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,550
survived so I don't have any it's a
trying down a flattened disk somewhere

226
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
trying down a flattened disk somewhere
 

227
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,250
trying down a flattened disk somewhere
my floppy disks have grown some fuzz

228
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,260
my floppy disks have grown some fuzz
 

229
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,780
my floppy disks have grown some fuzz
literally grown gray fuzz

230
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:35,790
literally grown gray fuzz
 

231
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,790
literally grown gray fuzz
there are literally there are like wound

232
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:37,800
there are literally there are like wound
 

233
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,550
there are literally there are like wound
trails or something or no and that

234
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
trails or something or no and that
 

235
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,890
trails or something or no and that
happens if you store them for long

236
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:42,900
happens if you store them for long
 

237
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,960
happens if you store them for long
enough and and don't do anything with

238
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:44,970
enough and and don't do anything with
 

239
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,170
enough and and don't do anything with
them and you know try to read them or

240
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,180
them and you know try to read them or
 

241
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,990
them and you know try to read them or
something and yeah I was very very lucky

242
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,000
something and yeah I was very very lucky
 

243
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,520
something and yeah I was very very lucky
to get to get you know three or four

244
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,530
to get to get you know three or four
 

245
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,100
to get to get you know three or four
disks to be able to get the data off

246
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,110
disks to be able to get the data off
 

247
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,530
disks to be able to get the data off
three or four disks to put on the SD

248
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:00,540
three or four disks to put on the SD
 

249
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,050
three or four disks to put on the SD
cards but yeah yeah no joy those were

250
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,060
cards but yeah yeah no joy those were
 

251
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,410
cards but yeah yeah no joy those were
the days mmm it was a running code I

252
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:12,420
the days mmm it was a running code I
 

253
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,310
the days mmm it was a running code I
take to not those goes needing

254
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,320
take to not those goes needing
 

255
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,580
take to not those goes needing
grandstand ah okay you compiled it you

256
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:19,590
grandstand ah okay you compiled it you
 

257
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,050
grandstand ah okay you compiled it you
already compiled it gotcha

258
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,060
already compiled it gotcha
 

259
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,700
already compiled it gotcha
yeah you been there well unless your

260
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:25,710
yeah you been there well unless your
 

261
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,100
yeah you been there well unless your
Linux glory and getting to view together

262
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,110
Linux glory and getting to view together
 

263
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,580
Linux glory and getting to view together
if they have to run it on my pine book

264
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:34,590
if they have to run it on my pine book
 

265
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,860
if they have to run it on my pine book
or something yeah

266
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:37,870

 

267
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,370

so I was just yeah just saying that I

268
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:42,380
so I was just yeah just saying that I
 

269
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,320
so I was just yeah just saying that I
had been so long since I've touched

270
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,330
had been so long since I've touched
 

271
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,990
had been so long since I've touched
Pascal that I would be I would be

272
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,000
Pascal that I would be I would be
 

273
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,150
Pascal that I would be I would be
twisting to try today on I don't think I

274
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
twisting to try today on I don't think I
 

275
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,480
twisting to try today on I don't think I
ever have to do that as well so my

276
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,490
ever have to do that as well so my
 

277
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,879
ever have to do that as well so my
language these days is see that's what I

278
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:57,889
language these days is see that's what I
 

279
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,940
language these days is see that's what I
do and I sort of presentation from

280
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:00,950
do and I sort of presentation from
 

281
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,760
do and I sort of presentation from
Dennis Ritchie I believe it was where he

282
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:03,770
Dennis Ritchie I believe it was where he
 

283
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,510
Dennis Ritchie I believe it was where he
was trying to you know trying to work up

284
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:06,520
was trying to you know trying to work up
 

285
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,879
was trying to you know trying to work up
C++ trying to see how how wonderful it

286
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:09,889
C++ trying to see how how wonderful it
 

287
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,219
C++ trying to see how how wonderful it
was I've not had that experience with

288
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:12,229
was I've not had that experience with
 

289
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,110
was I've not had that experience with
C++ my experience with C++ is you know

290
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
C++ my experience with C++ is you know
 

291
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,680
C++ my experience with C++ is you know
you mess up one character and the

292
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:20,690
you mess up one character and the
 

293
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,510
you mess up one character and the
compiler will just blow up in your face

294
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:22,520
compiler will just blow up in your face
 

295
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,850
compiler will just blow up in your face
it will it will throw pages of Error

296
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:24,860
it will it will throw pages of Error
 

297
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,230
it will it will throw pages of Error
error messages at you and it's often

298
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,240
error messages at you and it's often
 

299
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,990
error messages at you and it's often
very difficult to figure out what

300
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
very difficult to figure out what
 

301
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,300
very difficult to figure out what
exactly you messed up it's like testing

302
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,310
exactly you messed up it's like testing
 

303
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:45,520
exactly you messed up it's like testing
an HTML code and you check it it's also

304
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:45,530
an HTML code and you check it it's also
 

305
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:55,079
an HTML code and you check it it's also
just called HTML a programming language

306
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:55,089

 

307
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:00,130

and then you fix 100 you know you know

308
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,140
and then you fix 100 you know you know
 

309
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,040
and then you fix 100 you know you know
it's so bird calling HTML a programming

310
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,050
it's so bird calling HTML a programming
 

311
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,500
it's so bird calling HTML a programming
language is like calling PHP a

312
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,510
language is like calling PHP a
 

313
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:13,000
language is like calling PHP a
programming language a PHP outputs HTML

314
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,010
programming language a PHP outputs HTML
 

315
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,220
programming language a PHP outputs HTML
I have to say it I had to say it's come

316
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,230
I have to say it I had to say it's come
 

317

that's not compiling it that is just
 

327
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,560

better in Windows and it's not working
as well in Linux on his that could be

786
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:39,870
as well in Linux on his that could be
 

787
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,600
as well in Linux on his that could be
that could be due to any number of

788
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,610
that could be due to any number of
 

789
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,760
that could be due to any number of
things I know I mentioned this when we

790
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:43,770
things I know I mentioned this when we
 

791
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,880
things I know I mentioned this when we
talked three or four days ago it all

792
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:46,890
talked three or four days ago it all
 

793
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,470
talked three or four days ago it all
depends on the configuration of your

794
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
depends on the configuration of your
 

795
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,810
depends on the configuration of your
machine and if your audio dry your your

796
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:50,820
machine and if your audio dry your your
 

797
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,600
machine and if your audio dry your your
sound card is properly configured that's

798
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:53,610
sound card is properly configured that's
 

799
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,150
sound card is properly configured that's
going to be the biggest thing so yeah

800
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,160
going to be the biggest thing so yeah
 

801
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,659
going to be the biggest thing so yeah
it's tough so

802
00:24:58,659 --> 00:24:58,669
it's tough so
 

803
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:00,789
it's tough so
have a lot of experience with that I

804
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
have a lot of experience with that I
 

805
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,200
have a lot of experience with that I
just learned the system figure it out

806
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,210
just learned the system figure it out
 

807
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,649
just learned the system figure it out
for each other yeah I did he told the

808
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:05,659
for each other yeah I did he told the
 

809
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,720
for each other yeah I did he told the
debt collector thing to do that but he

810
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,730
debt collector thing to do that but he
 

811
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,330
debt collector thing to do that but he
did that debated Rohtak they said then

812
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:10,340
did that debated Rohtak they said then
 

813
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,999
did that debated Rohtak they said then
they don't get to make well I got very

814
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:13,009
they don't get to make well I got very
 

815
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:19,379
they don't get to make well I got very
good at anyway they'd gone anyway yeah

816
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:19,389

 

817
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:23,019

you know my ailing no very good but he's

hearing isn't that any good I was

824
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:36,739
hearing isn't that any good I was
 

825
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:39,820
hearing isn't that any good I was
thinking of audio when I was editing at

826
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:39,830
thinking of audio when I was editing at
 

827
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,950
thinking of audio when I was editing at
the studio on Sunday yesterday my audio

828
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
the studio on Sunday yesterday my audio
 

829
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,529
the studio on Sunday yesterday my audio
or my video editor DaVinci Resolve I

830
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:47,539
or my video editor DaVinci Resolve I
 

831
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:49,180
or my video editor DaVinci Resolve I
wasn't getting any sound out of it and

832
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,190
wasn't getting any sound out of it and
 

833
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,249
wasn't getting any sound out of it and
I'm like what is going on because I've

834
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:51,259
I'm like what is going on because I've
 

835
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,769
I'm like what is going on because I've
been plugging everything in it detected

836
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:53,779
been plugging everything in it detected
 

837
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:58,180
been plugging everything in it detected
like 15 different sound outputs so it

838
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,190
like 15 different sound outputs so it
 

839
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,669
like 15 different sound outputs so it
ended up it ended up sending the audio

840
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:00,679
ended up it ended up sending the audio
 

841
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:03,369
ended up it ended up sending the audio
to one of the TVs in the in the studio

842
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:03,379
to one of the TVs in the in the studio
 

843
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:06,580
to one of the TVs in the in the studio
the next room over so I'm trying I'm

844
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:06,590
the next room over so I'm trying I'm
 

845
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,470
the next room over so I'm trying I'm
trying to figure out where the audio is

846
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,480
trying to figure out where the audio is
 

847
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,779
trying to figure out where the audio is
going so I had to remap the sound in the

848
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:10,789
going so I had to remap the sound in the
 

849
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:12,249
going so I had to remap the sound in the
Vinci resolve which is cool that you can

850
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:12,259
Vinci resolve which is cool that you can
 

851
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:14,379
Vinci resolve which is cool that you can
do this you could actually select the

852
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:14,389
do this you could actually select the
 

853
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:17,560
do this you could actually select the
sound card specifically and then it

854
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:17,570
sound card specifically and then it
 

855
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,509
sound card specifically and then it
shows you all the outputs on the sound

856
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:19,519
shows you all the outputs on the sound
 

857
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,340
shows you all the outputs on the sound
device so in my case it had seven

858
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,350
device so in my case it had seven
 

859
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,909
device so in my case it had seven
outputs or or maybe eight and so I

860
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:24,919
outputs or or maybe eight and so I
 

861
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,259
outputs or or maybe eight and so I
selected the first two and sure enough

862
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:26,269
selected the first two and sure enough
 

863
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:29,220
selected the first two and sure enough
that's left and right and in that work

864
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,230
that's left and right and in that work
 

865
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,409
that's left and right and in that work
but goodness me I'm gonna have to figure

866
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:32,419
but goodness me I'm gonna have to figure
 

867
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:34,060
but goodness me I'm gonna have to figure
out how to like set up a permanent

868
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,070
out how to like set up a permanent
 

869
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,899
out how to like set up a permanent
solution because it's crazy

870
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:36,909
solution because it's crazy
 

871
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,499
solution because it's crazy
yeah I ordered some couplers for HDMI

872
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:41,509
yeah I ordered some couplers for HDMI
 

873
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,070
yeah I ordered some couplers for HDMI
off of Amazon which i think is an

874
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
off of Amazon which i think is an
 

875
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,960
off of Amazon which i think is an
experiment experiment because I'm trying

876
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:46,970
experiment experiment because I'm trying
 

877
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,310
experiment experiment because I'm trying
to figure out how to get the cameras a

878
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
to figure out how to get the cameras a
 

879
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,169
to figure out how to get the cameras a
little bit more slack in the studio

880
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:50,179
little bit more slack in the studio
 

881
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:52,659
little bit more slack in the studio
because right now it's like there's like

882
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:52,669
because right now it's like there's like
 

883
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,519
because right now it's like there's like
four feet of cable coming out from the

884
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:54,529
four feet of cable coming out from the
 

885
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,149
four feet of cable coming out from the
piece of PVC pipe that I ran so not a

886
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
piece of PVC pipe that I ran so not a
 

887
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,639
piece of PVC pipe that I ran so not a
lot of room to move around so rather

888
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:00,649
lot of room to move around so rather
 

889
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,519
lot of room to move around so rather
than getting a HDMI extender which are

890
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:03,529
than getting a HDMI extender which are
 

891
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,440
than getting a HDMI extender which are
like a hundred and fifty bucks each so

892
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,450
like a hundred and fifty bucks each so
 

893
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,940
like a hundred and fifty bucks each so
that would be you know times that by

894
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:06,950
that would be you know times that by
 

895
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,099
that would be you know times that by
four for the number of cameras we have

896
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:09,109
four for the number of cameras we have
 

897
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:11,200
four for the number of cameras we have
plus add another one for a laptop you

898
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,210
plus add another one for a laptop you
 

899
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,780
plus add another one for a laptop you
know it gets pretty expensive

900
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:12,790
know it gets pretty expensive
 

901
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,330
know it gets pretty expensive
so I thought what I would try is they've

902
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:15,340
so I thought what I would try is they've
 

903
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,460
so I thought what I would try is they've
got couplers for five bucks and it's

904
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:17,470
got couplers for five bucks and it's
 

905
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,140
got couplers for five bucks and it's
just an HDMI coupler that you plug into

906
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,150
just an HDMI coupler that you plug into
 

907
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,210
just an HDMI coupler that you plug into
one cable and then it allows you to plug

908
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:21,220
one cable and then it allows you to plug
 

909
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,000
one cable and then it allows you to plug
in another cable to extend it so I'm

910
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,010
in another cable to extend it so I'm
 

911
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:30,690
in another cable to extend it so I'm
gonna try that a longer cable oh oh you

912
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:30,700
gonna try that a longer cable oh oh you
 

913
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,570
gonna try that a longer cable oh oh you
could cut the PVC tube shorter so you

914
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:33,580
could cut the PVC tube shorter so you
 

915
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,520
could cut the PVC tube shorter so you
have more selecting okay I can't cuz I

916
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:35,530
have more selecting okay I can't cuz I
 

917
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,990
have more selecting okay I can't cuz I
don't have a difference I don't have a

918
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,000
don't have a difference I don't have a
 

919
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,240
don't have a difference I don't have a
way to and I don't have a contractor but

920
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,250
way to and I don't have a contractor but
 

921
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,470
way to and I don't have a contractor but
that's actually a good question Lance

922
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
that's actually a good question Lance
 

923
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
that's actually a good question Lance
man the reason is because each camera

924
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,450
man the reason is because each camera
 

925
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,140
man the reason is because each camera
has a different type of interface so

926
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,150
has a different type of interface so
 

927
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,930
has a different type of interface so
while the high-end cameras have the full

928
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:48,940
while the high-end cameras have the full
 

929
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,900
while the high-end cameras have the full
HDMI output a couple of our cameras have

930
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:51,910
HDMI output a couple of our cameras have
 

931
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,640
HDMI output a couple of our cameras have
micro HDMI okay so they're a very so I

932
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:56,650
micro HDMI okay so they're a very so I
 

933
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,440
micro HDMI okay so they're a very so I
want to have some kind of something in

934
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:58,450
want to have some kind of something in
 

935
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,720
want to have some kind of something in
the studio that I can plug into and I

936
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:00,730
the studio that I can plug into and I
 

937
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,040
the studio that I can plug into and I
don't think I don't think you're gonna

938
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,050
don't think I don't think you're gonna
 

939
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,050
don't think I don't think you're gonna
find a micro HDMI cable that will reach

940
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,060
find a micro HDMI cable that will reach
 

941
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,820
find a micro HDMI cable that will reach
that long and and there are thinner

942
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:05,830
that long and and there are thinner
 

943
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,580
that long and and there are thinner
cables so I don't think I think then do

944
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:08,590
cables so I don't think I think then do
 

945
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,920
cables so I don't think I think then do
much signal loss if you have a handsaw

946
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:10,930
much signal loss if you have a handsaw
 

947
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,890
much signal loss if you have a handsaw
you can cut PVC pipe with a hex which I

948
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:13,900
you can cut PVC pipe with a hex which I
 

949
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,600
you can cut PVC pipe with a hex which I
don't have and the hardware stores are

950
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:15,610
don't have and the hardware stores are
 

951
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:22,440
don't have and the hardware stores are
closed no I have a dremel somewhere and

952
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,450
closed no I have a dremel somewhere and
 

953
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,330
closed no I have a dremel somewhere and
I thought I'd use the Dremel to do it

954
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,340
I thought I'd use the Dremel to do it
 

955
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:32,910
I thought I'd use the Dremel to do it
but if you're patient I'm gonna have one

956
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:32,920
but if you're patient I'm gonna have one
 

957
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,780
but if you're patient I'm gonna have one
shoot up into my forehead aren't I yeah

958
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:36,790
shoot up into my forehead aren't I yeah
 

959
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,090
shoot up into my forehead aren't I yeah
I'll just have to wait it out what the

960
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,100
I'll just have to wait it out what the
 

961
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,470
I'll just have to wait it out what the
coupler is meant to just give me

962
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
coupler is meant to just give me
 

963
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,300
coupler is meant to just give me
something that I can plug into so what

964
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,310
something that I can plug into so what
 

965
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,500
something that I can plug into so what
sort of signal lost

966
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,510
sort of signal lost
 

967
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,060
sort of signal lost
what sort of signal laughing you're

968
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,070
what sort of signal laughing you're
 

969
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,500
what sort of signal laughing you're
gonna experience through those couplers

970
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:46,510
gonna experience through those couplers
 

971
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,420
gonna experience through those couplers
that's what I don't know that we're

972
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:48,430
that's what I don't know that we're
 

973
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,510
that's what I don't know that we're
talking RF frequencies here this is a

974
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
talking RF frequencies here this is a
 

975
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,210
talking RF frequencies here this is a
digital signal yeah okay okay so you're

976
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:54,220
digital signal yeah okay okay so you're
 

977
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:02,040
digital signal yeah okay okay so you're
probably how long an HDMI yes yeah and

978
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,050
probably how long an HDMI yes yeah and
 

979
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,570
probably how long an HDMI yes yeah and
you gotta start extending it with power

980
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:03,580
you gotta start extending it with power
 

981
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,750
you gotta start extending it with power
right so much like Ethernet if you go

982
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:06,760
right so much like Ethernet if you go
 

983
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,550
right so much like Ethernet if you go
over 600 feet or whatever you've got to

984
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:08,560
over 600 feet or whatever you've got to
 

985
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,690
over 600 feet or whatever you've got to
have an extender in there so yeah it's

986
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:12,700
have an extender in there so yeah it's
 

987
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,260
have an extender in there so yeah it's
gonna need if I go if I get signal loss

988
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,270
gonna need if I go if I get signal loss
 

989
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,630
gonna need if I go if I get signal loss
then I'll have to I'll have to use a

990
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
then I'll have to I'll have to use a
 

991
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,920
then I'll have to I'll have to use a
powered extender but there are only five

992
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:19,930
powered extender but there are only five
 

993
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,260
powered extender but there are only five
bucks for the for the passive ones so I

994
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,270
bucks for the for the passive ones so I
 

995
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,910
bucks for the for the passive ones so I
thought I'd try it it's worth or a

996
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:23,920
thought I'd try it it's worth or a
 

997
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,490
thought I'd try it it's worth or a
window test David

998
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:27,500
window test David
 

999
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,690
window test David
are you trying to go Robbie um well it's

1000
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:32,700
are you trying to go Robbie um well it's
 

1001
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,260
are you trying to go Robbie um well it's
a 25-footer to get into the studio and

1002
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,270
a 25-footer to get into the studio and
 

1003
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,870
a 25-footer to get into the studio and
then I got a do maybe another 10 15 feet

1004
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
then I got a do maybe another 10 15 feet
 

1005
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,120
then I got a do maybe another 10 15 feet
from there so I think it'll I think it

1006
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,130
from there so I think it'll I think it
 

1007
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,730
from there so I think it'll I think it
should work I'm hoping so it's that'd be

1008
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:43,740
should work I'm hoping so it's that'd be
 

1009
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,030
should work I'm hoping so it's that'd be
a really cheap and cheerful solution but

1010
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,040
a really cheap and cheerful solution but
 

1011
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,380
a really cheap and cheerful solution but
the cables that I have are like these

1012
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,390
the cables that I have are like these
 

1013
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,960
the cables that I have are like these
really thick woven ones right like the

1014
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:50,970
really thick woven ones right like the
 

1015
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,080
really thick woven ones right like the
25-footers really good really good solid

1016
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,090
25-footers really good really good solid
 

1017
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,590
25-footers really good really good solid
cables so those are what I want to

1018
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:56,600
cables so those are what I want to
 

1019
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,920
cables so those are what I want to
daisy-chain plug into a new thing that

1020
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:00,930
daisy-chain plug into a new thing that
 

1021
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:07,450
daisy-chain plug into a new thing that
one will be where you plug a USB 1/8 a

1022
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:07,460

 

1023
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:13,430

capillary they I love that I love the

1024
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
capillary they I love that I love the
 

1025
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,530

the Freudian slip that he calls it a

1026
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:15,540
the Freudian slip that he calls it a
 

1027
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,150
the Freudian slip that he calls it a

they make those 4 HDMI as well but
 

1031
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,110
they make those 4 HDMI as well but
that's what I'm talking about those are

1032
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,120
that's what I'm talking about those are
 

1033
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,750
that's what I'm talking about those are
about 150 bucks so I want to see if I

1034
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:26,760
about 150 bucks so I want to see if I
 

1035
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,170
about 150 bucks so I want to see if I
can use a cheap one first yeah is that a

1036
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,180
can use a cheap one first yeah is that a
 

1037
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:40,840
can use a cheap one first yeah is that a
USB extender to category 5 technology TV

those are brilliant those are such great
 

1041
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,750
those are brilliant those are such great
devices and that's exactly what I'm

1042
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:44,760
devices and that's exactly what I'm
 

1043
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,050
devices and that's exactly what I'm
looking at for the video but because our

1044
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,060
looking at for the video but because our
 

1045
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,750
looking at for the video but because our
cameras are 4k it's gonna you can't get

1046
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:50,760
cameras are 4k it's gonna you can't get
 

1047
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,360
cameras are 4k it's gonna you can't get
the cheap $40 ones those are only 1080p

1048
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,370
the cheap $40 ones those are only 1080p
 

1049
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,360
the cheap $40 ones those are only 1080p
so so I'm hoping the coupler will work

1050
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,370
so so I'm hoping the coupler will work
 

1051
