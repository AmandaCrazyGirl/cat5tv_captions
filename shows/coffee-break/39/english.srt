00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,070
tell me you don't have to figure out the
pixels for every character I don't think

316
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,080
pixels for every character I don't think
 

317
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,400
pixels for every character I don't think
so but I don't know I mean it would be

318
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,410
so but I don't know I mean it would be
 

319
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,470
so but I don't know I mean it would be
trivial for me to do it on on the

320
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
trivial for me to do it on on the
 

321
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,329
trivial for me to do it on on the
program that I demonstrated a while ago

322
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:44,339
program that I demonstrated a while ago
 

323
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,710
program that I demonstrated a while ago
that's got nothing to do with the phone

324
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:45,720
that's got nothing to do with the phone
 

325
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,519
that's got nothing to do with the phone
time that is just a test workbench to

326
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:49,529
time that is just a test workbench to
 

327
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,620
time that is just a test workbench to
prove that the arrays that I built the

328
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,630
prove that the arrays that I built the
 

329
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,079
prove that the arrays that I built the
arrays that I built actually work the

330
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:56,089
arrays that I built actually work the
 

331
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:01,070
arrays that I built actually work the
program still has to or the pine time

332
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,080
program still has to or the pine time
 

333
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,930
program still has to or the pine time
application still has to figure out how

334
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:05,940
application still has to figure out how
 

335
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,710
application still has to figure out how
to how to draw that text because from

336
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:09,720
to how to draw that text because from
 

337
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,880
to how to draw that text because from
what I could tell from the photos the

338
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:12,890
what I could tell from the photos the
 

339
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,180
what I could tell from the photos the
picture that that had the clock face on

340
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,190
picture that that had the clock face on
 

341
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,050
picture that that had the clock face on
it does not show any numerix on the on

342
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,060
it does not show any numerix on the on
 

343
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,970
it does not show any numerix on the on
the clock face at all I think they were

344
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:22,980
the clock face at all I think they were
 

345
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,150
the clock face at all I think they were
relying on the background to do that but

346
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
relying on the background to do that but
 

347
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,190
relying on the background to do that but
the background was all wind wonky I

348
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,200
the background was all wind wonky I
 

349
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:38,090
the background was all wind wonky I
don't know why the on the pine phone

350
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,100
don't know why the on the pine phone
 

351
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,030
don't know why the on the pine phone
there's an app called amazed fish and

352
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
there's an app called amazed fish and
 

353
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,760
there's an app called amazed fish and
it's a watch companion app or sailfish

354
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:43,770
it's a watch companion app or sailfish
 

355
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,150
it's a watch companion app or sailfish
OS which works on the pine foam

356
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,160
OS which works on the pine foam
 

357
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,200
OS which works on the pine foam
so that allows you're watching your

358
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,210
so that allows you're watching your
 

359
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,750
so that allows you're watching your
phone to talk to each other when you say

360
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
phone to talk to each other when you say
 

361
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,610
phone to talk to each other when you say
works on the pine phone are you saying

362
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:55,620
works on the pine phone are you saying
 

363
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,470
works on the pine phone are you saying
it's a separate effort you installed on

364
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:57,480
it's a separate effort you installed on
 

365
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,150
it's a separate effort you installed on
the pine phone right yeah it's a

366
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,160
the pine phone right yeah it's a
 

367
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,550
the pine phone right yeah it's a
separate app you install on sailfish OS

368
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:03,560

 

369
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,200

okay okay sailfish OS doesn't run on the

370
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,210
okay okay sailfish OS doesn't run on the
 

371
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,830
okay okay sailfish OS doesn't run on the
point I'm though no but I'm trying to

372
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:12,840
point I'm though no but I'm trying to
 

373
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,450
point I'm though no but I'm trying to
figure it is any component there's any

374
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,460
figure it is any component there's any
 

375
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,580
figure it is any component there's any
component of that actually do you take

376
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:16,590
component of that actually do you take
 

377
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,650
component of that actually do you take
any component of that and install it on

378
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:18,660
any component of that and install it on
 

379
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,870
any component of that and install it on
the pine time or no you still have to

380
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
the pine time or no you still have to
 

381
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,110
the pine time or no you still have to
write something for the point I'm I'm

382
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,120
write something for the point I'm I'm
 

383
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,250
write something for the point I'm I'm
sure that well let's see I don't know

384
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,260
sure that well let's see I don't know
 

385
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,590
sure that well let's see I don't know
exactly how the communication happens I

386
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:30,600
exactly how the communication happens I
 

387
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,940
exactly how the communication happens I
mean it happens over bluetooth obviously

388
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:31,950
mean it happens over bluetooth obviously
 

389
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,810
mean it happens over bluetooth obviously
but but I'm not sure what types of

390
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:35,820
but but I'm not sure what types of
 

391
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,850
but but I'm not sure what types of
messages are relayed between the two I

392
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:37,860
messages are relayed between the two I
 

393
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,950
messages are relayed between the two I
guess what I'm trying to understand

394
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:39,960
guess what I'm trying to understand
 

395
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,170
guess what I'm trying to understand
these the piece you're describing is

396
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,180
these the piece you're describing is
 

397
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,330
these the piece you're describing is
designed to run on the pine phone

398
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:44,340
designed to run on the pine phone
 

399
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,460
designed to run on the pine phone
correct right but nothing of that I'm

400
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:49,470
correct right but nothing of that I'm
 

401
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,290
correct right but nothing of that I'm
what I'm trying to understand is if any

402
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,300
what I'm trying to understand is if any
 

403
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,000
what I'm trying to understand is if any
part of that is supposed to be installed

404
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,010
part of that is supposed to be installed
 

405
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,180
part of that is supposed to be installed
on the pine time well I think if you're

406
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,190
on the pine time well I think if you're
 

407
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,730
on the pine time well I think if you're
writing your own pine time OS you would

408
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:58,740
writing your own pine time OS you would
 

409
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,800
writing your own pine time OS you would
have to process the messages that that

410
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:03,810
have to process the messages that that
 

411
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,770
have to process the messages that that
amazing fish would be sending to the

412
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:06,780
amazing fish would be sending to the
 

413
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,070
amazing fish would be sending to the
pine time for my for my initial attempt

414
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,080
pine time for my for my initial attempt
 

415
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,530
pine time for my for my initial attempt
I'm not planning to do any Bluetooth

416
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:12,540
I'm not planning to do any Bluetooth
 

417
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm not planning to do any Bluetooth
communication or anything like that the

418
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,850
communication or anything like that the
 

419
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,430
communication or anything like that the
way I've described it before is that my

420
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
way I've described it before is that my
 

421
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,950
way I've described it before is that my
plan would be to once I've got the watch

422
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:21,960
plan would be to once I've got the watch
 

423
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,220
plan would be to once I've got the watch
face up and running it would display

424
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,230
face up and running it would display
 

425
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,410
face up and running it would display
some default time typically the time it

426
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:27,420
some default time typically the time it
 

427
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,850
some default time typically the time it
was compiled and then you have to get e

428
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:31,860
was compiled and then you have to get e
 

429
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,770
was compiled and then you have to get e
to another screen like a setting screen

430
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:33,780
to another screen like a setting screen
 

431
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,990
to another screen like a setting screen
to adjust the time once it's adjusted

432
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
to adjust the time once it's adjusted
 

433
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,500
to adjust the time once it's adjusted
and you've updated the the real time

434
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:39,510
and you've updated the the real time
 

435
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,950
and you've updated the the real time
clock the so called real time clock in

436
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:42,960
clock the so called real time clock in
 

437
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,040
clock the so called real time clock in
the in the pine term itself then the

438
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,050
the in the pine term itself then the
 

439
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,600
the in the pine term itself then the
pine time should just keep running

440
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:47,610
pine time should just keep running
 

441
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,280
pine time should just keep running
whether it whether the screen is on or

442
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,290
whether it whether the screen is on or
 

443
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,320
whether it whether the screen is on or
not the phone time should just keep

444
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,330
not the phone time should just keep
 

445
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,700
not the phone time should just keep
running and it should just keep track at

446
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:55,710
running and it should just keep track at
 

447
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,800
running and it should just keep track at
the time at that point without any

448
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:57,810
the time at that point without any
 

449
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,740
the time at that point without any
further intervention so it just kept you

450
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:00,750
further intervention so it just kept you
 

451
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,680
further intervention so it just kept you
say again I just count Jeffy's wouldn't

452
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:04,690
say again I just count Jeffy's wouldn't
 

453
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,480
say again I just count Jeffy's wouldn't
it just count the number Jeff uses no

454
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,490
it just count the number Jeff uses no
 

455
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,560
it just count the number Jeff uses no
differencing there is actually a clock a

456
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:12,570

 

457
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,740

effectively a crystal but a device it's

458
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,750
effectively a crystal but a device it's
 

459
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,319
effectively a crystal but a device it's
not really a real-time clock though it

460
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:19,329
not really a real-time clock though it
 

461
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,360
not really a real-time clock though it
is actually just a ticker something that

462
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,370
is actually just a ticker something that
 

463
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,880
is actually just a ticker something that
ticks literally every thirty two

464
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:23,890
ticks literally every thirty two
 

465
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,910
ticks literally every thirty two
thousand thirty two thousand times every

466
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:26,920
thousand thirty two thousand times every
 

467
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,550
thousand thirty two thousand times every
second or something and once you set the

468
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:29,560
second or something and once you set the
 

469
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,150

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
our transcoders go through all the files
 

785
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,840
our transcoders go through all the files
and everything but having done the show

786
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:42,850
and everything but having done the show
 

787
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,850
and everything but having done the show
on Wednesday and having published it on

788
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:44,860
on Wednesday and having published it on
 

789
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,820
on Wednesday and having published it on
Monday I realized that the website was

790
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:47,830
Monday I realized that the website was
 

791
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,850
Monday I realized that the website was
still only showing up to 1080p so I

792
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:50,860
still only showing up to 1080p so I
 

793
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,640
still only showing up to 1080p so I
thought oh I'd like to add the 1440p

794
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:53,650
thought oh I'd like to add the 1440p
 

795
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,510
thought oh I'd like to add the 1440p
feature as well 2k video and so I went

796
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
feature as well 2k video and so I went
 

797
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,370
feature as well 2k video and so I went
into the law logged into the backend of

798
00:24:59,370 --> 00:24:59,380
into the law logged into the backend of
 

799
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,860
into the law logged into the backend of
Vimeo and the highest resolution in the

800
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:01,870
Vimeo and the highest resolution in the
 

801
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,300
Vimeo and the highest resolution in the
backend is 1080p so I did a quick step

802
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,310
backend is 1080p so I did a quick step
 

803
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:13,260
backend is 1080p so I did a quick step
up bad well not bad but not 2k I know

804
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,270
up bad well not bad but not 2k I know
 

805
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,030
up bad well not bad but not 2k I know
but I'm thinking of all the countries

806
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,040
but I'm thinking of all the countries
 

807
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,650
but I'm thinking of all the countries
and stuff with metered access and all

808
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:16,660
and stuff with metered access and all
 

809
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,270
and stuff with metered access and all
the other stuff where it is easy to

810
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,280
the other stuff where it is easy to
 

811
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,740
the other stuff where it is easy to
stream it well we stream in HLS so it'll

812
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:22,750
stream it well we stream in HLS so it'll
 

813
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,030
stream it well we stream in HLS so it'll
automatically clock down okay but but as

814
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,040
automatically clock down okay but but as
 

815
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,890
automatically clock down okay but but as
far as the direct downloads because if

816
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:28,900
far as the direct downloads because if
 

817
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,590
far as the direct downloads because if
you go to any episode of category 5 even

818
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
you go to any episode of category 5 even
 

819
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,390
you go to any episode of category 5 even
the coffee break you can you can click

820
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:33,400
the coffee break you can you can click
 

821
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,740
the coffee break you can you can click
on the download button and download it

822
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:34,750
on the download button and download it
 

823
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,130
on the download button and download it
to your hard drive so it makes sense to

824
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,140
to your hard drive so it makes sense to
 

825
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,030
to your hard drive so it makes sense to
have the highest rebel but so I did a

826
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,040
have the highest rebel but so I did a
 

827
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,400
have the highest rebel but so I did a
quick search and turns out they do store

828
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,410
quick search and turns out they do store
 

829
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,430
quick search and turns out they do store
the 1440p files but they don't make them

830
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
the 1440p files but they don't make them
 

831
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,250
the 1440p files but they don't make them
publicly accessible on the on the

832
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:50,260
publicly accessible on the on the
 

833
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,070
publicly accessible on the on the
dashboard you have to be a developer

834
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,080
dashboard you have to be a developer
 

835
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,650
dashboard you have to be a developer
they say so I guess they're like weeding

836
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:55,660
they say so I guess they're like weeding
 

837
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,440
they say so I guess they're like weeding
out so they're testing yeah they're like

838
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,450
out so they're testing yeah they're like
 

839
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,200
out so they're testing yeah they're like
testing whether you're good enough to

840
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,210
testing whether you're good enough to
 

841
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,450
testing whether you're good enough to
have access to the big files so so I

842
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:03,460
have access to the big files so so I
 

843
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,130
have access to the big files so so I
took a look at that last night and sure

844
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,140
took a look at that last night and sure
 

845
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,810
took a look at that last night and sure
enough I already wrote the program to do

846
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:06,820
enough I already wrote the program to do
 

847
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,210
enough I already wrote the program to do
in PHP didn't yeah

848
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:10,220
in PHP didn't yeah
 

849
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:23,560
in PHP didn't yeah
[Laughter]

850
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:23,570

 

851
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,090

and it runs great so it goes through my

852
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,100
and it runs great so it goes through my
 

853
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,950
and it runs great so it goes through my
database and it finds all the missing

854
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:27,960
database and it finds all the missing
 

855
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,990
database and it finds all the missing
all the missing files that Vimeo has

856
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
all the missing files that Vimeo has
 

857
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,880
all the missing files that Vimeo has
that our database doesn't have in it

858
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,890
that our database doesn't have in it
 

859
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,940
that our database doesn't have in it
automatically so I'm going to be testing

860
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:34,950
automatically so I'm going to be testing
 

861
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,470
automatically so I'm going to be testing
that over the next couple of days

862
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
that over the next couple of days
 

863
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,000
that over the next couple of days
it's gonna run through our database and

864
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,010
it's gonna run through our database and
 

865
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,860
it's gonna run through our database and
we re download all of the files and then

866
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:42,870
we re download all of the files and then
 

867
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,960
we re download all of the files and then
you're gonna run that at your at the

868
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:44,970
you're gonna run that at your at the
 

869
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,670
you're gonna run that at your at the
studio right where you have a nice thick

870
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:46,680
studio right where you have a nice thick
 

871
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,110
studio right where you have a nice thick
oh no no no I have a I have a 100 over

872
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
oh no no no I have a I have a 100 over
 

873
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,240
oh no no no I have a I have a 100 over
100 fiber line at the colocation

874
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,250
100 fiber line at the colocation
 

875
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:59,270
100 fiber line at the colocation
facility that's donated to us Wow which

876
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,280
facility that's donated to us Wow which
 

877
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,480
facility that's donated to us Wow which
which has always been you know it's like

878
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,490
which has always been you know it's like
 

879
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,420
which has always been you know it's like
I wish I could have that at Studio yeah

880
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:05,430
I wish I could have that at Studio yeah
 

881
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,970
I wish I could have that at Studio yeah
no it's colocation so that's where our

882
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:07,980
no it's colocation so that's where our
 

883
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,640
no it's colocation so that's where our
actual server and our backups are so

884
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:10,650
actual server and our backups are so
 

885
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,250
actual server and our backups are so
mm-hmm so when you're watching the show

886
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:13,260
mm-hmm so when you're watching the show
 

887
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,990
mm-hmm so when you're watching the show
live you're streaming it from that

888
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,000
live you're streaming it from that
 

889
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,830
live you're streaming it from that
colocation facility I always wondered

890
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:18,840
colocation facility I always wondered
 

891
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
colocation facility I always wondered
about that have had the video especially

892
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:20,850
about that have had the video especially
 

893
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,140
about that have had the video especially
with the high volume folks like do you

894
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,150
with the high volume folks like do you
 

895
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,630
with the high volume folks like do you
know Netflix and an Amazon Prime and all

896
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
know Netflix and an Amazon Prime and all
 

897
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,720
know Netflix and an Amazon Prime and all
that how they split the video and split

898
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:29,730
that how they split the video and split
 

899
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,690
that how they split the video and split
it and split it so it can be shared that

900
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:32,700
it and split it so it can be shared that
 

901
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,420
it and split it so it can be shared that
way with that huge Amanda Network

902
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:35,430
way with that huge Amanda Network
 

903
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,040
way with that huge Amanda Network
latency I mean I wouldn't even know

904
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,050
latency I mean I wouldn't even know
 

905
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,330
latency I mean I wouldn't even know
where to start with something like that

906
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:38,340
where to start with something like that
 

907
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,540
where to start with something like that
it's twofold it's between HLS for the

908
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:41,550
it's twofold it's between HLS for the
 

909
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,880
it's twofold it's between HLS for the
for the bandwidth control so that's what

910
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:43,890
for the bandwidth control so that's what
 

911
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,650
for the bandwidth control so that's what
makes it so that it will automatically

912
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:45,660
makes it so that it will automatically
 

913
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,240
makes it so that it will automatically
change the bitrate

914
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,250
change the bitrate
 

915
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,240
change the bitrate
yep so that's HLS and then the second

916
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,250
yep so that's HLS and then the second
 

917
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,550
yep so that's HLS and then the second
factor is nimble streamer and nimble

918
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:55,560
factor is nimble streamer and nimble
 

919
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,980
factor is nimble streamer and nimble
streamer is what allows us to do YouTube

920
00:27:59,980 --> 00:27:59,990
streamer is what allows us to do YouTube
 

921
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:05,630
streamer is what allows us to do YouTube
Facebook Roku all simultaneously but I'm

922
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:05,640
Facebook Roku all simultaneously but I'm
 

923
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,570
Facebook Roku all simultaneously but I'm
on I'm only sending a single feed to the

924
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:08,580
on I'm only sending a single feed to the
 

925
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,700
on I'm only sending a single feed to the
nimble streamer serve noise and then

926
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:10,710
nimble streamer serve noise and then
 

927
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,460
nimble streamer serve noise and then
they want about the virtual machines for

928
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:13,470
they want about the virtual machines for
 

929
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,860
they want about the virtual machines for
each format well essentially I mean it's

930
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:15,870
each format well essentially I mean it's
 

931
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,350
each format well essentially I mean it's
it's it splits it up into separate feeds

932
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:18,360
it's it splits it up into separate feeds
 

933
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,960
it's it splits it up into separate feeds
to all the different supported platforms

934
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:20,970
to all the different supported platforms
 

935
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,820
to all the different supported platforms
so

936
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:22,830
so
 

937
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,360
so
it sends it to them in HLS formats at
