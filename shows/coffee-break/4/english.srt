in place Internet is meant to be

384
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
in place Internet is meant to be
 

385
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,069
in place Internet is meant to be
installed on Thursday so that's kind of

386
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:57,079
installed on Thursday so that's kind of
 

387
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:57,460
installed on Thursday so that's kind of
cool

388
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:57,470
cool
 

389
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,500
cool
so I wanted to have that in place before

390
00:10:59,500 --> 00:10:59,510
so I wanted to have that in place before
 

391
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,990
so I wanted to have that in place before
we moved because then we can do vlogs

392
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
we moved because then we can do vlogs
 

393
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,389
we moved because then we can do vlogs
and stuff from there maybe a zoom for

394
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
and stuff from there maybe a zoom for
 

395
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,870
and stuff from there maybe a zoom for
the Kickstarter supporters and that can

396
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
the Kickstarter supporters and that can
 

397
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,790
the Kickstarter supporters and that can
five already cable what's that's all boo

398
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,800
five already cable what's that's all boo
 

399
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,560
five already cable what's that's all boo
what kind of connection you get it's

400
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:17,570
what kind of connection you get it's
 

401
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,530
what kind of connection you get it's
gonna be 50 up and a gig down yeah

402
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:23,540
gonna be 50 up and a gig down yeah
 

403
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,660
gonna be 50 up and a gig down yeah
it also has LTE failover so if our

404
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:25,670
it also has LTE failover so if our
 

405
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,870
it also has LTE failover so if our
internet goes down we've got the LTE to

406
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
internet goes down we've got the LTE to
 

407
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,689
internet goes down we've got the LTE to
broadcast over and we don't have to pay

408
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:31,699
broadcast over and we don't have to pay
 

409
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,400
broadcast over and we don't have to pay
you don't have to pay extra for the

410
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,410
you don't have to pay extra for the
 

411
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,249
you don't have to pay extra for the
bandwidth that's actually provided as a

412
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:35,259
bandwidth that's actually provided as a
 

413
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:41,470
bandwidth that's actually provided as a
failover service from the ISP whole new

414
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:41,480
failover service from the ISP whole new
 

415
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,900
failover service from the ISP whole new
world for category five that's for sure

416
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:45,910

 

417
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,579

yeah no more downtime but also like no

418
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:48,589
yeah no more downtime but also like no
 

419
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:50,710
yeah no more downtime but also like no
more having to downscale the 720 for our

420
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
more having to downscale the 720 for our
 

421
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,569
more having to downscale the 720 for our
live feed like I'm I'm pretty confident

422
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:52,579
live feed like I'm I'm pretty confident
 

423
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,819
live feed like I'm I'm pretty confident
we'll be able to do at least 1080p we

424
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:54,829
we'll be able to do at least 1080p we
 

425
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,009
we'll be able to do at least 1080p we
may be able to even go to K if we're

426
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:57,019
may be able to even go to K if we're
 

427
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:01,389
may be able to even go to K if we're
lucky so Oh we'll see so I don't I don't

428
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:01,399
lucky so Oh we'll see so I don't I don't
 

429
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,620
lucky so Oh we'll see so I don't I don't
I've never done that so I don't know

430
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:02,630
I've never done that so I don't know
 

431
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,540
I've never done that so I don't know
what kind of latency that introduces but

432
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:04,550
what kind of latency that introduces but
 

433
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,879
what kind of latency that introduces but
I suspect you know Google that has

434
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:06,889
I suspect you know Google that has
 

435
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,360
I suspect you know Google that has
really good low latency transcoders so I

436
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,370
really good low latency transcoders so I
 

437
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,980
really good low latency transcoders so I
think it should yeah the latency on

438
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,990
think it should yeah the latency on
 

439
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,600
think it should yeah the latency on
streaming sites way down the national TV

440
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:19,610
streaming sites way down the national TV
 

441
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,870
streaming sites way down the national TV
and my latency was about I mean it's it

442
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
and my latency was about I mean it's it
 

443
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:31,030
and my latency was about I mean it's it
after I came here 15 seconds wow I don't

444
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
after I came here 15 seconds wow I don't
 

445
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,410
after I came here 15 seconds wow I don't
think we've ever been that bad like

446
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:32,420
think we've ever been that bad like
 

447
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,860
think we've ever been that bad like
we're what about 20 30 seconds guys yeah

448
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:35,870
we're what about 20 30 seconds guys yeah
 

449
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,079
we're what about 20 30 seconds guys yeah
if you're watching live then it's on the

450
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:38,089
if you're watching live then it's on the
 

451
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,680
if you're watching live then it's on the
platform yeah yeah I guess so Roku is

452
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:41,690
platform yeah yeah I guess so Roku is
 

453
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,569
platform yeah yeah I guess so Roku is
much worse oh really

454
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:43,579
much worse oh really
 

455
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:47,910
much worse oh really
yeah what Roku model do you have bill

459
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,309
you know the top of the line oh yeah
like the current the current one okay

460
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:54,319
like the current the current one okay
 

461
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:58,480
like the current the current one okay
yeah that's surprising no I use ice I

462
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,490
yeah that's surprising no I use ice I
 

463
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,610
yeah that's surprising no I use ice I
still do the development on an old Roku

464
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:00,620
still do the development on an old Roku
 

465
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,490
still do the development on an old Roku
2 and I had thought and it's really slow

466
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:03,500
2 and I had thought and it's really slow
 

467
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,530
2 and I had thought and it's really slow
and so I thought about upgrading to a

468
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:05,540
and so I thought about upgrading to a
 

469
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,679
and so I thought about upgrading to a
more current one yeah because it still

470
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:08,689
more current one yeah because it still
 

471
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:09,160
more current one yeah because it still
works

472
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,170
works
 

473
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,540
works
yeah Roku makes any difference I think

474
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:13,550
yeah Roku makes any difference I think
 

475
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,319
yeah Roku makes any difference I think
it's just streaming streaming path but I

476
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:17,329
it's just streaming streaming path but I
 

477
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,150
it's just streaming streaming path but I
have a Roku 3 and I see probably

478
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
have a Roku 3 and I see probably
 

479
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,129
have a Roku 3 and I see probably
a 40 second delay from when from when I

480
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:25,139
a 40 second delay from when from when I
 

481
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,749
a 40 second delay from when from when I
say something a pig when I touch

482
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:26,759
say something a pig when I touch
 

483
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,360
say something a pig when I touch
something on the discord chat

484
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,370
something on the discord chat
 

485
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,730
something on the discord chat
yeah takes at least 30 or 40 seconds

486
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:31,740
yeah takes at least 30 or 40 seconds
 

487
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,970
yeah takes at least 30 or 40 seconds
before the peers right I'm gonna string

488
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:34,980
before the peers right I'm gonna string
 

489
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,920
before the peers right I'm gonna string
you you know what would be an

490
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:36,930
you you know what would be an
 

491
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,009
you you know what would be an
interesting go ahead sorry that what I

492
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:40,019
interesting go ahead sorry that what I
 

493
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,269
interesting go ahead sorry that what I
was thinking is it would be an

494
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
was thinking is it would be an
 

495
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,170
was thinking is it would be an
interesting test to bring up Cody and

496
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,180
interesting test to bring up Cody and
 

497
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,480
interesting test to bring up Cody and
Roku at the same time and see what the

498
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,490
Roku at the same time and see what the
 

499
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,189
Roku at the same time and see what the
latency difference is because those are

500
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:52,199
latency difference is because those are
 

501
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,050
latency difference is because those are
actually feeding from the same HLS

502
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,060
actually feeding from the same HLS
 

503
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,249
actually feeding from the same HLS
server so if if it is in fact the stream

504
00:13:58,249 --> 00:13:58,259
server so if if it is in fact the stream
 

505
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,910
server so if if it is in fact the stream
it will probably be pretty well synced

506
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:00,920
it will probably be pretty well synced
 

507
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,530
it will probably be pretty well synced
if it's the Roku device or their

508
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
if it's the Roku device or their
 

509
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
if it's the Roku device or their
platform then that would tell us if it's

510
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:05,550
platform then that would tell us if it's
 

511
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,850
platform then that would tell us if it's
maybe something in that platform that

512
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:07,860
maybe something in that platform that
 

513
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,319
maybe something in that platform that
causes the delay maybe they have more

514
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:09,329
causes the delay maybe they have more
 

515
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,999
causes the delay maybe they have more
mustering or something YouTube on the

516
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:11,009
mustering or something YouTube on the
 

517
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:13,309
mustering or something YouTube on the
other hand bill is is a completely

518
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:13,319
other hand bill is is a completely
 

519
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,559
other hand bill is is a completely
separate feed we actually send directly

520
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:15,569
separate feed we actually send directly
 

521
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:18,079
separate feed we actually send directly
to them yeah that's that's about 15 to

522
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,089
to them yeah that's that's about 15 to
 

523
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,689
to them yeah that's that's about 15 to
20 seconds yeah that's that's incredible

524
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:20,699
20 seconds yeah that's that's incredible
 

525
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,850
20 seconds yeah that's that's incredible
yeah I mean considering we are sending

526
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:22,860
yeah I mean considering we are sending
 

527
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,970
yeah I mean considering we are sending
HD video and they're transcoding it down

528
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:25,980
HD video and they're transcoding it down
 

529
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,620
HD video and they're transcoding it down
to 320 and 240 and 480 and so that's

530
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:30,630
to 320 and 240 and 480 and so that's
 

531
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,319
to 320 and 240 and 480 and so that's
pretty good it amazed me when I first

532
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:33,329
pretty good it amazed me when I first
 

533
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:37,100
pretty good it amazed me when I first
got DSL which wasn't very fast at the

534
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,110
got DSL which wasn't very fast at the
 

535
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,280
got DSL which wasn't very fast at the
time I was able to do a ping to a

536
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,290
time I was able to do a ping to a
 

537
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,470
time I was able to do a ping to a
website back in Australia and get a

538
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
website back in Australia and get a
 

539
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,809
website back in Australia and get a
response around time response with less

540
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:44,819
response around time response with less
 

541
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,519
response around time response with less
than a second and I couldn't believe it

542
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:46,529
than a second and I couldn't believe it
 

543
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,720
than a second and I couldn't believe it
yeah blown you know yeah and here we are

554
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:01,439
do there's looking and there's what the
 

555
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:04,220
do there's looking and there's what the
feed looks like so that's the feed from

556
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,230
feed looks like so that's the feed from
 

557
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,210
feed looks like so that's the feed from
my perspective and then I've got my

558
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,220
my perspective and then I've got my
 

559
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,829

dude I did I did kind of go through it

576
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:33,720
dude I did I did kind of go through it
 

577
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,390
dude I did I did kind of go through it
but you probably have a really good

578
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,400
but you probably have a really good
 

579
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,070
but you probably have a really good
perspective on this now I've been using

580
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,080
perspective on this now I've been using
 

581
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,050
perspective on this now I've been using
it as kind of a remote terminal and sew

582
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,060
it as kind of a remote terminal and sew
 

583
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,310
it as kind of a remote terminal and sew
it and it works fabulous for that yeah

584
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
it and it works fabulous for that yeah
 

585
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,580
it and it works fabulous for that yeah
yeah I rarely use it as a as its own

586
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,590
yeah I rarely use it as a as its own
 

587
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,020
yeah I rarely use it as a as its own
standalone just because I I I'm very

588
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,030
standalone just because I I I'm very
 

589
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,280
standalone just because I I I'm very
much a like a cloud-based worker so none

00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,290
much a like a cloud-based worker so none
 

591
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,250

00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,260
of my devices have like this device
 

593
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,440
of my devices have like this device
doesn't have any files on it and if my

laptop breaks that says that's why I'm
 

597
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,950
laptop breaks that says that's why I'm
able to recover so quickly anytime I

00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:03,960
able to recover so quickly anytime I
 

599
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,320
able to recover so quickly anytime I
have a computer crash or something I

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,330
have a computer crash or something I
 

601
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,150
have a computer crash or something I
don't I don't really use the device

602
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
don't I don't really use the device
 

603
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,760
don't I don't really use the device
itself other than as a remote terminal

604
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:09,770
itself other than as a remote terminal
 

605
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,940
itself other than as a remote terminal
so for what I'm using it for which is

606
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:13,950
so for what I'm using it for which is
 

607
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,910
so for what I'm using it for which is
basically Google remote desktop into an

608
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:16,920
basically Google remote desktop into an
 

609
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,910
basically Google remote desktop into an
i-9 9900 K it operates as a screamin

610
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:22,920
i-9 9900 K it operates as a screamin
 

611
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,310
i-9 9900 K it operates as a screamin
little device so I can do my video

612
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,320
little device so I can do my video
 

613
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,380
little device so I can do my video
editing and everything on it because I'm

614
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,390
editing and everything on it because I'm
 

615
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,380
editing and everything on it because I'm
doing it remotely to the to the server

616
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:29,390
doing it remotely to the to the server
 

617
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,330
doing it remotely to the to the server
but does it standalone but I use it for

618
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,340
but does it standalone but I use it for
 

619
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,940
but does it standalone but I use it for
general stuff like just surfing the web

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:34,950
general stuff like just surfing the web
 

621

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,450
and uploading videos to YouTube and
stuff like that

624
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,460
stuff like that
 

625
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,750
stuff like that
the webcam is is pretty miserable but I

626
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:41,760
the webcam is is pretty miserable but I
 

627
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,400
the webcam is is pretty miserable but I
mean what do you expect it's not it

628
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,410
mean what do you expect it's not it
 

629
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,440
mean what do you expect it's not it
doesn't need to be good it's just it's a

630
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,450
doesn't need to be good it's just it's a
 

631
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,510
doesn't need to be good it's just it's a
convenience thing right it's definitely

632
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:47,520
convenience thing right it's definitely
 

633
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,080
convenience thing right it's definitely
worth it oh definitely oh for 200 bucks

634
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,090
worth it oh definitely oh for 200 bucks
 

635
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,000
worth it oh definitely oh for 200 bucks
yeah just be careful with it it's really

636
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,010
yeah just be careful with it it's really
 

637
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,680
yeah just be careful with it it's really
thin which gives it that really nice

638
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:54,690
thin which gives it that really nice
 

639
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,780
thin which gives it that really nice
sleek look but it also makes the plastic

640
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:56,790
sleek look but it also makes the plastic
 

641
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,780
sleek look but it also makes the plastic
pretty pretty you know you could see

642
00:16:59,780 --> 00:16:59,790
pretty pretty you know you could see
 

643
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,070
pretty pretty you know you could see
that it you could crack it if you

644
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,080
that it you could crack it if you
 

645
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,990
that it you could crack it if you
weren't careful it is maybe not

646
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
weren't careful it is maybe not
 

647
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,870
weren't careful it is maybe not
recommended but again Sabu who's gonna

648
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
recommended but again Sabu who's gonna
 

649
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
recommended but again Sabu who's gonna
do that right that's not the intention

650
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:10,650
do that right that's not the intention
 

651
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,280
do that right that's not the intention
behind the device yeah you would yeah

652
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,290
behind the device yeah you would yeah
 

653
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,380
behind the device yeah you would yeah
you're you're you have way too much time

654
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,390
you're you're you have way too much time
 

655
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,420
you're you're you have way too much time
on your hands anything

656
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,430

 

657
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:26,220

but anytime I do compiling in a few

658
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,230
but anytime I do compiling in a few
 

659
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,670
but anytime I do compiling in a few
times a week yeah but but you would set

660
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:29,680
times a week yeah but but you would set
 

661
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,770
times a week yeah but but you would set
up with like a little i7 or something

662
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:31,780
up with like a little i7 or something
 

663
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,870
up with like a little i7 or something
that you can just fire on whenever you

664
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:33,880
that you can just fire on whenever you
 

665
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,730
that you can just fire on whenever you
need to do compiling and then you would

666
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:35,740
need to do compiling and then you would
 

667
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,250
need to do compiling and then you would
just throw your code on it and start to

668
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:38,260
just throw your code on it and start to
 

669
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,680
just throw your code on it and start to
compile it's like how I I render 2k

670
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:40,690
compile it's like how I I render 2k
 

671
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,260
compile it's like how I I render 2k
video from my pine Book Pro but I'm

672
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,270
video from my pine Book Pro but I'm
 

673
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,540
video from my pine Book Pro but I'm
connecting to an i-9 with MDOT to

674
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:45,550
connecting to an i-9 with MDOT to
 

675
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,960
connecting to an i-9 with MDOT to
storage right sorry what's that storm

676
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:51,970
storage right sorry what's that storm
 

677
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,670
storage right sorry what's that storm
chaser so you mean like cross

678
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:53,680
chaser so you mean like cross
 

679
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,350
chaser so you mean like cross
architecture compiling or something like

680
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
architecture compiling or something like
 

681
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,790
architecture compiling or something like
that you just throw it on the more

682
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:56,800
that you just throw it on the more
 

683
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,920
that you just throw it on the more
powerful machine and cross compile it to

684
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:58,930
powerful machine and cross compile it to
 

685
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,950
powerful machine and cross compile it to
the arm 6 aar 64 architecture and then

686
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:01,960
the arm 6 aar 64 architecture and then
 

687
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,670
the arm 6 aar 64 architecture and then
load it back onto your pine book or yeah

688
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:05,680
load it back onto your pine book or yeah
 

689
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,960
load it back onto your pine book or yeah
you could like if you're compiling

690
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:06,970
you could like if you're compiling
 

691
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,550
you could like if you're compiling
software that's a little different right

692
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:11,560
software that's a little different right
 

693
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:20,400
software that's a little different right
on the pine book sorry maybe I

694
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,410
on the pine book sorry maybe I
 

695
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,860
on the pine book sorry maybe I
misunderstood like certainly when I like

696
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:22,870
misunderstood like certainly when I like
 

697
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,870
misunderstood like certainly when I like
when I create MEMS Linux for example I

698
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
when I create MEMS Linux for example I
 

699
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,780
when I create MEMS Linux for example I
actually use each device to compile

700
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:27,790
actually use each device to compile
 

701
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,450
actually use each device to compile
itself to compile the software otherwise

702
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:30,460
itself to compile the software otherwise
 

703
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,550
itself to compile the software otherwise
it like so it's time-consuming unlike

704
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:32,560
it like so it's time-consuming unlike
 

705
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,670
it like so it's time-consuming unlike
the PI 0 but oh yeah it's worth it

706
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:35,680
the PI 0 but oh yeah it's worth it
 

707
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,440
the PI 0 but oh yeah it's worth it
because you know that the software is

708
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,450
because you know that the software is
 

709
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,910
because you know that the software is
gonna be perfectly compiled for that

710
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:38,920
gonna be perfectly compiled for that
 

711
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,180
gonna be perfectly compiled for that
architecture and that hardware so in the

712
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,190
architecture and that hardware so in the
 

713
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,430
architecture and that hardware so in the
do so that but I compile for we have I

714
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,440
do so that but I compile for we have I
 

715
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,380
do so that but I compile for we have I
think we have two arm architectures that

716
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,390
think we have two arm architectures that
 

717
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,830
think we have two arm architectures that
support someone donated of your devices

718
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
support someone donated of your devices
 

719
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,520
support someone donated of your devices
yeah and compiling is something that

720
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,530
yeah and compiling is something that
 

721
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,750
yeah and compiling is something that
takes an hour on a regular like it takes

722
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
takes an hour on a regular like it takes
 

723
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,630
takes an hour on a regular like it takes
zero four days that's crazy

724
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
zero four days that's crazy
 

725
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,520
zero four days that's crazy
so be what I would do in this case if

726
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,530
so be what I would do in this case if
 

727
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,360
so be what I would do in this case if
you wanted to use pine Book Pro for like

728
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,370
you wanted to use pine Book Pro for like
 

729
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,670
you wanted to use pine Book Pro for like
software generation is I would get a

730
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:08,680
software generation is I would get a
 

731
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,380
software generation is I would get a
Rock Pro 64 which is the same exact SBC

732
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,390
Rock Pro 64 which is the same exact SBC
 

733
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,720
Rock Pro 64 which is the same exact SBC
just a different form factor they just

734
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:15,730
just a different form factor they just
 

735
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,100
just a different form factor they just
kind of flatten it out for the notebook

736
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,110
kind of flatten it out for the notebook
 

737
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,550
kind of flatten it out for the notebook
you could compile on the rock pro 64

738
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:20,560
you could compile on the rock pro 64
 

739
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,500
you could compile on the rock pro 64
separate from your pine Book Pro and

740
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:22,510
separate from your pine Book Pro and
 

741
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,720
separate from your pine Book Pro and
then you just transfer the software onto

742
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:24,730
then you just transfer the software onto
 

743
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,330
then you just transfer the software onto
the pine Book Pro and then and then

744
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:27,340
the pine Book Pro and then and then
 

745
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,190
the pine Book Pro and then and then
you're not let you're not using the

746
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
you're not let you're not using the
 

747
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,940
you're not let you're not using the
laptop to do all your compiling

748
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:31,950
laptop to do all your compiling
 

749
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,860
laptop to do all your compiling
you still get hard software that's

750
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,870
you still get hard software that's
 

751
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,779
you still get hard software that's
compiled for that hardware might be a

752
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:35,789
compiled for that hardware might be a
 

753
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:38,389
compiled for that hardware might be a
fun way to do it so another thing that I

754
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:38,399
fun way to do it so another thing that I
 

755
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:39,889
fun way to do it so another thing that I
do as well

756
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:39,899
do as well
 

757
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,730
do as well
apart from compiling is I do a lot of

758
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:43,740
apart from compiling is I do a lot of
 

759
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,240
apart from compiling is I do a lot of
writing in a using the the Tex text

760
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,250
writing in a using the the Tex text
 

761
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,519
writing in a using the the Tex text
formatting language so what also known

762
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:52,529
formatting language so what also known
 

763
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,019
formatting language so what also known
as latex or latex tui it's all pure text

764
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:57,029
as latex or latex tui it's all pure text
 

765
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,930
as latex or latex tui it's all pure text
so it's really easy to version control

766
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:58,940
so it's really easy to version control
 

767
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,370
so it's really easy to version control
with some house meat or whatever you've

768
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:01,380
with some house meat or whatever you've
 

769
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,840
with some house meat or whatever you've
got and that's one of the reasons I like

770
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:02,850
got and that's one of the reasons I like
 

771
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,960
got and that's one of the reasons I like
it it has no trouble of even even the

772
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:05,970
it it has no trouble of even even the
 

773
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,480
it it has no trouble of even even the
pine book not the probe the phone book

774
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:08,490
pine book not the probe the phone book
 

775
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,509
pine book not the probe the phone book
has no trouble at all railing yeah

776
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:11,519
has no trouble at all railing yeah
 

777
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,889
has no trouble at all railing yeah
absolutely yeah what I do have a problem

778
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:15,899

an open-source game streaming thing so

808
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:57,690
an open-source game streaming thing so
 

809
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,009
an open-source game streaming thing so
basically you have a computer with an

810
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,019
basically you have a computer with an
 

811
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:04,070
basically you have a computer with an
Nvidia graphics card above with GTN 600

812
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
Nvidia graphics card above with GTN 600
 

813
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,769
Nvidia graphics card above with GTN 600
and then you and then you stream that to

814
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:06,779
and then you and then you stream that to
 

815
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,230
and then you and then you stream that to
any computer even remotely so you can

816
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,240
any computer even remotely so you can
 

817
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,210
any computer even remotely so you can
like not be at home where your computer

818
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,220
like not be at home where your computer
 

819
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,860
like not be at home where your computer
is and you can still stream it there so

820
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:12,870
is and you can still stream it there so
 

821
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,940
is and you can still stream it there so
you could do that I'm pretty sure you

822
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:13,950
you could do that I'm pretty sure you
 

823
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,190
you could do that I'm pretty sure you
can do that with the pen Book Pro that's

824
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,200
can do that with the pen Book Pro that's
 

825
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,240
can do that with the pen Book Pro that's
that would be amazing

826
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,250
that would be amazing
 

827
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,120
that would be amazing
yeah I've used similar technologies to

828
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,130
yeah I've used similar technologies to
 

829
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,740
yeah I've used similar technologies to
that and then stadia came out and it

830
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:21,750
that and then stadia came out and it
 

831
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,200
that and then stadia came out and it
really reminded me of that but I

832
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,210
really reminded me of that but I
 

833
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,419
really reminded me of that but I
couldn't remember the name of it because

834
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:26,429
couldn't remember the name of it because
 

835
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:28,580
couldn't remember the name of it because
the Google stadia is doing exactly that

836
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:28,590
the Google stadia is doing exactly that
 

837
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,620
the Google stadia is doing exactly that
with their supercomputers that basically

838
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:30,630
with their supercomputers that basically
 

839
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,570
with their supercomputers that basically
just got streaming computers that you're

840
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:32,580
just got streaming computers that you're
 

841
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,820
just got streaming computers that you're
connecting to I think that's that's the

842
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:34,830
connecting to I think that's that's the
 

843
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,490
connecting to I think that's that's the
next generation of gaming for sure the

844
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:37,500
next generation of gaming for sure the
 

845
