portion was a separate device on the you
 

255
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,050
portion was a separate device on the you
know that was installed on the circuit

at the when I looked at the

at the when I looked at the
 

261
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,140
at the when I looked at the
documentation for the CPU itself it

262
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,150
documentation for the CPU itself it
 

263
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,780
documentation for the CPU itself it
looks like it's built into the CPU and

looks like it's built into the CPU and

what you would normally talk on the
 

417
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,030
what you would normally talk on the
keyboard right so well I could as easily

keyboard right so well I could as easily
 

419
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,920
keyboard right so well I could as easily
type in each of those commands that are

420
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:18,930
type in each of those commands that are

manually if I felt like doing that and I
 

425
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,230
manually if I felt like doing that and I
you know would they would do exactly the

426
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
you know would they would do exactly the
 

427
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,340
you know would they would do exactly the
same yeah a question becomes whether I

428
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,350
same yeah a question becomes whether I
 

429
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,080
same yeah a question becomes whether I
have all the libraries on my machine

430
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,090
have all the libraries on my machine
 

431
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,140
have all the libraries on my machine
that you require that your program

432
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,150
that you require that your program
 

433
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,290
that you require that your program
requires that's relocated constraint

434
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,300
requires that's relocated constraint
 

435
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,090
requires that's relocated constraint
that's where I would be going for more

436
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,100
that's where I would be going for more
 

437
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,310
that's where I would be going for more
like a Deb pack which will include

like a Deb pack which will include
 

439
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,000
like a Deb pack which will include

dependencies so there's a track your Deb
 

441
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,670
dependencies so there's a track your Deb
pack is it's similar it's like a script

deep repositories under that directory

632
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,070
deep repositories under that directory
 

633
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,360
deep repositories under that directory
now I could easily using like a command

634
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,370
now I could easily using like a command
 

635
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,830
now I could easily using like a command
sure flowing out deep but on the layer

create your repo inside your normal

642
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,170
create your repo inside your normal
 

643
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,660
create your repo inside your normal
project directory just like you normally

644
00:17:59,660 --> 00:17:59,670
project directory just like you normally
 

645
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,790
project directory just like you normally
would right right I'm going to do that

646
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:01,800
would right right I'm going to do that
 

647
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,680
would right right I'm going to do that
you end up with a dot git directory

648
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:03,690
you end up with a dot git directory
 

649
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,080
you end up with a dot git directory
inside your project right how's your

650
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,090
inside your project right how's your
 

651
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,770
inside your project right how's your
question but that's what I'm getting to

652
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:09,780
question but that's what I'm getting to
 

653
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,450
question but that's what I'm getting to
right so then you can do from your

654
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:14,460
right so then you can do from your
 

655
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,040
right so then you can do from your
project directory once you've done some

656
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,050
project directory once you've done some
 

657
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,630
project directory once you've done some
check-in so you're not missing you're

658
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:17,640
check-in so you're not missing you're
 

659
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,960
check-in so you're not missing you're
not building an empty repo you can then

660
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:20,970
not building an empty repo you can then
 

661
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,610
not building an empty repo you can then

669
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,200
whatever the name of the project is yet
so what that will do is it will take

670
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,210
so what that will do is it will take
 

671
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,900
so what that will do is it will take
interest on the current repository that

672
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:44,910
interest on the current repository that
 

673
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,170
interest on the current repository that
that's in my local directory yeah and it

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,180
that's in my local directory yeah and it
 

675
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,190
that's in my local directory yeah and it
will create a bear repository in the /

676
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,200
will create a bear repository in the /
 

677
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,860
will create a bear repository in the /

that yeah so because I've got SS
 

693
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,770
that yeah so because I've got SS

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,839
like we did lab they let you create a

can run doxygen and I'll typically

752

can run doxygen and I'll typically
 

753
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,499
can run doxygen and I'll typically
generate that to my project folder slash

as you open that port boom you're
 

839
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,240
as you open that port boom you're
getting whacked away from every country

getting whacked away from every country
 

841
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:02,570
getting whacked away from every country
overseas and I found that when I moved

842
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:02,580
overseas and I found that when I moved
 

843
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,700
overseas and I found that when I moved
that port number you know way up in the

844
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:04,710
that port number you know way up in the
 

845
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,060
that port number you know way up in the
address right then it the hackers didn't

846
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,070
address right then it the hackers didn't
 

847
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,620
address right then it the hackers didn't
even know was there because they

848
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:09,630
even know was there because they
 

849
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,539
even know was there because they
typically only scan the first thousand

850

typically only scan the first thousand
 

851
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,090
typically only scan the first thousand
24 ports because they're the reserved

853
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,220
24 ports because they're the reserved
ports the well-known port yeah and then

854
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,230
ports the well-known port yeah and then
 

855
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,500
ports the well-known port yeah and then
some only scan for the air and the port

some only scan for the air and the port
 

857
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,810
some only scan for the air and the port
22 because they are looking for SSH

which you could put on this plane to
 

867
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,389
which you could put on this plane to
give you an input onto the box with an
