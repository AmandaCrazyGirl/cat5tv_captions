fifty bucks each I can get an HDMI
 

77
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,860
fifty bucks each I can get an HDMI
extender and that would allow me to run

78
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:39,870
extender and that would allow me to run

well what about trying something cheaper

just to see if it works and they got

86
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,260
just to see if it works and they got
 

87
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,110
just to see if it works and they got
these little five dollar couplers it's

88
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
these little five dollar couplers it's
 

89
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,870
these little five dollar couplers it's
like a 2-pack for 10 and it did not work

00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:56,880
like a 2-pack for 10 and it did not work

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:00,570
no you get what you pay for with your
 

93
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,470
no you get what you pay for with your
people but the idea was that it would

94
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,480
people but the idea was that it would
 

95
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,930
people but the idea was that it would
allow you to plug the camera into this

96
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:05,940
allow you to plug the camera into this
 

97
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,240
allow you to plug the camera into this
coupler and then that coupler into a 15

98
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,250

were not so on the screen it was just

106
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,400
were not so on the screen it was just
 

107
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,980
were not so on the screen it was just
all garbled and I just looked like a

108
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:24,990
all garbled and I just looked like a
 

109
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,090
all garbled and I just looked like a
mess so so that's not gonna work but the

110
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,100
mess so so that's not gonna work but the
 

111
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,210
mess so so that's not gonna work but the
good news is it gave me a new search

112
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
good news is it gave me a new search
 

113
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,450
good news is it gave me a new search
query because I was looking at HDMI

114
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,460
query because I was looking at HDMI
 

115
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,740
query because I was looking at HDMI
extenders right because that's the only

116
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:39,750
extenders right because that's the only
 

117
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,890
extenders right because that's the only
thing I'm familiar with which converts

118
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:42,900
thing I'm familiar with which converts
 

119
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,590
thing I'm familiar with which converts
it to a so you have a transmitter and a

120
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:45,600
it to a so you have a transmitter and a
 

121
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,540
it to a so you have a transmitter and a
receiver and then in between you have a

122
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:47,550
receiver and then in between you have a
 

123
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,020
receiver and then in between you have a
cat6 cable right so they're 150 bucks

124
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,030
cat6 cable right so they're 150 bucks
 

125
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,470
cat6 cable right so they're 150 bucks
each for the cheap ones and this is

126
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
each for the cheap ones and this is
 

127
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,690
each for the cheap ones and this is
because it's 4k not 1080p so you pay a

128
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:56,700
because it's 4k not 1080p so you pay a
 

129
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,130
because it's 4k not 1080p so you pay a
bit more the little couplers gave me a

130
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,140
bit more the little couplers gave me a
 

131
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,130
bit more the little couplers gave me a
new search query which was HDMI repeater

132
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:04,140
new search query which was HDMI repeater
 

133
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,550
new search query which was HDMI repeater
and so I did I used I used that as a

134
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:07,560
and so I did I used I used that as a
 

135
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,870
and so I did I used I used that as a
search query on B&H and for 30 bucks

136
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:11,880
search query on B&H and for 30 bucks
 

137
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,440
search query on B&H and for 30 bucks
they've got a powered repeater so it's

138
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,450
they've got a powered repeater so it's
 

139
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,750
they've got a powered repeater so it's
basically exactly like the coupler plug

140
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:17,760
basically exactly like the coupler plug
 

141
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,360
basically exactly like the coupler plug
one HDMI in here plug another HDMI here

142
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,370
one HDMI in here plug another HDMI here
 

143
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,670
one HDMI in here plug another HDMI here
and it acts as an as a repeater

144
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:22,680
and it acts as an as a repeater
 

145
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,700
and it acts as an as a repeater
but it's powered and watching between is

146
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:25,710
but it's powered and watching between is
 

147
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,570
but it's powered and watching between is
that is the

148
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,580
that is the
 

149
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,439
that is the
an Ethernet cable a cat5 no pointers it

150
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:30,449
an Ethernet cable a cat5 no pointers it
 

151
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,920
an Ethernet cable a cat5 no pointers it
just no Explo HDMI to HDMI but powered

152
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:33,930
just no Explo HDMI to HDMI but powered
 

153
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,830
just no Explo HDMI to HDMI but powered
ok so where where as the five dollar

154
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
ok so where where as the five dollar
 

155
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,790
ok so where where as the five dollar
ones were passive so so I'm hoping that

156
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
ones were passive so so I'm hoping that
 

157
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,869
ones were passive so so I'm hoping that
means it's going to give me the

158
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:41,879
means it's going to give me the
 

159
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,249
means it's going to give me the
bandwidth and the signal strength and

160
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:43,259
bandwidth and the signal strength and
 

161
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,700
bandwidth and the signal strength and
they are rated for 4k 60 you know so I

162
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,710
they are rated for 4k 60 you know so I
 

163
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,100
they are rated for 4k 60 you know so I
ordered four of them and we'll hope that

164
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,110
ordered four of them and we'll hope that
 

165
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,779
ordered four of them and we'll hope that
they get here fairly quickly because

166
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:50,789
they get here fairly quickly because
 

167
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,930
they get here fairly quickly because
last night was really tough did you open

last night was really tough did you open
 

169
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,909
last night was really tough did you open
up the passive ones to see what was

170
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
up the passive ones to see what was
 

171
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,969
up the passive ones to see what was
inside I'm bidding no I'm just while I

185
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,149
question is did you exceed the normal
length or an HDMI cable

186
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:19,159
length or an HDMI cable
 

187

oh so it sure worked no the coupler says
 

189
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,689
oh so it sure worked no the coupler says
that it will do up to 40 meters yeah not

190
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:26,699
that it will do up to 40 meters yeah not
 

191
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,480

only normal is that normal for HDMI
though if you did not have a couple of

194
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:31,169
though if you did not have a couple of
 

195
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,170
though if you did not have a couple of
what's the maximum length you could do I

196
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,180
what's the maximum length you could do I
 

197
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,740
what's the maximum length you could do I
think what I remember hearing years ago

198
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:36,750
think what I remember hearing years ago
 

199
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,050
think what I remember hearing years ago
when I started doing 4k was 50 feet is

200
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,060

201
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,670
when I started doing 4k was 50 feet is
kind of the end of the line before you

202
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,680
kind of the end of the line before you
 

203
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,709
kind of the end of the line before you
have to power something but I wasn't

204
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:42,719
have to power something but I wasn't
 

205

I did so that's why I was broadcasting

236
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:32,550
I did so that's why I was broadcasting
 

237
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,730
I did so that's why I was broadcasting
from my production studio last night

238
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:34,740
from my production studio last night
 

239
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,320
from my production studio last night
instead of the main studio I couldn't

240
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,330
instead of the main studio I couldn't
 

241
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,930
instead of the main studio I couldn't
run the cables into the main studio but

242
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:38,940
run the cables into the main studio but
 

243
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,399
run the cables into the main studio but
it was like a last-minute dad

244
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:40,409
it was like a last-minute dad
 

245
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,799
it was like a last-minute dad
because I was going to broadcast from

246
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:42,809
because I was going to broadcast from
 

247
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:46,639
because I was going to broadcast from
Studio E and then of course just before

248
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:46,649
Studio E and then of course just before
 

249
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,100
Studio E and then of course just before
the show is when I was testing

250
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,110
the show is when I was testing
 

251
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,629
the show is when I was testing
everything and it didn't work so I had

252
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
everything and it didn't work so I had
 

253
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,989
everything and it didn't work so I had
to come up with a solution which was to

254
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:53,999
to come up with a solution which was to
 

255
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,249
to come up with a solution which was to
put all the keys

256
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:55,259
put all the keys
 

257
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,859
put all the keys
put the camera and the the lighting in

258
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:57,869
put the camera and the the lighting in
 

259
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,559
put the camera and the the lighting in
my little office and broadcast from

260
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:00,569
my little office and broadcast from
 

261
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,149
my little office and broadcast from
there because the cable then could reach

262
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:02,159
there because the cable then could reach
 

263
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,729
there because the cable then could reach
the server directly without having to

264
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:04,739
the server directly without having to
 

265
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,159
the server directly without having to
extend it so that's what I did

266
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,169
extend it so that's what I did
 

267
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,309
extend it so that's what I did

in any other Roku you'll eat the only
 

469
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,190
in any other Roku you'll eat the only
thing with Roku and was studio D was the

470
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
thing with Roku and was studio D was the
 

471
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,950
thing with Roku and was studio D was the
lag time but I don't care about lag if I

472
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:18,960
lag time but I don't care about lag if I
 

473
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,130
lag time but I don't care about lag if I
get good smooth video but it wasn't

474
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:22,140
get good smooth video but it wasn't
 

475
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,660
get good smooth video but it wasn't
buffering or anything like that it was

476
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:23,670
buffering or anything like that it was
 

477
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,710
buffering or anything like that it was
it was it's literally just old frame

478
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:27,720
it was it's literally just old frame
 

479
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,170
it was it's literally just old frame
rate you would yeah very slow frame rate

480
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:30,180
rate you would yeah very slow frame rate
 

481
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,990
rate you would yeah very slow frame rate
it would it acted like a very low

482
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,000
it would it acted like a very low
 

483
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,740
it would it acted like a very low
resolution only every other frame was

484
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:36,750
resolution only every other frame was
 

485
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,570
resolution only every other frame was
coming through or something so it was

486
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:38,580
coming through or something so it was
 

487
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,340
coming through or something so it was
the original like I made the comedy yes

488
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,350
the original like I made the comedy yes
 

489
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:53,210
the original like I made the comedy yes
it was just like season one you were

490
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,220
it was just like season one you were
 

491
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,700
it was just like season one you were
dealing with yeah we'll have to do some

492
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:55,710
dealing with yeah we'll have to do some
 

493
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,320
dealing with yeah we'll have to do some
testing I know we did have we as in I

494
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,330
testing I know we did have we as in I
 

495
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,840
testing I know we did have we as in I
had wire cast locked up a few times and

496
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:02,850
had wire cast locked up a few times and
 

497
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,520
had wire cast locked up a few times and
I figured it out

498
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,530
I figured it out
 

499
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,280
I figured it out
during the first segment so before I had

500
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,290
during the first segment so before I had
 

501
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,770
during the first segment so before I had
before I restarted while your cast it

502
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:09,780
before I restarted while your cast it
 

503
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,330
before I restarted while your cast it
was actually because remember how at the

504
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,340
was actually because remember how at the
 

505
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,490
was actually because remember how at the
beginning if you were watching live I

506
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:13,500
beginning if you were watching live I
 

507
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,260
beginning if you were watching live I
shut off the servers and everything

508
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,270
shut off the servers and everything
 

509
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,360
shut off the servers and everything
because I didn't want to ambient noise

510
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,370
because I didn't want to ambient noise
 

511
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,240
because I didn't want to ambient noise
yes though Wirecast had a bunch of

512
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,250
yes though Wirecast had a bunch of
 

513
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,470
yes though Wirecast had a bunch of
assets the

514
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:21,480
assets the
 

515
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,720
assets the
loaded on the server so when I shut down

516
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:23,730
loaded on the server so when I shut down
 

517
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,210
loaded on the server so when I shut down
the server it actually lost access to

518
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,220
the server it actually lost access to
 

519
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,329
the server it actually lost access to
those files so so when it was like

520
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:29,339
those files so so when it was like
 

521
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,610
those files so so when it was like
stopping it was because it was having

522
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:31,620
stopping it was because it was having
 

523
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,509
stopping it was because it was having
trouble accessing network assets ok ok

524
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
trouble accessing network assets ok ok
 

525
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,000
trouble accessing network assets ok ok
so the second time when I reloaded it I

526
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,010
so the second time when I reloaded it I
 

527
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,829
so the second time when I reloaded it I
actually removed those assets before

528
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
actually removed those assets before
 

529
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,620
actually removed those assets before
going live if those fans are so loud in

530
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:42,630
going live if those fans are so loud in
 

531
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,560
going live if those fans are so loud in
the producers room now yeah

532
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:45,570
the producers room now yeah
 

533
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,509
the producers room now yeah
is it generating a bunch of heat as well

534
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
is it generating a bunch of heat as well
 

535
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,519
is it generating a bunch of heat as well
I mean the others fans running well

536
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:49,529
I mean the others fans running well
 

537
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,949
I mean the others fans running well
because they have to cool that much so

538
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:53,959
because they have to cool that much so
 

539
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,250
because they have to cool that much so
holding up ok well it's it's it's

540
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,260
holding up ok well it's it's it's
 

541
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,410
holding up ok well it's it's it's
notably warmer in the producers room

542
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:00,420
notably warmer in the producers room
 

543
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,400
notably warmer in the producers room
than in rubbished yeah but it's not

544
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,410
than in rubbished yeah but it's not
 

545
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,120
than in rubbished yeah but it's not
uncomfortable but but yes and no the the

546
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,130
uncomfortable but but yes and no the the
 

547
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,639
uncomfortable but but yes and no the the
fan on the backup drive is really loud

548
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:10,649
fan on the backup drive is really loud
 

549
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,879
fan on the backup drive is really loud
like it's yeah but it's only got two

550
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:13,889
like it's yeah but it's only got two
 

551
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,210
like it's yeah but it's only got two
hard drives in it and so it seems like

552
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,220
hard drives in it and so it seems like
 

553
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,400
hard drives in it and so it seems like
it could probably get away without a fan

554
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,410
it could probably get away without a fan
 

555
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,620
it could probably get away without a fan
but what I've done instead is back April

556
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:23,630
but what I've done instead is back April
 

557
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,269
but what I've done instead is back April
sixteenth I think it was well I ordered

558
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:26,279
sixteenth I think it was well I ordered
 

559
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,100
sixteenth I think it was well I ordered
off Amazon silent fan eighty millimeter

560
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,110
off Amazon silent fan eighty millimeter
 

561
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,290
off Amazon silent fan eighty millimeter
silent fan so I'm gonna replace that

562
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,300
silent fan so I'm gonna replace that
 

563
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,620
silent fan so I'm gonna replace that
it's just a standard PC okay and you

564
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,630
it's just a standard PC okay and you
 

565
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,350
it's just a standard PC okay and you
could treat him so yeah so I'll replace

566
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
could treat him so yeah so I'll replace
 

567
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,970
could treat him so yeah so I'll replace
that that's a quiet things down

568
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:42,980
that that's a quiet things down
 

569
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,280
that that's a quiet things down
could you do something like measure the

570
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,290
could you do something like measure the
 

571
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,930
could you do something like measure the
temperature in the bulb the main turn

572
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:47,940
temperature in the bulb the main turn
 

573
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:54,050
temperature in the bulb the main turn
the family will I don't know how a Dell

574
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,060
the family will I don't know how a Dell
 

575
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,180
the family will I don't know how a Dell
server handles that so the Dell server

576
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,190
server handles that so the Dell server
 

577
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,900
server handles that so the Dell server
it's like if the fans are automatically

578
00:14:59,900 --> 00:14:59,910
it's like if the fans are automatically
 

579
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,650
it's like if the fans are automatically
spun up as needed but but in the backup

580
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,660
spun up as needed but but in the backup
 

581
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,379
spun up as needed but but in the backup
I'll just replace the fan or I could

582
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:06,389
I'll just replace the fan or I could
 

583
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,300
I'll just replace the fan or I could
even put a I could put a resistor on the

584
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,310
even put a I could put a resistor on the
 

585
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,519
even put a I could put a resistor on the
fan and slow it down a little bit

586
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:10,529
fan and slow it down a little bit
 

587
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:12,379
fan and slow it down a little bit
yeah but then you'll then you'll slow

588
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:12,389
yeah but then you'll then you'll slow
 

589
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,990
yeah but then you'll then you'll slow
down that airflow as well so the fan

590
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,000
down that airflow as well so the fan
 

591
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,660
down that airflow as well so the fan
yeah but cooler I was a trooper

592
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:17,670
yeah but cooler I was a trooper
 

593
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,519
yeah but cooler I was a trooper
absolutely but as I was thinking it's

594
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:19,529
absolutely but as I was thinking it's
 

595
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,230
absolutely but as I was thinking it's
it's only got two drives in it and it's

596
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,240
it's only got two drives in it and it's
 

597
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,600
it's only got two drives in it and it's
just a backup drive so it only were it's

598
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:23,610
just a backup drive so it only were it's
 

599
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,180
just a backup drive so it only were it's
only really doing anything once a day

600
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,190
only really doing anything once a day
 

601
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,879
only really doing anything once a day
when the back takes place or when I when

602
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:28,889
when the back takes place or when I when
 

603
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,280
when the back takes place or when I when
I eject the drive and plug it back in

604
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,290
I eject the drive and plug it back in
 

605
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,960
I eject the drive and plug it back in
again it makes you wonder why it's

606
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:32,970
again it makes you wonder why it's
 

607
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,090
again it makes you wonder why it's
working so hard that it needs such

608
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,100
working so hard that it needs such
 

609
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,370
working so hard that it needs such
you know hard-working say um I don't

610
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:37,380
you know hard-working say um I don't
 

611
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,230
you know hard-working say um I don't
think it is I think it's it's just not

612
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,240
think it is I think it's it's just not
 

613
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,010
think it is I think it's it's just not
PWM it's just it's just a it's spinning

614
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,020
PWM it's just it's just a it's spinning
 

615
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,100
PWM it's just it's just a it's spinning
at maximum velocity and it's probably

616
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,110
at maximum velocity and it's probably
 

617
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,730
at maximum velocity and it's probably
just a cheap fans Delson noisy the Dells

618
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,740
just a cheap fans Delson noisy the Dells
 

619
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:58,360
just a cheap fans Delson noisy the Dells
are - yeah I remember Eric in their 2016

620
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,370

 

621
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,800

replacing our to use over here and we

622
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:03,810

make the the SSDs won't only be quieter
but also a lot cooler I would expect so

780
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:01,560
but also a lot cooler I would expect so
 

781
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,650
but also a lot cooler I would expect so
now definitely quicker for my server

782
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:04,660
now definitely quicker for my server
 

783
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,020
now definitely quicker for my server
though it's pretty much only file

784
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,030
though it's pretty much only file
 

785
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,180
though it's pretty much only file
storage at other than I do have some

786
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,190
storage at other than I do have some
 

787
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,070
storage at other than I do have some
virtual machines running on it I've got

788
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,080
virtual machines running on it I've got
 

789
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,640
virtual machines running on it I've got
VirtualBox on it but it doesn't really

790
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:14,650
VirtualBox on it but it doesn't really
 

791
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,100
VirtualBox on it but it doesn't really
need a lot of juice though if I had a

792
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,110
need a lot of juice though if I had a
 

793
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,780
need a lot of juice though if I had a
more powerful server I think I'd

794
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:18,790
more powerful server I think I'd
 

795
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,090
more powerful server I think I'd
probably like install my website and

796
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:21,100
probably like install my website and
 

797
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,880
probably like install my website and
back-end architecture on a virtual

798
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:23,890
back-end architecture on a virtual
 

799
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,980
back-end architecture on a virtual
machine I think that's one really nice

800
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:25,990
machine I think that's one really nice
 

801
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,590
machine I think that's one really nice
so in this thing you wouldn't use an ish

802
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:28,600
so in this thing you wouldn't use an ish
 

803
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,940
so in this thing you wouldn't use an ish
ish day for a hug drugs intensive time

804
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:32,950
ish day for a hug drugs intensive time
 

805
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,850
ish day for a hug drugs intensive time
yeah lots of region I would but I would

806
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:35,860
yeah lots of region I would but I would
 

807
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:47,180
yeah lots of region I would but I would
use a Enterprise SSD hmm for that price

808
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,190

 

809
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,360

oh the big the biggest difference with

810
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,370
oh the big the biggest difference with
 

811
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,190
oh the big the biggest difference with
the the enterprise versus the consumer

812
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
the the enterprise versus the consumer
 

813
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,720
the the enterprise versus the consumer
drives I would say is the how much data

814
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:57,730
drives I would say is the how much data
 

815
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,760
drives I would say is the how much data
can be written and read from it

816
00:21:59,760 --> 00:21:59,770
can be written and read from it
 

817
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,800
can be written and read from it
before the drive is subject to failure

818
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:03,810
before the drive is subject to failure
 

819
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,030
before the drive is subject to failure
Enterprise drives also are meant to be

820
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,040
Enterprise drives also are meant to be
 

821
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,210
Enterprise drives also are meant to be
run 24/7 with heavy workload yeah where

822
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:09,220
run 24/7 with heavy workload yeah where
 

823
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,340
run 24/7 with heavy workload yeah where
as a consumer drive a consumer drive is

824
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,350
as a consumer drive a consumer drive is
 

825
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,480
as a consumer drive a consumer drive is
meant to be like

826
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,490
meant to be like

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,220
meant to be like
powered on and powered off when you're

828
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,230
powered on and powered off when you're
 

829

five dot TV do a search for Kingston and
 

851
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:56,100
five dot TV do a search for Kingston and
I would say what what would be a good

852
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,110
I would say what what would be a good
 

853
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,529
I would say what what would be a good
search query just do a search for

854
00:22:58,529 --> 00:22:58,539
search query just do a search for
 

855
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:02,700
search query just do a search for
Kingston enterprise and you'll see we

856
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:02,710
Kingston enterprise and you'll see we
 

857
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,619
Kingston enterprise and you'll see we
talk well we've talked about both but

858
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:04,629
talk well we've talked about both but
 

859
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:09,379
talk well we've talked about both but
I've I've had an interview about the

I've I've had an interview about the
 

861
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,899
I've I've had an interview about the
data center the DC for hundreds I

862
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:12,909
data center the DC for hundreds I
 

863
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:16,019
data center the DC for hundreds I
believe so those would be the ones I'd

864
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:16,029
believe so those would be the ones I'd
 

865
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:28,499
believe so those would be the ones I'd
be put in oh yeah yeah it depends on

more of like soul boo just mentioned if
I screwed up my config I can easily

960
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:25,629
I screwed up my config I can easily
 

961
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,080

I can easily revert a change because if
 

967
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,739
I can easily revert a change because if
I'm working on a server I'm probably

I'm working on a server I'm probably
 

969
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:37,739
I'm working on a server I'm probably
using nano or VI where I don't always

970
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:37,749
using nano or VI where I don't always
 

971
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:40,560
using nano or VI where I don't always
have the capability of undoing what I

972
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:40,570
have the capability of undoing what I
 

973
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,450

just screwed up so

974
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:42,460
just screwed up so
 

975
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,580
just screwed up so
I just want to make that point you don't

976
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:44,590
I just want to make that point you don't
 

977
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,619
I just want to make that point you don't
treat this like a backup solution

978
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:46,629
treat this like a backup solution
 

979
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:49,350
treat this like a backup solution
because it's not it is not a backup got

980
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
because it's not it is not a backup got
 

981
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,230
because it's not it is not a backup got
it it is a version control use our diff

982
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
it it is a version control use our diff
 

983
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,389
it it is a version control use our diff
- backup that's the one I love

984
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:54,399
- backup that's the one I love
 

985
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,100
- backup that's the one I love
check that out if you haven't already

986
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,110
check that out if you haven't already
 

987
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,909
check that out if you haven't already
our diff is a tool that is able to check

988
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
our diff is a tool that is able to check
 

989
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,039
our diff is a tool that is able to check
the difference between files at a bit by

990
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:02,049
the difference between files at a bit by
 

991
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,100
the difference between files at a bit by
bit level okay our different backup uses

992
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,110
bit level okay our different backup uses
 

993
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,369
bit level okay our different backup uses
our sink in addition to that so you're

994
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:08,379
our sink in addition to that so you're
 

995
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:10,919
our sink in addition to that so you're
able to run a backup at the bit level so

996
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:10,929
able to run a backup at the bit level so
 

997
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,389
able to run a backup at the bit level so
if you modify a file the backups usage

998
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:15,399
if you modify a file the backups usage
 

999
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,190
if you modify a file the backups usage
on the disk is only the size of the

1000
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
on the disk is only the size of the
 

1001
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,129
on the disk is only the size of the
change not the actual file so what do

1002
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:20,139
change not the actual file so what do
 

1003
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,600
change not the actual file so what do
you what do you end up getting on where

1004
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:24,610
you what do you end up getting on where
 

1005
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,820
you what do you end up getting on where
your backup destination is what do you

1006
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:26,830
your backup destination is what do you
 

1007
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,970
your backup destination is what do you
get you get a full working copy of the

1008
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:29,980
get you get a full working copy of the
 

1009
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,710
get you get a full working copy of the
backup that you can access the files

1010
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:31,720
backup that you can access the files
 

1011
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,539
backup that you can access the files
however within that you use our diff

1012
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:36,549
however within that you use our diff
 

1013
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:39,450
however within that you use our diff
backup is the tool but how do I get the

1014
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:39,460
backup is the tool but how do I get the
 

1015
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,649
backup is the tool but how do I get the
files back

1016
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:40,659
files back
 

1017
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,570
files back
well there you could just copy and paste

1018
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:42,580
well there you could just copy and paste
 

1019
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,159
well there you could just copy and paste
them if you wanted to however using

them if you wanted to however using
 

1021
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,859
them if you wanted to however using
artifact up with the restore options you

1022
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:46,869
artifact up with the restore options you
 

1023
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:49,080
artifact up with the restore options you
can go back in time to any previous date

1024
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,090
can go back in time to any previous date
 

1025
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,359
can go back in time to any previous date
okay so you can actually go back to a

1026
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:51,369
okay so you can actually go back to a
 

1027
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,210
okay so you can actually go back to a
week ago or a month ago whatever so the

week ago or a month ago whatever so the
 

1029
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,070
week ago or a month ago whatever so the
tool is fantastic it's like time machine

1030
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
tool is fantastic it's like time machine
 

1031
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,450
tool is fantastic it's like time machine
for Linux terminal and the job I had

1032
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:00,460
for Linux terminal and the job I had
 

1033
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:07,799
for Linux terminal and the job I had
before I had the computer setup to copy

1034
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:07,809
before I had the computer setup to copy
 

1035
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:14,639
before I had the computer setup to copy
