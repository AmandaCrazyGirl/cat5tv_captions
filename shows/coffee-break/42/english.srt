00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,260
proper case yeah it's possible
probably well but and it's got fully to

158
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,270
probably well but and it's got fully to
 

159
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,900
probably well but and it's got fully to
fully HDMI connector not those micros

160
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:26,910
fully HDMI connector not those micros
 

161
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,770
fully HDMI connector not those micros
that the four has they run right yeah

162
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:30,780
that the four has they run right yeah
 

163
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,280
that the four has they run right yeah
yeah hey Ron no these are FM processes

164
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,290
yeah hey Ron no these are FM processes
 

165
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,550
yeah hey Ron no these are FM processes
right these are not Intel processor

166
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,560
right these are not Intel processor
 

167
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,810
right these are not Intel processor
these are am logics and logic so there

168
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:41,820
these are am logics and logic so there
 

169
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,390
these are am logics and logic so there
are different you said there are

170
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
are different you said there are
 

171
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,310
are different you said there are
different instruction set to Intel for

172
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
different instruction set to Intel for
 

173
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,940
different instruction set to Intel for
instance right yeah yeah so any Linux

174
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:49,950
instance right yeah yeah so any Linux
 

175
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,770
instance right yeah yeah so any Linux
packages that I would water install

176
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:51,780
packages that I would water install
 

177
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,960
packages that I would water install
would have to would have to have been

178
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:53,970
would have to would have to have been
 

179
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,510
would have to would have to have been
compiled for that instruction set her

180
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,520
compiled for that instruction set her
 

181
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,400
compiled for that instruction set her
arm based they have to be arm base yeah

182
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,410
arm based they have to be arm base yeah
 

183
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,040
arm based they have to be arm base yeah
garlic okay okay

184
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,050
garlic okay okay
 

185
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,400
garlic okay okay
which is you know that good rhyming I

186
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,410
which is you know that good rhyming I
 

187
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,409
which is you know that good rhyming I
was just gonna say like that was when

188
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:06,419
was just gonna say like that was when
 

189
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,330
was just gonna say like that was when
the Raspberry Pi first came out there

190
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,340
the Raspberry Pi first came out there
 

191
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,719
the Raspberry Pi first came out there
weren't a lot of arm users out there so

192
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:10,729
weren't a lot of arm users out there so
 

193
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,810
weren't a lot of arm users out there so
but now it's like pretty much any modern

194
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:14,820
but now it's like pretty much any modern
 

195
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,130
but now it's like pretty much any modern
project is available on the ARM

196
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,140
project is available on the ARM
 

197
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,409
project is available on the ARM
architecture so I haven't really

198
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:18,419
architecture so I haven't really
 

199
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,440
architecture so I haven't really
encountered any trouble that way in the

200
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,450
encountered any trouble that way in the
 

201
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,690
encountered any trouble that way in the
past maybe a year or two you know which

202
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:23,700
past maybe a year or two you know which
 

203
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,260
past maybe a year or two you know which
one isn't this quarter are you kidding I

204
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,270
one isn't this quarter are you kidding I
 

205
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,420
one isn't this quarter are you kidding I
guess I mean there's the there's the

206
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,430
guess I mean there's the there's the
 

207
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,969
guess I mean there's the there's the
obvious ones like VirtualBox and you

208
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:34,979
obvious ones like VirtualBox and you
 

209
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,219
obvious ones like VirtualBox and you
know stuff like that but that's because

210
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:37,229
know stuff like that but that's because
 

211
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,640
know stuff like that but that's because
it's x86 emulation right

212
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:40,650
it's x86 emulation right
 

213
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,290
it's x86 emulation right
you know discord though you got to do it

214
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,300
you know discord though you got to do it
 

215
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,060
you know discord though you got to do it
in the browser if you want to put it on

216
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,070
in the browser if you want to put it on
 

217
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,659
in the browser if you want to put it on
this on and on thing a good thing at

218
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:47,669
this on and on thing a good thing at
 

219
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,120
this on and on thing a good thing at
this I like the idea having emmc

220
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,130
this I like the idea having emmc
 

221
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,260

you know yeah and it's funny because I

222
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,270
you know yeah and it's funny because I
 

223
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,140
you know yeah and it's funny because I
went to the the download site to get the

224
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,150
went to the the download site to get the
 

225
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,370
went to the the download site to get the
Ubuntu 2004 droid none of the links work

226
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:03,380
Ubuntu 2004 droid none of the links work
 

227

stable yeah somebody said that it's

230
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:09,600
stable yeah somebody said that it's
 

231
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,330
stable yeah somebody said that it's
brand new it's never gonna be stable

232
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,340
brand new it's never gonna be stable
 

233
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,240
brand new it's never gonna be stable
right out the gate I I don't have

234
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,250
right out the gate I I don't have
 

235
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,740
right out the gate I I don't have
problems with it

236
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:15,750
problems with it
 

237
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,320
problems with it
the thing is is I did order to emmc

238
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,330
the thing is is I did order to emmc
 

239
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,900
the thing is is I did order to emmc
cards and they came preloaded with the

240
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:20,910
cards and they came preloaded with the
 

241
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,090
cards and they came preloaded with the
2004 on it oh no okay what's the latest

242
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,100
2004 on it oh no okay what's the latest
 

243
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,050
2004 on it oh no okay what's the latest
stable version hey you know for I get

244
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,060
stable version hey you know for I get
 

245
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,650
stable version hey you know for I get
you know for for LTS yeah okay that's

246
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:33,660
you know for for LTS yeah okay that's
 

247
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,570
you know for for LTS yeah okay that's
probably when I would go with then I

248
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:35,580
probably when I would go with then I
 

249
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:54,650
probably when I would go with then I
think I've got 1604 installed after top

250
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:54,660
think I've got 1604 installed after top
 

251
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,790
think I've got 1604 installed after top
of my head I don't remember

252
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:55,800
of my head I don't remember
 

253
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,860
of my head I don't remember
I think it's 1604 is what I've got

254
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:57,870
I think it's 1604 is what I've got
 

255
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,890
I think it's 1604 is what I've got
currently installed but now the you

256
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:00,900
currently installed but now the you
 

257
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,550
currently installed but now the you
every LTS version comes out every what

258
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
every LTS version comes out every what
 

259
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,790
every LTS version comes out every what
four years doesn't to you it's to you

260
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:07,800
four years doesn't to you it's to you
 

261
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,000
four years doesn't to you it's to you
yeah okay so 2004 is gonna be the next

262
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,010
yeah okay so 2004 is gonna be the next
 

263
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,750
yeah okay so 2004 is gonna be the next
LTS version it is the next LTS so it's

264
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:14,760
LTS version it is the next LTS so it's
 

265
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,980
LTS version it is the next LTS so it's
only a matter of a little bit of time 16

266
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:17,990
only a matter of a little bit of time 16
 

267
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:24,110
only a matter of a little bit of time 16
okay yeah yeah I too AM keen on that

268
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,120
okay yeah yeah I too AM keen on that
 

269
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,870
okay yeah yeah I too AM keen on that
emmc as opposed to SD cuz that's the

270
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:26,880
emmc as opposed to SD cuz that's the
 

271
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,370
emmc as opposed to SD cuz that's the
biggest downfall I think of the

272
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:28,380
biggest downfall I think of the
 

273
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,409
biggest downfall I think of the
Raspberry Pi if you can call it downfall

274
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:30,419
Raspberry Pi if you can call it downfall
 

275
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,140
Raspberry Pi if you can call it downfall
not really but we talked about that I

276
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,150
not really but we talked about that I
 

277
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,550
not really but we talked about that I
should yeah yeah mmm-hmm no no

278
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
should yeah yeah mmm-hmm no no
 

279
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,380
should yeah yeah mmm-hmm no no
absolutely it's kind of redundant to say

280
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,390
absolutely it's kind of redundant to say
 

281
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,320
absolutely it's kind of redundant to say
it but yeah the c4 is like a Raspberry

282
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,330
it but yeah the c4 is like a Raspberry
 

283
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:49,390
it but yeah the c4 is like a Raspberry
Pi for in so many ways but at emmc yeah

284
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,400

 

285
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,819

the other devices like the pine book and

286
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:52,829
the other devices like the pine book and
 

287
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:53,950
the other devices like the pine book and
prank or pro

288
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:53,960
prank or pro
 

289
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,010
prank or pro
eventually the point I'm all do am MC is

290
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,020
eventually the point I'm all do am MC is
 

291
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,730
eventually the point I'm all do am MC is
alright

292
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:57,740
alright
 

293
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,400
alright
mmm-hmm true yeah okay I really don't do

294
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,410
mmm-hmm true yeah okay I really don't do
 

295
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,920
mmm-hmm true yeah okay I really don't do
that I meant to pine phone I'm sorry

296
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:05,930
that I meant to pine phone I'm sorry
 

297
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,820
that I meant to pine phone I'm sorry
yeah yeah I've got to get into this emmc

298
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:09,830
yeah yeah I've got to get into this emmc
 

299
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,680
yeah yeah I've got to get into this emmc
stuff so I think I might have to just

300
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:11,690
stuff so I think I might have to just
 

301
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,090
stuff so I think I might have to just
get me and our droid oh yeah yeah my

302
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,100
get me and our droid oh yeah yeah my
 

303
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,040
get me and our droid oh yeah yeah my
favorite board is for the longest time

304
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,050
favorite board is for the longest time
 

305
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,620
favorite board is for the longest time
has been the xe4 I think just as an

306
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:20,630
has been the xe4 I think just as an
 

307
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,260
has been the xe4 I think just as an
all-round like use this for everything

308
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,270
all-round like use this for everything
 

309
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,480
all-round like use this for everything
that you normally would use a little

310
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,490

good
 

315
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,030
good

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,270
almost every way is on just the hair
 

327
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,710
almost every way is on just the hair
below the xu4 okay so xe4 is still on

328
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:47,720
below the xu4 okay so xe4 is still on
 

329
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:59,260

top of that just barely Riley but it

330
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,270
top of that just barely Riley but it
 

331
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,000
top of that just barely Riley but it
still holds its own as being a really

good little Debian server

334
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
good little Debian server
 

335
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,460
good little Debian server
okay the xu4 has been out for years yeah

336
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,470
okay the xu4 has been out for years yeah
 

337
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,210
okay the xu4 has been out for years yeah
it feels like two years anyways so so it

338
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:10,220
it feels like two years anyways so so it
 

339
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,640
it feels like two years anyways so so it
sounds like mush man you've already

340
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:12,650
sounds like mush man you've already
 

341
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,910
sounds like mush man you've already
showed us your room your farm of this

342
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:18,920
showed us your room your farm of this
 

343
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,510
showed us your room your farm of this
pcs they just keep it going they do so I

344
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:22,520
pcs they just keep it going they do so I
 

345
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,360
pcs they just keep it going they do so I
guess you just keep adding in us PC when

346
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,370
guess you just keep adding in us PC when
 

347
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,310
guess you just keep adding in us PC when
you've got something new to deploy right

348
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,320
you've got something new to deploy right
 

349
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,760
you've got something new to deploy right
so I don't tell them I am when they

350
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:30,770
so I don't tell them I am when they
 

351
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,790
so I don't tell them I am when they
become out okay

352
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:33,800
become out okay
 

353
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,449
become out okay
yes you saw all those in use those are

354
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:37,459
yes you saw all those in use those are
 

355
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,660
yes you saw all those in use those are
all names okay I have a bunch that are

356
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:40,670
all names okay I have a bunch that are
 

357
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,579
all names okay I have a bunch that are
still in those those plastic drawers

358
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:42,589
still in those those plastic drawers
 

359
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,470
still in those those plastic drawers
they're just sitting there

360
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
they're just sitting there
 

361
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,140
they're just sitting there
and I guess the point is that you only

362
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,150
and I guess the point is that you only
 

363
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,720
and I guess the point is that you only
run names on that on those particular

364
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:49,730
run names on that on those particular
 

365
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,750
run names on that on those particular
devices right I tested karate okay okay

366
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:54,760
devices right I tested karate okay okay
 

367
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,639

he mentioned that the c2 was going

374
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:08,700
he mentioned that the c2 was going
 

375
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,870
he mentioned that the c2 was going
bye-bye and then it's like oh man I got

376
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:11,880
bye-bye and then it's like oh man I got
 

377
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,050
bye-bye and then it's like oh man I got
that means I have to get a c4

378
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:14,060
that means I have to get a c4
 

379
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,370
that means I have to get a c4
immediately because I'm gonna have to

380
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:16,380
immediately because I'm gonna have to
 

381
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,990
immediately because I'm gonna have to
port names to it I'm gonna have to

382
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
port names to it I'm gonna have to
 

383
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,390
port names to it I'm gonna have to
replace the c2 you run them 24/7 yeah

384
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,400
replace the c2 you run them 24/7 yeah
 

385
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,800
replace the c2 you run them 24/7 yeah
yeah they're that mine around all the

386
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:24,810
yeah they're that mine around all the
 

387
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,260

time my lion exam where is my piehole

388
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,270
time my lion exam where is my piehole
 

389
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,040

like a like Star Trek yes you run them

390
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,050
like a like Star Trek yes you run them
 

391
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:47,180
like a like Star Trek yes you run them
all off at UPS absolutely absolutely we

392
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,190
all off at UPS absolutely absolutely we
 

393
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,030
all off at UPS absolutely absolutely we
lost power last week and we were really

394
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,040
lost power last week and we were really
 

395
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,850
lost power last week and we were really
discussing it funny we did seems every

396
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:52,860
discussing it funny we did seems every
 

397
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,260
discussing it funny we did seems every
time we discuss something like that

398
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,270
time we discuss something like that
 

399
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,080
time we discuss something like that
something happens so we lost the are and

400
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,090
something happens so we lost the are and
 

401
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,710
something happens so we lost the are and
I believe the the UPS said I still had

402
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
I believe the the UPS said I still had
 

403
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,320
I believe the the UPS said I still had
well over 200 minutes of power for all

404
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,330
well over 200 minutes of power for all
 

405
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,260
well over 200 minutes of power for all
those SBC's running out of my UPS

406
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,270
those SBC's running out of my UPS
 

407
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,120
those SBC's running out of my UPS
batteries or anywhere near that good I

408
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,130
batteries or anywhere near that good I
 

409
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,040
batteries or anywhere near that good I
wouldn't get even with just an icepick

410
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,050
wouldn't get even with just an icepick
 

411
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,900
wouldn't get even with just an icepick
so you don't get anywhere near that kind

412
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:11,910
so you don't get anywhere near that kind
 

413
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,560
so you don't get anywhere near that kind
of injury I barely know mine - barely

414
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,570
of injury I barely know mine - barely
 

415
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,290
of injury I barely know mine - barely
know they don't draw a lot of power so

416
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:20,300
know they don't draw a lot of power so
 

417
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,450
know they don't draw a lot of power so
I'm eager to see how this one you unit

418
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:23,460
I'm eager to see how this one you unit
 

419
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm eager to see how this one you unit
comes together I did order the parts for

420
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:25,890
comes together I did order the parts for
 

421
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,670
comes together I did order the parts for
that - for the power units so hopefully

422
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:28,680
that - for the power units so hopefully
 

423
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,830
that - for the power units so hopefully
hopefully that'll all come together but

424
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:30,840
hopefully that'll all come together but
 

425
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,310
hopefully that'll all come together but
finding out that I well figuring that I

426
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
finding out that I well figuring that I
 

427
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,580
finding out that I well figuring that I
gotta go only with five volt boards and

428
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,590
gotta go only with five volt boards and
 

429
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,890
gotta go only with five volt boards and
I noticed bill that the c4 allows

430
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:39,900
I noticed bill that the c4 allows
 

431
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,400
I noticed bill that the c4 allows
anywhere from 5.5 to 14 volts so that is

432
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,410
anywhere from 5.5 to 14 volts so that is
 

433
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:56,000
anywhere from 5.5 to 14 volts so that is
your board my friend yeah so but it's

434
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,010
your board my friend yeah so but it's
 

435
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,800
your board my friend yeah so but it's
it's not gonna go into the one you cuz

436
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:57,810
it's not gonna go into the one you cuz
 

437
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,800
it's not gonna go into the one you cuz
it takes I'm gonna use a 12 volt 2 amp

438
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:00,810
it takes I'm gonna use a 12 volt 2 amp
 

439
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,400
it takes I'm gonna use a 12 volt 2 amp
for that once okay well we'll see how

440
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,410
for that once okay well we'll see how
 

441
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,160
for that once okay well we'll see how
this chassis you know how I can fill it

442
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,170
this chassis you know how I can fill it

we go put a big ol sign on it 12 volts

456
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:23,810
we go put a big ol sign on it 12 volts
 

457
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,530
we go put a big ol sign on it 12 volts
on one 5 volts on the other and make

458
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:26,540
on one 5 volts on the other and make
 

459
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:33,430
on one 5 volts on the other and make
sure they don't cross yes that's that's

460
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
sure they don't cross yes that's that's
 

461
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,660
sure they don't cross yes that's that's
not a bad idea

yeah ii have a second one year yeah I

464
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,020
yeah ii have a second one year yeah I
 

465
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,190
yeah ii have a second one year yeah I
say do it man come on let's go you know

466
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,200
say do it man come on let's go you know
 

467
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,470
say do it man come on let's go you know
what's interesting about it so you think

468
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
what's interesting about it so you think
 

469
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
what's interesting about it so you think
about well don't cross the the power

470
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,330
about well don't cross the the power
 

471
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,000
about well don't cross the the power
well I'm I'm bringing the power in from

472
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,010
well I'm I'm bringing the power in from
 

473
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,970
well I'm I'm bringing the power in from
a 19 volt power adapter and then I'm

474
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:51,980
a 19 volt power adapter and then I'm
 

475
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,120
a 19 volt power adapter and then I'm
stepping it down to 5 volts or at all

476
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,130
stepping it down to 5 volts or at all
 

477
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,519
stepping it down to 5 volts or at all
along dip it down to 5 volts just as

478
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:57,529
along dip it down to 5 volts just as
 

479
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,070
along dip it down to 5 volts just as
easily well that's the thing so even if

480
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,080
easily well that's the thing so even if
 

481
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,810
easily well that's the thing so even if
even if you accidentally swapped the

482
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:01,820
even if you accidentally swapped the
 

483
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,310
even if you accidentally swapped the
cable the step-down is still gonna take

484
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:03,320
cable the step-down is still gonna take
 

485
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,070
cable the step-down is still gonna take
it down to 12 volts well as long as or 5

486
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,080
it down to 12 volts well as long as or 5
 

487
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,370
it down to 12 volts well as long as or 5
dollars 10 volt input yeah yeah well

488
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:09,380
dollars 10 volt input yeah yeah well
 

489
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,440
dollars 10 volt input yeah yeah well
that's it I'm rien ding all the cables

490
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,450
that's it I'm rien ding all the cables
 

491
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,040
that's it I'm rien ding all the cables
so yeah so it's gonna be just a power

492
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,050
so yeah so it's gonna be just a power
 

493
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,260
so yeah so it's gonna be just a power
jack on the back of the server barrel

494
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,270
jack on the back of the server barrel
 

495
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,300
jack on the back of the server barrel
connector that I can plug into and then

496
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,310
connector that I can plug into and then
 

497
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,579
connector that I can plug into and then
I'll just tie the the cable onto the

498
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:21,589
I'll just tie the the cable onto the
 

499
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,460
I'll just tie the the cable onto the
chassis or something with a tie wrap

500
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,470
chassis or something with a tie wrap
 

501
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,940
chassis or something with a tie wrap
good idea 2 2 1 2 1 1 unit it's too bad

502
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:30,950
good idea 2 2 1 2 1 1 unit it's too bad
 

503
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,040
good idea 2 2 1 2 1 1 unit it's too bad
it like the one that I bought it was on

504
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,050
it like the one that I bought it was on
 

505
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,780
it like the one that I bought it was on
special for 30 bucks and of course at

506
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:37,790
special for 30 bucks and of course at
 

507
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,870
special for 30 bucks and of course at
that yeah at that price though they sold

508
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
that yeah at that price though they sold
 

509
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,350
that yeah at that price though they sold
out so I don't think I'll now now that

510
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
out so I don't think I'll now now that
 

511
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,860
out so I don't think I'll now now that
you mention it I feel terrible yeah

512
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:52,870

 

513
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,000

should have bought three just to have a

514
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,010
should have bought three just to have a
 

515
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:01,269
should have bought three just to have a
backup one you know what if I had a

516
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
backup one you know what if I had a
 

517
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,350
backup one you know what if I had a
third one I put a cluster board fine 64

518
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
third one I put a cluster board fine 64
 

519
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,390
third one I put a cluster board fine 64
cluster board in that one that's semanas

520
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:10,400
cluster board in that one that's semanas
 

521
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,579
cluster board in that one that's semanas
Liddy right there Lamia Rix Rex bye

522
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:12,589
Liddy right there Lamia Rix Rex bye
 

523
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,090
Liddy right there Lamia Rix Rex bye
Steve thank you I do yeah and it's a

524
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,100
Steve thank you I do yeah and it's a
 

525
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,760
Steve thank you I do yeah and it's a
double-sided rack so whole break the

526
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:18,770
double-sided rack so whole break the
 

527
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,829
double-sided rack so whole break the
height of it and times it by two on the

528
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
height of it and times it by two on the
 

529
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,769
height of it and times it by two on the
one I would've done it though that if

530
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:26,779
one I would've done it though that if
 

531
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,930
one I would've done it though that if
you good blood flow volcania but they

532
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:28,940
you good blood flow volcania but they
 

533
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,000
you good blood flow volcania but they
just quit the bad guy

534
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,010
just quit the bad guy
 

535
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,700
just quit the bad guy
I feel yeah well with the step down

536
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:36,710
I feel yeah well with the step down
 

537
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,110
I feel yeah well with the step down
though it'll take it to whatever voltage

538
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,120
though it'll take it to whatever voltage
 

539
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,760
though it'll take it to whatever voltage
I've set it at no matter what I plug

540
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,770
I've set it at no matter what I plug
 

541
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,630
I've set it at no matter what I plug
into it

542
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:40,640
into it
 

543
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,340
into it
you got me gap would we do that could

544
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,350
you got me gap would we do that could
 

545
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,170
you got me gap would we do that could
you could really be a funny movie blog

546
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,180
you could really be a funny movie blog
 

547
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,350
you could really be a funny movie blog
the long run in and bang you got nothing

548
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:50,360
the long run in and bang you got nothing
 

549
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,010
the long run in and bang you got nothing
yeah Peter you can plug your 19 volts

550
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,020
yeah Peter you can plug your 19 volts
 

551
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,570
yeah Peter you can plug your 19 volts
into any one of us exactly I'm

552
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:55,580
into any one of us exactly I'm
 

553
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,050
into any one of us exactly I'm
converters and it'll work

554
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,060
converters and it'll work
 

555
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,150
converters and it'll work
and Peter suggests that plugging in the

556
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,160
and Peter suggests that plugging in the
 

557
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,710
and Peter suggests that plugging in the
wrong voltage could damage your

558
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
wrong voltage could damage your
 

559
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:13,900
wrong voltage could damage your
equipment Marsh man any comments that's

560
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:13,910
equipment Marsh man any comments that's
 

561
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,100
equipment Marsh man any comments that's
one of the neat things about a step-down

562
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,110
one of the neat things about a step-down
 

563
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,440
one of the neat things about a step-down
though is that you can set it to 5 volts

564
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,450
though is that you can set it to 5 volts
 

565
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,390
though is that you can set it to 5 volts
or 5.2 volts or whatever you want and no

566
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:19,400
or 5.2 volts or whatever you want and no
 

567
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,420
or 5.2 volts or whatever you want and no
matter what your input is so if it's I

568
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,430
matter what your input is so if it's I
 

569
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,190
matter what your input is so if it's I
can plug 15 volts into that I could plug

570
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,200
can plug 15 volts into that I could plug
 

571
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,070
can plug 15 volts into that I could plug
12 volts or 19 and it's still gonna step

572
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,080
12 volts or 19 and it's still gonna step
 

573
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:39,360
12 volts or 19 and it's still gonna step
it down to 5 what do you think yeah

574
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,370
it down to 5 what do you think yeah
 

575
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,280
it down to 5 what do you think yeah
mm-hmm with the step-down it's going to

576
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,290
mm-hmm with the step-down it's going to
 

577
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,960
mm-hmm with the step-down it's going to
just give you a different amperage but

578
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:43,970
just give you a different amperage but
 

579
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,050
just give you a different amperage but
the voltage will still be stable so I'll

580
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,060
the voltage will still be stable so I'll
 

581
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,120
the voltage will still be stable so I'll
get 5 point 2 volts with more amps if I

582
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,130
get 5 point 2 volts with more amps if I
 

583
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,430
get 5 point 2 volts with more amps if I
plug in a more powerful power supply so

584
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
plug in a more powerful power supply so
 

585
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,480
plug in a more powerful power supply so
I like that idea

586
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,490

Fiasco - Oh droid I did plug in a 12

590
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:02,810
Fiasco - Oh droid I did plug in a 12
 

591
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,439
Fiasco - Oh droid I did plug in a 12
volt power supply to an xu4 which is

592
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:05,449
volt power supply to an xu4 which is
 

593
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,540
volt power supply to an xu4 which is
supposed to have a 5 volt

594
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:07,550
supposed to have a 5 volt
 

595
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,600
supposed to have a 5 volt
I didn't realize and the board kept

596
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,610
I didn't realize and the board kept
 

597
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,020
I didn't realize and the board kept
working

598
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,030
working
 

599
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,860
working
but the regulator blue so it it was

600
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:14,870
but the regulator blue so it it was
 

601
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,590
but the regulator blue so it it was
wonky but still work I didn't release

602
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
wonky but still work I didn't release
 

603
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,170
wonky but still work I didn't release
the blue smoke so the regulator was on

604
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:20,180
the blue smoke so the regulator was on
 

605
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,870
the blue smoke so the regulator was on
the board though right yeah yeah so

606
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
the board though right yeah yeah so
 

607
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,420
the board though right yeah yeah so
could you replace the regulator or did

608
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,430
could you replace the regulator or did
 

609
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,819
could you replace the regulator or did
you just toss the board I still have the

610
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:27,829
you just toss the board I still have the
 

611
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:39,640
you just toss the board I still have the
board it's it's mark for me still I'm

612
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:39,650
board it's it's mark for me still I'm
 

613
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,100
board it's it's mark for me still I'm
still I'm still trying to figure out the

614
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,110
still I'm still trying to figure out the
 

615
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,500
still I'm still trying to figure out the
best um

616
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,510
best um
 

617
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,960
best um
I don't have a use case I don't think

618
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:46,970
I don't have a use case I don't think
 

619
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,800
I don't have a use case I don't think
for having multiple SPC's you know

620
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:50,810
for having multiple SPC's you know
 

621
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,040
for having multiple SPC's you know
deployed you say that because you

622
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,050
deployed you say that because you
 

623
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,430
deployed you say that because you
haven't played with convince me what I

624
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
haven't played with convince me what I
 

625
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,730
haven't played with convince me what I
got every time I see it in SPC whether

626
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:00,740
got every time I see it in SPC whether
 

627
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,580
got every time I see it in SPC whether
it be a rush retire or or no droid what

628
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:03,590
it be a rush retire or or no droid what
 

629
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,220
it be a rush retire or or no droid what
I see is idle in another Linux instance

630
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,230
I see is idle in another Linux instance
 

631
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,330
I see is idle in another Linux instance
right so you've got so we have this

632
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:10,340
right so you've got so we have this
 

633
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,360
right so you've got so we have this
mentality right now yeah bigger faster

634
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,370
mentality right now yeah bigger faster
 

635
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,390
mentality right now yeah bigger faster
stronger more powerful more RAM more

636
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
stronger more powerful more RAM more
 

637
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,460
stronger more powerful more RAM more
harddrive space that's our mentality of

638
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:18,470
harddrive space that's our mentality of
 

639
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,640
harddrive space that's our mentality of
server admins so I want a server that's

640
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:21,650
server admins so I want a server that's
 

641
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,270
server admins so I want a server that's
this big and this powerful and is able

642
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
this big and this powerful and is able
 

643
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,950
this big and this powerful and is able
to run a whole bunch of virtual machines

644
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
to run a whole bunch of virtual machines
 

645
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,690
to run a whole bunch of virtual machines
and a whole bunch of instances and a

646
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:28,700
and a whole bunch of instances and a
 

647
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,880
and a whole bunch of instances and a
whole bunch of tasks on that one piece

648
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:30,890
whole bunch of tasks on that one piece
 

649
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,670
whole bunch of tasks on that one piece
of equipment so was it rate yet I'm not

650
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:33,680
of equipment so was it rate yet I'm not
 

651
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,980
of equipment so was it rate yet I'm not
yeah yeah but I'm saying in general

652
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:35,990
yeah yeah but I'm saying in general
 

653
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,300
yeah yeah but I'm saying in general
that's kind of our mentality as a

654
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,310
that's kind of our mentality as a
 

655
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,700
that's kind of our mentality as a
industry so single board computers take

656
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:42,710
industry so single board computers take
 

657
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,740
industry so single board computers take
that and flip it on its head and say ok

658
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:44,750
that and flip it on its head and say ok
 

659
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,830
that and flip it on its head and say ok
let's take a different approach of this

660
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:46,840
let's take a different approach of this
 

661
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,090
let's take a different approach of this
heavy consumption device the traditional

662
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,100
heavy consumption device the traditional
 

663
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,520
heavy consumption device the traditional
server which draws a lot of power and

664
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,530
server which draws a lot of power and
 

665
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,340
server which draws a lot of power and
cost a lot of money comparatively to run

666
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,350
cost a lot of money comparatively to run
 

667
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,560
cost a lot of money comparatively to run
like the ongoing operating expenses and

668
00:18:59,560 --> 00:18:59,570
like the ongoing operating expenses and
 

669
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,670
like the ongoing operating expenses and
instead create single task devices that

670
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:03,680
instead create single task devices that
 

671
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,860
instead create single task devices that
are all individual Linux machines so

672
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:05,870
are all individual Linux machines so
 

673
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,890
are all individual Linux machines so
you've got a Raspberry Pi here that is

674
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:08,900
you've got a Raspberry Pi here that is
 

675
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,860
you've got a Raspberry Pi here that is
my DNS server so where this server could

676
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:11,870
my DNS server so where this server could
 

677
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,880
my DNS server so where this server could
be DNS website file serving virtual

678
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:15,890
be DNS website file serving virtual
 

679
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,900
be DNS website file serving virtual
machines everything else

680
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:16,910
machines everything else
 

681
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,580
machines everything else
well the Raspberry Pi is just my DNS

682
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:18,590
well the Raspberry Pi is just my DNS
 

683
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,960
well the Raspberry Pi is just my DNS
server and then you've got another one

684
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:19,970
server and then you've got another one
 

685
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,170
server and then you've got another one
that is just my upon stinson another one

686
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:23,180
that is just my upon stinson another one
 

687
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,390
that is just my upon stinson another one
that's my MySQL and MariaDB

688
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:25,400
that's my MySQL and MariaDB
 

689
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,390
that's my MySQL and MariaDB
so you've got purpose-built appliances

690
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
so you've got purpose-built appliances
 

691
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,290
so you've got purpose-built appliances
that take up a lot less energy they can

692
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:32,300
that take up a lot less energy they can
 

693
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,240
that take up a lot less energy they can
be powered by something like I'm talking

694
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,250
be powered by something like I'm talking
 

695
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,260
be powered by something like I'm talking
about like this step-down controller and

696
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,270
about like this step-down controller and
 

697
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,090
about like this step-down controller and
and they're purpose-built so if one goes

698
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,100
and they're purpose-built so if one goes
 

699
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,010
and they're purpose-built so if one goes
down you can just pop out the card pop

700
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,020
down you can just pop out the card pop
 

701
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,530
down you can just pop out the card pop
in another card and be back up and

702
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:44,540
in another card and be back up and
 

703
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,240
in another card and be back up and
running really really fast and it's only

704
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,250
running really really fast and it's only
 

705
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,320
running really really fast and it's only
that one service that goes down one I

706
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,330
that one service that goes down one I
 

707
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,880
that one service that goes down one I
said that so I could probably the

708
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:54,890
said that so I could probably the
 

709
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,680
said that so I could probably the
Blithedale yeah that probably

710
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:56,690
Blithedale yeah that probably
 

711
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,640
Blithedale yeah that probably
package said LM gem I told so I know

712
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:03,650
package said LM gem I told so I know
 

713
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,460
package said LM gem I told so I know
yeah that would that would makes it if

714
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:06,470
yeah that would that would makes it if
 

715
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,440
yeah that would that would makes it if
that was the putt Reagan Apple too much

716
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,450
that was the putt Reagan Apple too much
 

717
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:14,680
that was the putt Reagan Apple too much
to make creamy mostly I think that Billy

718
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:14,690
to make creamy mostly I think that Billy
 

719
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,090

they known on on the on the red lighter
 

757
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,310
they known on on the on the red lighter
you have to look for it on though and

758
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,320
you have to look for it on though and
 

759
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,040
you have to look for it on though and
they should be red normal like lighter

760
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,050
they should be red normal like lighter

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,210
pie hole is able to operate in a in a
 

929
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,530
pie hole is able to operate in a in a
like firm fashion but it's not actually

00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:57,540
like firm fashion but it's not actually
 

931
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,990
like firm fashion but it's not actually
built into the micro tech it's a rule

932
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
built into the micro tech it's a rule
 

933
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,750
built into the micro tech it's a rule
the reroutes the traffic to the pie hole

934
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:02,760
the reroutes the traffic to the pie hole
 

935
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,240
the reroutes the traffic to the pie hole
and I was looking back at my notes at

936
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,250
and I was looking back at my notes at
 

937
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,930
and I was looking back at my notes at
the new Netgear router that I that I

938
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:07,940
the new Netgear router that I that I
 

939
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,090
the new Netgear router that I that I
purchased a few months ago to replace

940
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,100
purchased a few months ago to replace
 

941
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,780
purchased a few months ago to replace
the old Nikki router and you were making

942
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:14,790
the old Nikki router and you were making
 

943
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,360
the old Nikki router and you were making
a point that the that the firmware on

944
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,370
a point that the that the firmware on
 

945
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,540
a point that the that the firmware on
the routers is is proprietary and closed

946
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:20,550
the routers is is proprietary and closed
 

947
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,420
the routers is is proprietary and closed
and I did that because looking back

948
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:23,430
and I did that because looking back
 

949
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,750
and I did that because looking back
through my notes and realized that

950
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
through my notes and realized that
 

951
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,600
through my notes and realized that
the router would not even come online

952
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:30,610
the router would not even come online
 

953
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,410
the router would not even come online
until it had phoned home you held my

954
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:34,420
until it had phoned home you held my
 

955
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,590
until it had phoned home you held my
hand yeah that was one but I mean I

956
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
hand yeah that was one but I mean I
 

957
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,810
hand yeah that was one but I mean I
didn't return that I kept that I kept it

958
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:39,820
didn't return that I kept that I kept it
 

959
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,990
didn't return that I kept that I kept it
down you know you have to fight you have

960
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,000
down you know you have to fight you have
 

961
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,600
down you know you have to fight you have
to select an admin password right that's

962
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:45,610
to select an admin password right that's
 

963
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,360
to select an admin password right that's
not the default password and then it

964
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,370
not the default password and then it
 

965
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,830
not the default password and then it
found home hmm I wonder if China knows

966
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:52,840
found home hmm I wonder if China knows
 

967
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,450
found home hmm I wonder if China knows
my you know it bugs me

968
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:57,460
my you know it bugs me
 

969
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,210
my you know it bugs me
it bugs me where no that is a little bit

970
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,220
it bugs me where no that is a little bit
 

971
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,280
it bugs me where no that is a little bit
on the other side don't be at all

972
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,290
on the other side don't be at all
 

973
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,500
on the other side don't be at all
surprised and this is an it dear I

974
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:04,510
surprised and this is an it dear I
 

975
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,570
surprised and this is an it dear I
probably should I don't care I've said

976
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:06,580
probably should I don't care I've said
 

977
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,940
probably should I don't care I've said
it already it was a it was a you know

978
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:08,950
it already it was a it was a you know
 

979
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,930
it already it was a it was a you know
well known new router so yeah but the

980
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:12,940
well known new router so yeah but the
 

981
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,180
well known new router so yeah but the
net years traditionally are pretty good

982
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,190
net years traditionally are pretty good
 

983
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,910
net years traditionally are pretty good
for having third-party firmware support

984
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:17,920
for having third-party firmware support
 

985
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,460
for having third-party firmware support
as well I mentioned tomato and dd-wrt

986
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,470
as well I mentioned tomato and dd-wrt
 

987
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,120
as well I mentioned tomato and dd-wrt
yeah no dd-wrt usually finds

988
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,130
yeah no dd-wrt usually finds
 

989
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,580
yeah no dd-wrt usually finds
compatibility on neck dear devices so

990
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:26,590
compatibility on neck dear devices so
 

991
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,470
compatibility on neck dear devices so
you could always reflash with an

992
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
you could always reflash with an
 

993
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,370
you could always reflash with an
open-source router firmware so how

994
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:32,380
open-source router firmware so how
 

995
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,990
open-source router firmware so how
comfortable one of the things I would

996
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
comfortable one of the things I would
 

997
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,960
comfortable one of the things I would
love to do would be to re-enable SSH

998
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:36,970
love to do would be to re-enable SSH
 

999
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,550
love to do would be to re-enable SSH
access by I've talked about that before

1000
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:41,560
access by I've talked about that before
 

1001
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,740
access by I've talked about that before
I pick a port number that's really high

1002
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:43,750
I pick a port number that's really high
 

1003
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,830
I pick a port number that's really high
in the range and then that that allows

1004
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:46,840
in the range and then that that allows
 

1005
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,550
in the range and then that that allows
me to ss-18 back to the house yeah from

1006
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:50,560
me to ss-18 back to the house yeah from
 

1007
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,860
me to ss-18 back to the house yeah from
any laptop right but my question to you

1008
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:52,870
any laptop right but my question to you
 

1009
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,720
any laptop right but my question to you
is how solid does the router have to be

1010
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:56,730
is how solid does the router have to be
 

1011
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,460
is how solid does the router have to be
consumer or or otherwise or Enterprise

1012
00:27:59,460 --> 00:27:59,470
consumer or or otherwise or Enterprise
 

1013
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,640
consumer or or otherwise or Enterprise
Reata what are the what a little the the

1014
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:02,650
Reata what are the what a little the the
 

1015
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,820
Reata what are the what a little the the
what are the things you look for because

1016
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:05,830
what are the things you look for because
 

1017
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,320
what are the things you look for because
one of the things I'm thinking of doing

1018
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,330
one of the things I'm thinking of doing
 

1019
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,090
one of the things I'm thinking of doing
is taking the u-verse modem and

1020
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,100
is taking the u-verse modem and
 

1021
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,860
is taking the u-verse modem and
literally just bridging it we talked

1022
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:10,870
literally just bridging it we talked
 

1023
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,930
literally just bridging it we talked
about you've talked about that I've

1024
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:12,940
about you've talked about that I've
 

1025
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,620
about you've talked about that I've
never tried it but that router as long

1026
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,630
never tried it but that router as long
 

1027
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,330
never tried it but that router as long
as it's not breached at least provides

1028
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:18,340
as it's not breached at least provides
 

1029
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,610
as it's not breached at least provides
some protection it does not allow for

1030
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:20,620
some protection it does not allow for
 

1031
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,240
some protection it does not allow for
instance the SSH incoming connection to

1034
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:26,890
come in I can't brain I can't do it I've
 

1035
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,490
come in I can't brain I can't do it I've
tried I've tried I can't do it it seems

1036
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:29,500
tried I've tried I can't do it it seems
 

1037
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,610
tried I've tried I can't do it it seems
like the only solution is to bridge the

1038
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:32,620
like the only solution is to bridge the
 

1039
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,580
like the only solution is to bridge the
repair the modem to my router but the

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:35,590
repair the modem to my router but the
 

1041
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,100
repair the modem to my router but the
routers taking the brunt of all of all

1042
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,110
routers taking the brunt of all of all
 

1043
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,530
routers taking the brunt of all of all
all the hits now because yeah once

1044
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:40,540
all the hits now because yeah once
 

1045
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,490
all the hits now because yeah once
you've bridge them

1046
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:41,500
you've bridge them
 

1047
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,160
you've bridge them
you're not yeah it's not offering any

1048
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,170
you're not yeah it's not offering any
 

1049
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:50,150
you're not yeah it's not offering any
protection at all right yeah you went

1050
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,160
protection at all right yeah you went
 

1051
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,950
protection at all right yeah you went
now you'd say it's all quiet

1052
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
now you'd say it's all quiet
 

1053
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,110
now you'd say it's all quiet
yep and we're right we're right out of

1054
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
yep and we're right we're right out of
 

1055
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,420
yep and we're right we're right out of
time too but I'll just kind of in final

1056
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:57,430
time too but I'll just kind of in final
 

1057
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,800
time too but I'll just kind of in final
thoughts in response to that vp9

1058
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:00,810
thoughts in response to that vp9
 

1059
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,540
thoughts in response to that vp9
the the interesting thing there is by

1060
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:03,550
the the interesting thing there is by
 

1061
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,910
the the interesting thing there is by
bridging your modem and instead tapping

1062
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:05,920
bridging your modem and instead tapping
 

1063
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,340
bridging your modem and instead tapping
into a proper firewall device I'm

1064
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:08,350
into a proper firewall device I'm
 

1065
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,350
into a proper firewall device I'm
thinking along the lines of the micro

1066
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:10,360
thinking along the lines of the micro
 

1067
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,910
thinking along the lines of the micro
tech the mikrotik has a specific type of

1068
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:14,920
tech the mikrotik has a specific type of
 

1069
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,610
tech the mikrotik has a specific type of
processor and specific software in place

1070
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:17,620
processor and specific software in place
 

1071
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,950
processor and specific software in place
that's meant to be able to withstand

1072
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:19,960
that's meant to be able to withstand
 

1073
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,130
that's meant to be able to withstand
those types of attacks so suddenly your

1074
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,140
those types of attacks so suddenly your
 

1075
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,230
those types of attacks so suddenly your
modem is not getting the attacks and

1076
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,240
modem is not getting the attacks and
 

1077
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,840
modem is not getting the attacks and
it's not as good of a quality device so

1078
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:27,850
it's not as good of a quality device so
 

1079
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,680
it's not as good of a quality device so
it's not going to lock up instead your

1080
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:30,690
it's not going to lock up instead your
 

1081
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,030
it's not going to lock up instead your
micro tech for example will be able to

1082
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,040
micro tech for example will be able to
 

1083
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,820
micro tech for example will be able to
reject those those not wanted packets

1084
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:38,830
reject those those not wanted packets
 

1085
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,400
reject those those not wanted packets
but a lot of it I could configure the

1086
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,410
but a lot of it I could configure the
 

1087
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,170
but a lot of it I could configure the
NIC me rather to do the same thing

1088
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:43,180
NIC me rather to do the same thing
 

1089
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,540
NIC me rather to do the same thing
quite possibly yeah so we're where the

1090
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:45,550
quite possibly yeah so we're where the
 

1091
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,310
quite possibly yeah so we're where the
mikrotik I think is going to stand out

1092
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,320
mikrotik I think is going to stand out
 

1093
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,520
mikrotik I think is going to stand out
in that regard is that rather than DMZ

1094
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:50,530
in that regard is that rather than DMZ
 

1095
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,820
in that regard is that rather than DMZ
in port 22 which basically means opening

1096
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:53,830
in port 22 which basically means opening
 

1097
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,500
in port 22 which basically means opening
it up to the world because you want to

1098
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:55,510
it up to the world because you want to
 

1099
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,330
it up to the world because you want to
be able to access it you can set it to

1100
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:57,340
be able to access it you can set it to
 

1101
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,940
be able to access it you can set it to
only allow your MAC address or only

1102
00:29:59,940 --> 00:29:59,950
only allow your MAC address or only
 

1103
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,670
only allow your MAC address or only
allow your IP address or simply say I'll

1104
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:02,680
allow your IP address or simply say I'll
 

1105
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,710
allow your IP address or simply say I'll
allow anyone to connect to that port

1106
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
allow anyone to connect to that port
 

1107
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,250
allow anyone to connect to that port
whatever the the public port is but not

1108
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:08,260
whatever the the public port is but not
 

1109
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,810
whatever the the public port is but not
if they're from China or anywhere like

1110
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:09,820
if they're from China or anywhere like
 

1111
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,980
if they're from China or anywhere like
that you can set up a demo like

1112
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:12,990
that you can set up a demo like
 

1113
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,380
that you can set up a demo like
geographic regions for where is allowed

1114
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:16,390
geographic regions for where is allowed
 

1115
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,060
geographic regions for where is allowed
to connect through that port in your

1116
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,070
to connect through that port in your
 

1117
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,480
to connect through that port in your
mikrotik router so so that's that's you

1118
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:21,490
mikrotik router so so that's that's you
 

1119
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,430
mikrotik router so so that's that's you
know it's good when you know I'm not

1120
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,440
know it's good when you know I'm not
 

1121
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,130
know it's good when you know I'm not
gonna be traveling outside the US so I

1122
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,140
gonna be traveling outside the US so I
 

1123
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,990
gonna be traveling outside the US so I
will open this port but I'm only going

1124
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,000
will open this port but I'm only going
 

1125
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,680
will open this port but I'm only going
to open it for the US and that was so I

1126
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:31,690
to open it for the US and that was so I
 

1127
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,860
to open it for the US and that was so I
do tricks to to Australia every now and

1128
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:34,870
do tricks to to Australia every now and
 

1129
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:40,830
do tricks to to Australia every now and
again and I can I can open it up for

1130
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:40,840
again and I can I can open it up for
 

1131
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,100
again and I can I can open it up for
Australia right and only for the

1132
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,110
Australia right and only for the
 

1133
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,370
Australia right and only for the
duration of the trip otherwise you won't

1134
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:47,380
duration of the trip otherwise you won't
 

1135
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,830
duration of the trip otherwise you won't
get out to everybody you tipped the

1136
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
get out to everybody you tipped the
 

1137
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,690
get out to everybody you tipped the
other option and what I've set up in the

1138
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:51,700
other option and what I've set up in the
 

1139
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,230
other option and what I've set up in the
past is having SSH key

1140
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,240
past is having SSH key
 

1141
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,540
past is having SSH key
being set up that was able to

1142
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:57,550
being set up that was able to
 

1143
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,450
being set up that was able to
communicate yeah but but to actually

1144
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:00,460
communicate yeah but but to actually
 

1145
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,860
communicate yeah but but to actually
communicate and authenticate to allow

1146
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:03,870
communicate and authenticate to allow
 

1147
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,780
communicate and authenticate to allow
access to the port using that

1148
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:06,790
access to the port using that
 

1149
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,240
access to the port using that
authentication so prett from the

1150
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,250
authentication so prett from the
 

1151
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,520
authentication so prett from the
essential benefit yes and not even for

1152
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,530
essential benefit yes and not even for
 

1153
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,890
essential benefit yes and not even for
the connection itself but just to be

1154
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:13,900
the connection itself but just to be
 

1155
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,250
the connection itself but just to be
able to allow access through the port it

1156
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:17,260
able to allow access through the port it
 

1157
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,620
able to allow access through the port it
has to authenticate using my key so

1158
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:19,630
has to authenticate using my key so
 

1159
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,810
has to authenticate using my key so
there's just no limit to the security of

1160
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:21,820
there's just no limit to the security of
 

1161
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,390
there's just no limit to the security of
something like a mikrotik so but that's

1162
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:24,400
something like a mikrotik so but that's
 

1163
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,340
something like a mikrotik so but that's
all the time that we have I or I think

1164
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:26,350
all the time that we have I or I think
 

1165
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,740
all the time that we have I or I think
maybe we should start we can start one

1166
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:28,750
maybe we should start we can start one
 

1167
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,590
maybe we should start we can start one
of these with with some great nerdy

1168
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
of these with with some great nerdy
 

1169
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,590
of these with with some great nerdy
stuff and then do that and then we don't

1170
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:34,600
stuff and then do that and then we don't
 

1171
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,930
stuff and then do that and then we don't
get cut off well let my string came to

1172
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:36,940
get cut off well let my string came to
 

1173
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,549
get cut off well let my string came to
me you know yeah let's rip it up the

1174
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:41,559
me you know yeah let's rip it up the
