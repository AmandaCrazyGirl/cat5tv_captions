that is that I've read and the
 

159
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:09,209
that is that I've read and the
technician has confirmed that it also

160
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:09,219
technician has confirmed that it also
 

161
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:13,959
technician has confirmed that it also
publishes a feat to AT&T publishes the

162
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:13,969
publishes a feat to AT&T publishes the
 

163
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,390
publishes a feat to AT&T publishes the
MAC addresses of all the devices inside

164
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
MAC addresses of all the devices inside
 

165
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,159
MAC addresses of all the devices inside
my private network so for that reason I

166
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:20,169
my private network so for that reason I
 

167
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:26,800
my private network so for that reason I
have a I have a Nikia rather

168
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:26,810

 

169
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,320

is the only thing that's attached to the

170
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,330
is the only thing that's attached to the
 

171
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,460
is the only thing that's attached to the
modem and I connect everything via the

172
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,470
modem and I connect everything via the
 

173
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,490
modem and I connect everything via the
net next year router and or other

174
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,500
net next year router and or other
 

175
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,440
net next year router and or other
rabbits that are in internal to the

176
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,450
rabbits that are in internal to the
 

177
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,460
rabbits that are in internal to the
house the only thing that the modem

178
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,470
house the only thing that the modem
 

179
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,150
house the only thing that the modem
knows about is the net gear here and

180
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
knows about is the net gear here and
 

181
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,010
knows about is the net gear here and
that's the ugly MAC address and poison

182
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,020
that's the ugly MAC address and poison
 

183
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,680
that's the ugly MAC address and poison
that's the only MAC address that it

184
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:50,690
that's the only MAC address that it
 

185
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,760
that's the only MAC address that it
publishes right assuming that it's I

186
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:53,770
publishes right assuming that it's I
 

187
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,350
publishes right assuming that it's I
have no reason to believe it doesn't do

188
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,360
have no reason to believe it doesn't do
 

189
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,170
have no reason to believe it doesn't do
that so so yeah okay so here's my here's

190
00:04:59,170 --> 00:04:59,180
that so so yeah okay so here's my here's
 

191
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,810
that so so yeah okay so here's my here's
my thing the other thing that prevents

192
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:01,820
my thing the other thing that prevents
 

193
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,909
my thing the other thing that prevents
because of the fact that it doesn't

194
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
because of the fact that it doesn't
 

195
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,810
because of the fact that it doesn't
allow any kind of the modem provides the

196
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:07,820
allow any kind of the modem provides the
 

197
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,760
allow any kind of the modem provides the
firewall in terms of it doesn't allow

198
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:09,770
firewall in terms of it doesn't allow
 

199
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,980
firewall in terms of it doesn't allow
any kind of network connection incoming

200
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:13,990
any kind of network connection incoming
 

201
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,110
any kind of network connection incoming
by the way as you've already mentioned

202
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
by the way as you've already mentioned
 

203
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,379
by the way as you've already mentioned
in previous coffee breaks it does also

204
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:23,389
in previous coffee breaks it does also
 

205
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,540
in previous coffee breaks it does also
you know the modem provides for a 5 5

206
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,550
you know the modem provides for a 5 5
 

207
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,300
you know the modem provides for a 5 5
gigahertz and a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi

208
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,310
gigahertz and a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi
 

209
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,730
gigahertz and a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi
connection that I do not use for the

210
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:33,740
connection that I do not use for the
 

211
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,450
connection that I do not use for the
same reason I let the internal Netgear

212
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:37,460
same reason I let the internal Netgear
 

213
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,700
same reason I let the internal Netgear
router do all that for me it too offers

214
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:39,710
router do all that for me it too offers
 

215
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,440
router do all that for me it too offers
5g and 5 you could 5 gigahertz and 2.4

216
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:44,450
5g and 5 you could 5 gigahertz and 2.4
 

217
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,090
5g and 5 you could 5 gigahertz and 2.4
gigahertz Wi-Fi internal so I control

218
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,100
gigahertz Wi-Fi internal so I control
 

219
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,330
gigahertz Wi-Fi internal so I control
that as much as I possibly can right but

220
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,340
that as much as I possibly can right but
 

221
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,870
that as much as I possibly can right but
what I'm trying to understand and I

222
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:55,880
what I'm trying to understand and I
 

223
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,550
what I'm trying to understand and I
think I've done all that I can

224
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:57,560
think I've done all that I can
 

225
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,659
think I've done all that I can
reasonably do to make that happen now

226
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:00,669
reasonably do to make that happen now
 

227
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,760
reasonably do to make that happen now
disabled the Wi-Fi modems in there the

228
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:03,770
disabled the Wi-Fi modems in there the
 

229
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,090
disabled the Wi-Fi modems in there the
Wi-Fi access points in the actual

230
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,100
Wi-Fi access points in the actual
 

231
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,570
Wi-Fi access points in the actual
internet provider yeah provided device

232
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:10,580
internet provider yeah provided device
 

233
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,290
internet provider yeah provided device
and I'm using all or all of my accesses

234
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,300
and I'm using all or all of my accesses
 

235
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,340
and I'm using all or all of my accesses
is through the internal routers yeah so

236
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,350
is through the internal routers yeah so
 

237
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,760
is through the internal routers yeah so
I've done all I can I think reasonably

238
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:21,770
I've done all I can I think reasonably
 

239
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,010
I've done all I can I think reasonably
to actually make all that work I've done

240
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,020
to actually make all that work I've done
 

241
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,840
to actually make all that work I've done
all kinds of other stuff like you know

242
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:25,850
all kinds of other stuff like you know
 

243
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,279
all kinds of other stuff like you know
if I don't know the MAC address of the

244
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,289
if I don't know the MAC address of the
 

245
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,770
if I don't know the MAC address of the
device it just simply won't connect to

246
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:29,780
device it just simply won't connect to
 

247
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,469
device it just simply won't connect to
the even the internal network stuff like

248
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
the even the internal network stuff like
 

249
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,370
the even the internal network stuff like
that yeah so you know I feel like I'd

250
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:36,380
that yeah so you know I feel like I'd
 

251
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,870
that yeah so you know I feel like I'd
feel like it's pretty good but here's

252
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:37,880
feel like it's pretty good but here's
 

253
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,500
feel like it's pretty good but here's
the thing

254
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,510
the thing
 

255
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,910
the thing
one thing I can

256
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:39,920
one thing I can
 

257
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,370
one thing I can
as I mentioned in yesterday's coffee

258
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:42,380
as I mentioned in yesterday's coffee
 

259
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,320
as I mentioned in yesterday's coffee
break is that I cannot allow for any

260
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,330
break is that I cannot allow for any
 

261
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,760
break is that I cannot allow for any
kind of I cannot SSH in I used to be

262
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:51,770
kind of I cannot SSH in I used to be
 

263
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,940
kind of I cannot SSH in I used to be
able to do on my old DSL I used to be

264
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:54,950
able to do on my old DSL I used to be
 

265
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,570
able to do on my old DSL I used to be
able to SSH in by port forwarding yeah

266
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:58,580
able to SSH in by port forwarding yeah
 

267
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,880
able to SSH in by port forwarding yeah
but the modem does not allow that the

268
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:00,890
but the modem does not allow that the
 

269
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,610
but the modem does not allow that the
the Internet service provider provided

270
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:03,620
the Internet service provider provided
 

271
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,070
the Internet service provider provided
modem does not allow for RAM for that

272
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
modem does not allow for RAM for that
 

273
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,450
modem does not allow for RAM for that
kind of port forwarding yeah and it

274
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:10,460
kind of port forwarding yeah and it
 

275
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,150
kind of port forwarding yeah and it
sounds like from from all the forums

276
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,160
sounds like from from all the forums
 

277
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,100
sounds like from from all the forums
that I've read and all that it sounds

278
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,110
that I've read and all that it sounds
 

279
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,860
that I've read and all that it sounds
like my only option really is to what's

280
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:17,870
like my only option really is to what's
 

281
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,470
like my only option really is to what's
called air bleeds to modem and if I do

282
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:20,480
called air bleeds to modem and if I do
 

283
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,120
called air bleeds to modem and if I do
that my concern then becomes okay the

284
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,130
that my concern then becomes okay the
 

285
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,400
that my concern then becomes okay the
internet service provider modem is is my

286
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,410
internet service provider modem is is my
 

287
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,750
internet service provider modem is is my
first wall of defense

288
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:31,760
first wall of defense
 

289
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,600
first wall of defense
right it's at least stopping incoming

290
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,610
right it's at least stopping incoming
 

291
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,380
right it's at least stopping incoming
connections for which I'm grateful my

292
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,390
connections for which I'm grateful my
 

293
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,970
connections for which I'm grateful my
internal router is also set up to do the

294
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:39,980
internal router is also set up to do the
 

295
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,790
internal router is also set up to do the
same right but at which point you know

296
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:45,800
same right but at which point you know
 

297
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,690
same right but at which point you know
how do you so how do you decide yeah I

298
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:49,700
how do you so how do you decide yeah I
 

299
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,970
how do you so how do you decide yeah I
understand a deer rabbit is strong

300
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:51,980
understand a deer rabbit is strong
 

301
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,580
understand a deer rabbit is strong
enough or you know whatever rally you've

302
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,590
enough or you know whatever rally you've
 

303
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,040
enough or you know whatever rally you've
got is strong enough to be able to do

304
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,050
got is strong enough to be able to do
 

305
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,810
got is strong enough to be able to do
what the to do what the AT&T modems

306
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:01,820
what the to do what the AT&T modems
 

307
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,950
what the to do what the AT&T modems
doing for me already

308
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
doing for me already
 

309
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,510
doing for me already
you've just that's really kind of dual

310
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:04,520
you've just that's really kind of dual
 

311
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,080
you've just that's really kind of dual
firewall yeah right yeah yeah so that's

312
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,090
firewall yeah right yeah yeah so that's
 

313
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,930
firewall yeah right yeah yeah so that's
good you know mikrotik and i understand

314
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:10,940
good you know mikrotik and i understand
 

315
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,410
good you know mikrotik and i understand
why but at the same time get that it's

316
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:14,420
why but at the same time get that it's
 

317
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,900
why but at the same time get that it's
not open source but at least an open

318
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:16,910
not open source but at least an open
 

319
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,810
not open source but at least an open
operating system then hopefully does not

320
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:19,820
operating system then hopefully does not
 

321
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,880
operating system then hopefully does not
phone home

322
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:21,890
phone home
 

323
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,800
phone home
that's the that's the biggest concern I

324
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:23,810
that's the that's the biggest concern I
 

325
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,840
that's the that's the biggest concern I
have you know what all was it doing when

326
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,850
have you know what all was it doing when
 

327
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,730
have you know what all was it doing when
it's phoning home right and so I are you

328
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:30,740
it's phoning home right and so I are you
 

329
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,430
it's phoning home right and so I are you
notice that I get that not like that

330
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
notice that I get that not like that
 

331
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,430
notice that I get that not like that
I don't care home I already know the

332
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:36,440
I don't care home I already know the
 

333
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,200
I don't care home I already know the
Internet Service Providers is

334
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,210
Internet Service Providers is
 

335
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,850
Internet Service Providers is
transparently looking at everything I do

336
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:39,860
transparently looking at everything I do
 

337
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,670
transparently looking at everything I do
I can't and that's my concern vp9 that's

338
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:42,680
I can't and that's my concern vp9 that's
 

339
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,760
I can't and that's my concern vp9 that's
my concern and like your so anyone who's

340
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:45,770
my concern and like your so anyone who's
 

341
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,040
my concern and like your so anyone who's
watching this on demand later like you

342
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,050
watching this on demand later like you
 

343
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,860
watching this on demand later like you
know that your your modem

344
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:53,870
know that your your modem
 

345
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,870
know that your your modem
doing that you understand that they're

346
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:55,880
doing that you understand that they're
 

347
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,230
doing that you understand that they're
monitoring graphic and connected devices

348
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,240
monitoring graphic and connected devices
 

349
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,420
monitoring graphic and connected devices
and all those kinds of things are you're

350
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:01,430
and all those kinds of things are you're
 

351
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,150
and all those kinds of things are you're
fixing it but the average Joe user just

352
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
fixing it but the average Joe user just
 

353
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,170
fixing it but the average Joe user just
plugs in their modem and I know is it

354
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,180
plugs in their modem and I know is it
 

355
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,990
plugs in their modem and I know is it
even people at work at work a couple of

356
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,000
even people at work at work a couple of
 

357
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,780
even people at work at work a couple of
couple of jobs ago yeah do the same

358
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:13,790
couple of jobs ago yeah do the same
 

359
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,519
couple of jobs ago yeah do the same
thing and I said why are you doing that

360
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:15,529
thing and I said why are you doing that
 

361
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:19,740
thing and I said why are you doing that
don't you know that this modem the

362
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:19,750
don't you know that this modem the
 

363
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,290
don't you know that this modem the
publishing back to to the provider

364
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,300
publishing back to to the provider
 

365
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,450
publishing back to to the provider
oh not only that devices that are on

366
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,460
oh not only that devices that are on
 

367
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,670
oh not only that devices that are on
your network on your internal private

368
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
your network on your internal private
 

369
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
your network on your internal private
yeah yeah yeah yeah but not only that

370
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:29,690
yeah yeah yeah yeah but not only that
 

371
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,060
yeah yeah yeah yeah but not only that
but also quite often as is the case with

372
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,070
but also quite often as is the case with
 

373
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,519
but also quite often as is the case with
the ISP for the internet at the studio

374
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:36,529
the ISP for the internet at the studio
 

375
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,290
the ISP for the internet at the studio
so when they installed them the Internet

376
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:38,300
so when they installed them the Internet
 

377
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,230
so when they installed them the Internet
they said they have remote access to the

378
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
they said they have remote access to the
 

379
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,380
they said they have remote access to the
router sure I said and I said well

380
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,390
router sure I said and I said well
 

381
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,570
router sure I said and I said well
disable that to the modem right

382
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,580
disable that to the modem right
 

383
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,420
disable that to the modem right
the modem it has a built-in router yes

384
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,430
the modem it has a built-in router yes
 

385
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,180
the modem it has a built-in router yes
okay so be careful because when you say

386
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,190
okay so be careful because when you say
 

387
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,360
okay so be careful because when you say
router you might infer that you're

388
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,370
router you might infer that you're
 

389
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,040
router you might infer that you're
talking about an internal router my

390
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,050
talking about an internal router my
 

391
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,280
talking about an internal router my
internal I don't have it no no no no

392
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,290
internal I don't have it no no no no
 

393
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,019
internal I don't have it no no no no
right your your modem has a built-in

394
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:05,029
right your your modem has a built-in
 

395
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,420
right your your modem has a built-in
router yes that's house and it has a

396
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,430
router yes that's house and it has a
 

397
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,820
router yes that's house and it has a
DHCP server and a firewall Brian right

398
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,830
DHCP server and a firewall Brian right
 

399
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,510
DHCP server and a firewall Brian right
right so the modem is is basically a

400
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:13,520
right so the modem is is basically a
 

401
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,100
right so the modem is is basically a
chip that's what gives you the

402
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,110
chip that's what gives you the
 

403
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,840
chip that's what gives you the
connection and then you have the the

404
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:16,850
connection and then you have the the
 

405
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,329
connection and then you have the the
router is what's actually routing the

406
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:19,339
router is what's actually routing the
 

407
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:21,400
router is what's actually routing the
traffic to the ethernet ports on the

408
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,410
traffic to the ethernet ports on the
 

409
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,470
traffic to the ethernet ports on the
back of that modem which is also a

410
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:23,480
back of that modem which is also a
 

411
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,140
back of that modem which is also a
router right so yeah but but because

412
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,150
router right so yeah but but because
 

413
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,180
router right so yeah but but because
they have remote access to it they can

414
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,190
they have remote access to it they can
 

415
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,100
they have remote access to it they can
actually access not only my modem and

416
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,110
actually access not only my modem and
 

417
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,000
actually access not only my modem and
router but my computer my Samba shares

418
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,010
router but my computer my Samba shares
 

419
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,970
router but my computer my Samba shares
my files they can access those things

420
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:36,980
my files they can access those things
 

421
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,949
my files they can access those things
they could defeat would if it were

422
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
they could defeat would if it were
 

423
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,769
they could defeat would if it were
directly connected to the Internet

424
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:41,779
directly connected to the Internet
 

425
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,390
directly connected to the Internet
provides I'm talking about yeah I'm

426
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:43,400
provides I'm talking about yeah I'm
 

427
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,340
provides I'm talking about yeah I'm
talking about the average user who just

428
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,350
talking about the average user who just
 

429
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,290
talking about the average user who just
allows them to install the modem and

430
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:47,300
allows them to install the modem and
 

431
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,079
allows them to install the modem and
then just goes along using it as is

432
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:50,089
then just goes along using it as is
 

433
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:51,460
then just goes along using it as is
you're not the average user because

434
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:51,470
you're not the average user because
 

435
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,290
you're not the average user because
you've supplemented that with it with

436
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:53,300
you've supplemented that with it with
 

437
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,199
you've supplemented that with it with
this neck here right so as far as

438
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:56,209
this neck here right so as far as
 

439
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,750
this neck here right so as far as
bridging goes usually and I always

440
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:58,760
bridging goes usually and I always
 

441
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,340
bridging goes usually and I always
bridge my modem because I don't want my

442
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,350
bridge my modem because I don't want my
 

443
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,650
bridge my modem because I don't want my
ISP having any access to my network

444
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:02,660
ISP having any access to my network
 

445
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,270
ISP having any access to my network
period

446
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,280

 

447
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,610

but the as far as the the first line of

448
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:07,620
but the as far as the the first line of
 

449
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,400
but the as far as the the first line of
defense goes but I I would just try

450
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,410
defense goes but I I would just try
 

451
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,570
defense goes but I I would just try
bridging the modem because usually

452
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:11,580
bridging the modem because usually
 

453
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,440
bridging the modem because usually
there's you usually have the capability

454
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,450
there's you usually have the capability
 

455
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,000
there's you usually have the capability
to just press a reset button and that'll

456
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,010
to just press a reset button and that'll
 

457
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,770
to just press a reset button and that'll
take it back to its normal factory

458
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:18,780
take it back to its normal factory
 

459
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,120
take it back to its normal factory
default settings anyway so you can

460
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,130
default settings anyway so you can
 

461
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,160
default settings anyway so you can
always experiment with it and see so I

462
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,170
always experiment with it and see so I
 

463
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,600
always experiment with it and see so I
figured that after G but you know what

464
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,610
figured that after G but you know what
 

465
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,190
figured that after G but you know what
you've gotten you have this situation

466
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,200
you've gotten you have this situation
 

467
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,500
you've gotten you have this situation
where you've got two firewalls so your

468
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:30,510
where you've got two firewalls so your
 

469
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,140
where you've got two firewalls so your
first line of defense is the ISPs modem

470
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,150
first line of defense is the ISPs modem
 

471
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,600
first line of defense is the ISPs modem
you're sure yeah so can you not set up a

472
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,610
you're sure yeah so can you not set up a
 

473
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,500
you're sure yeah so can you not set up a
port trigger or port redirection on that

474
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,510
port trigger or port redirection on that
 

475
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,830
port trigger or port redirection on that
motorbike I tried it on the modem and it

476
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:42,840
motorbike I tried it on the modem and it
 

477
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,550
motorbike I tried it on the modem and it
just won't work

478
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,560
just won't work
 

479
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,240
just won't work
and so I checked on various forums yeah

480
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,250
and so I checked on various forums yeah
 

481
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,250
and so I checked on various forums yeah
who you know various Google searches or

482
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,260
who you know various Google searches or
 

483
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,410
who you know various Google searches or
whatever and they say the only way to

484
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,420
whatever and they say the only way to
 

485
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,170
whatever and they say the only way to
get around this is it's to breach the

486
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,180
get around this is it's to breach the
 

487
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,350
get around this is it's to breach the
modem restriction because you have to

488
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
modem restriction because you have to
 

489
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,780
modem restriction because you have to
you've got a dual firewall set up so you

490
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:05,790
you've got a dual firewall set up so you
 

491
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,360
you've got a dual firewall set up so you
have to have your if you don't bridge

492
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,370
have to have your if you don't bridge
 

493
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,120
have to have your if you don't bridge
the modem you have to have your firewall

494
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,130
the modem you have to have your firewall
 

495
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,430
the modem you have to have your firewall
built into the modem pointing to the net

496
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
built into the modem pointing to the net
 

497
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,190
built into the modem pointing to the net
gear and opening port 22 then you have

498
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,200
gear and opening port 22 then you have
 

499
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,620
gear and opening port 22 then you have
to have the net gear picking up on port

500
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:18,630
to have the net gear picking up on port
 

501
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,310
to have the net gear picking up on port
20 on port 22 and then rerouting it to

502
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
20 on port 22 and then rerouting it to
 

503
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,130
20 on port 22 and then rerouting it to
your internal IP because I a so says

504
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:25,140
your internal IP because I a so says
 

505
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,710
your internal IP because I a so says
annoying that's the set up but used to

506
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:27,720
annoying that's the set up but used to
 

507
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,010
annoying that's the set up but used to
do with the old DSL modem yeah I had an

508
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,020
do with the old DSL modem yeah I had an
 

509
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,480
do with the old DSL modem yeah I had an
old DSL modem prior to the treatment you

510
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,490
old DSL modem prior to the treatment you
 

511
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,980
old DSL modem prior to the treatment you
verse modem and the universe is

512
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:38,990
verse modem and the universe is
 

513
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,390
verse modem and the universe is
considerably more complicated because as

514
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:41,400
considerably more complicated because as
 

515
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,180
considerably more complicated because as
you say it has a router built-in so if I

516
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,190
you say it has a router built-in so if I
 

517
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,390
you say it has a router built-in so if I
think that if I were to default to port

518
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:50,400
think that if I were to default to port
 

519
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,780
think that if I were to default to port
22 it might work but I'm deliberately

520
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:53,790
22 it might work but I'm deliberately
 

521
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,050
22 it might work but I'm deliberately
not using any - oh you can use whatever

522
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,060
not using any - oh you can use whatever
 

523
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,380
not using any - oh you can use whatever
your I discussed notified not if I want

524
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,390
your I discussed notified not if I want
 

525
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,250
your I discussed notified not if I want
to hackers to you no no no but you know

526
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,260
to hackers to you no no no but you know
 

527
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,530
to hackers to you no no no but you know
so think about your ISP modem could be

528
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:06,540
so think about your ISP modem could be
 

529
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,470
so think about your ISP modem could be
port 1444 or something right and then

530
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:09,480
port 1444 or something right and then
 

531
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,840
port 1444 or something right and then
that points to the IP address of the

532
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:11,850
that points to the IP address of the
 

533
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,829
that points to the IP address of the
neck years land port which apparently

534
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:14,839
neck years land port which apparently
 

535
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,970
neck years land port which apparently
apparently the only way that I could

536
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:16,980
apparently the only way that I could
 

537
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,290
apparently the only way that I could
make it work with redirects

538
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:18,300
make it work with redirects
 

539
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,000
make it work with redirects
Bo's port 22 on the EMG u-verse modem

540
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,010
Bo's port 22 on the EMG u-verse modem
 

541
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,150
Bo's port 22 on the EMG u-verse modem
yeah on the user DMZ it yeah

542
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
yeah on the user DMZ it yeah
 

543
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,250
yeah on the user DMZ it yeah
which are down to avoid death I'm trying

544
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,260
which are down to avoid death I'm trying
 

545
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,780
which are down to avoid death I'm trying
to avoid that yeah so this thing I have

546
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:32,790
to avoid that yeah so this thing I have
 

547
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,750
to avoid that yeah so this thing I have
the same issue he blocks it to that's

548
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
the same issue he blocks it to that's
 

549
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,730
the same issue he blocks it to that's
why Robbie sometimes you talk to you

550

I'm thinking a bridge in mine and and
 

563
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,120
I'm thinking a bridge in mine and and
building a PF sense

564
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,130
building a PF sense
 

565
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,330
building a PF sense
yeah system to control everything

566
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:56,340
yeah system to control everything
 

567
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,530

oh yeah he did that at times house he

568
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
oh yeah he did that at times house he
 

569
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,590
oh yeah he did that at times house he
has a server there and they lost the I

570

has a server there and they lost the I
 

571
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,990
has a server there and they lost the I
had to replace the modem but they won't

572
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,000
had to replace the modem but they won't
 

573
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,140
had to replace the modem but they won't
he used to have for many years he had in

574
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,150
he used to have for many years he had in
 

575
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,830
he used to have for many years he had in
there bridge mode and before he reached

576
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:15,840
there bridge mode and before he reached
 

577
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,880
there bridge mode and before he reached
it he configured the modem so yeah setup

578
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:19,890
it he configured the modem so yeah setup
 

579
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,360
it he configured the modem so yeah setup
button

580

581
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:33,710

there's nothing just have it trigger

582
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:33,720
there's nothing just have it trigger
 

583
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,050
there's nothing just have it trigger
like an AI voice that says don't touch

584
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,060
like an AI voice that says don't touch
 

585
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:43,100
like an AI voice that says don't touch
that so my specific question to you

586
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,110
that so my specific question to you
 

587
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,260
that so my specific question to you
Robbie before we had to cut it short

588
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,270
Robbie before we had to cut it short
 

589
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,010
Robbie before we had to cut it short
again yesterday was what what do you

590
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,020
again yesterday was what what do you
 

591
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:54,140
again yesterday was what what do you
look for in a router router that you

592
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,150
look for in a router router that you
 

593
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,300
look for in a router router that you
would plug internal you know that that

594
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,310
would plug internal you know that that
 

595
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,010
would plug internal you know that that
would be the only thing that connects

596
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,020
would be the only thing that connects
 

597
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,790
would be the only thing that connects
from your u-verse or your cable modem or

598
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:01,800
from your u-verse or your cable modem or
 

599
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,400
from your u-verse or your cable modem or
whatever it is you're using assuming you

600
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,410
whatever it is you're using assuming you
 

601
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,950
whatever it is you're using assuming you
bridge that modem that means that the

602
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:08,960
bridge that modem that means that the
 

603
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,200
bridge that modem that means that the
router that you've connected is your

604
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,210
router that you've connected is your
 

605
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,800
router that you've connected is your
primary line of defense right now I know

606
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:15,810
primary line of defense right now I know
 

607
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,200
primary line of defense right now I know
you're gonna say mikrotik and I did that

608
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,210
you're gonna say mikrotik and I did that
 

609
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,580
you're gonna say mikrotik and I did that
I'm okay with that

610
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:19,590
I'm okay with that
 

611
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,830
I'm okay with that
well that's a brand but I know it's

612
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:21,840
well that's a brand but I know it's
 

613
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,890
well that's a brand but I know it's
still asking I'm still asking what do

614
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:24,900
still asking I'm still asking what do
 

615
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,780
still asking I'm still asking what do
you look for in a router yeah that that

616
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:29,790
you look for in a router yeah that that
 

617
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,550
you look for in a router yeah that that
makes you feel comfortable

618
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,560
makes you feel comfortable
 

619
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,090
makes you feel comfortable
that he will act it will properly

620
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,100
that he will act it will properly
 

621
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,019
that he will act it will properly
protect you

622
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:36,029
protect you
 

623
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,870
protect you
yeah and in there so so first of all

624
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
yeah and in there so so first of all
 

625
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,300
yeah and in there so so first of all
like when I say mikrotik isn't Rand yeah

626
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,310
like when I say mikrotik isn't Rand yeah
 

627
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,480
like when I say mikrotik isn't Rand yeah
mikrotik is a brand right so true when I

628
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,490
mikrotik is a brand right so true when I
 

629
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,019
mikrotik is a brand right so true when I
say oh go buy a mikrotik that's because

630
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:47,029
say oh go buy a mikrotik that's because
 

631
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,610
say oh go buy a mikrotik that's because
I've already used a whole bunch of

632
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:49,620
I've already used a whole bunch of
 

633
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,190
I've already used a whole bunch of
different brands and have said okay this

634
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,200
different brands and have said okay this
 

635
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,230
different brands and have said okay this
is this one has everything I need for

636
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
is this one has everything I need for
 

637
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,790
is this one has everything I need for
much much cheaper so so so I have to be

638
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
much much cheaper so so so I have to be
 

639
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,280
much much cheaper so so so I have to be
more careful with that because no I'm

640
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,290
more careful with that because no I'm
 

641
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,579
more careful with that because no I'm
saying the these are the features and I

642
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:04,589
saying the these are the features and I
 

643
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,960
saying the these are the features and I
think this is your question is what are

644
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:05,970
think this is your question is what are
 

645
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,670
think this is your question is what are
the distributors that I look for so why

646
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
the distributors that I look for so why
 

647
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,390
the distributors that I look for so why
why did I inevitably settle on Microtech

648
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,400
why did I inevitably settle on Microtech
 

649
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,090
why did I inevitably settle on Microtech
price is a big part or any brand or any

650
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,100
price is a big part or any brand or any
 

651
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,570
price is a big part or any brand or any
item so it can be any brand so yeah so

652
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:17,580
item so it can be any brand so yeah so
 

653
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,660
item so it can be any brand so yeah so
two things I think are key for me one is

654
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:20,670
two things I think are key for me one is
 

655
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,790
two things I think are key for me one is
I want it to have the capability of

656
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
I want it to have the capability of
 

657
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,480
I want it to have the capability of
controlling how it caches things so as

658
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,490
controlling how it caches things so as
 

659
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,030
controlling how it caches things so as
as an attack is happening for example I

660
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
as an attack is happening for example I
 

661
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,220
as an attack is happening for example I
want to be able to control the

662
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,230
want to be able to control the
 

663
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,710
want to be able to control the
responsiveness of my router so if if I

664
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
responsiveness of my router so if if I
 

665
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,020
responsiveness of my router so if if I
come under a DDoS attack I want to be

666
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,030
come under a DDoS attack I want to be
 

667
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,640
come under a DDoS attack I want to be
able to shut down that DDoS attack

668
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:46,650
able to shut down that DDoS attack
 

669
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,579
able to shut down that DDoS attack
without affecting my main services and

670
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:49,589
without affecting my main services and
 

671
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:51,320
without affecting my main services and
so that's important to me mikrotik does

672
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,330
so that's important to me mikrotik does
 

673
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,079
so that's important to me mikrotik does
that really really well and it allows it

674
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,089
that really really well and it allows it
 

675
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,050
that really really well and it allows it
to kind of reroute traffic based on for

676
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,060
to kind of reroute traffic based on for
 

677
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,100
to kind of reroute traffic based on for
example if if I have said my computer's

678
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,110
example if if I have said my computer's
 

679
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,640
example if if I have said my computer's
MAC address is this then the mikrotik

680
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:04,650
MAC address is this then the mikrotik
 

681
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,340
MAC address is this then the mikrotik
automatically skips over some of the

682
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,350
automatically skips over some of the
 

683
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,250
automatically skips over some of the
checks for that MAC address so it makes

684
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,260
checks for that MAC address so it makes
 

685
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
checks for that MAC address so it makes
it a lot faster right mm-hmm

686
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,270
it a lot faster right mm-hmm
 

687
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,460
it a lot faster right mm-hmm
so so that's important to me the second

688
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:16,470
so so that's important to me the second
 

689
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:23,000
so so that's important to me the second
thing is I like my routers to have the

690
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,010
thing is I like my routers to have the
 

691
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,870
thing is I like my routers to have the
same mentality that I have which is lock

692
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
same mentality that I have which is lock
 

693
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,790
same mentality that I have which is lock
down everything unless I say otherwise

694
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:28,800
down everything unless I say otherwise
 

695
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,390
down everything unless I say otherwise
right yeah right Ron by default

696
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
right yeah right Ron by default
 

697
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,640
right yeah right Ron by default
everything should be locked down my

698
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:34,650
everything should be locked down my
 

699
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,130
everything should be locked down my
router should be about security so I

700
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,140
router should be about security so I
 

701
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,870
router should be about security so I
shouldn't have to look at it and say oh

702
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
shouldn't have to look at it and say oh
 

703
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,090
shouldn't have to look at it and say oh
that's open I need to close that that's

704
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,100
that's open I need to close that that's
 

705
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,090
that's open I need to close that that's
the mentality of the ISP let that select

706
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,100
the mentality of the ISP let that select
 

707
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,039
the mentality of the ISP let that select
universal plug and play

708
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:46,049
universal plug and play
 

709
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:48,560
universal plug and play
yeah yeah exactly I wanted I've heard a

710
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,570
yeah yeah exactly I wanted I've heard a
 

711
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,560
yeah yeah exactly I wanted I've heard a
magnet I did not know that my old router

712
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:51,570
magnet I did not know that my old router
 

713
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,229
magnet I did not know that my old router
had UPnP enabled for so long before

714
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:54,239
had UPnP enabled for so long before
 

715
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,350
had UPnP enabled for so long before
before I just happened to run across a

716
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
before I just happened to run across a
 

717
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,570
before I just happened to run across a
net cast somewhere you should turn off

718
00:17:59,570 --> 00:17:59,580
net cast somewhere you should turn off
 

719
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,029
net cast somewhere you should turn off
UPnP and here's why all of the printers

720
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
UPnP and here's why all of the printers
 

721
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,979
UPnP and here's why all of the printers
that the Canadian hacker printed - it's

722
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:06,989
that the Canadian hacker printed - it's
 

723
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:12,739
that the Canadian hacker printed - it's
because of UPnP Oh like a half a million

724
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:12,749
because of UPnP Oh like a half a million
 

725
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:15,619
because of UPnP Oh like a half a million
printers so yeah I mean it's got to be

726
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:15,629
printers so yeah I mean it's got to be
 

727
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:20,149
printers so yeah I mean it's got to be
locked down completely securely unless I

728
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:20,159
locked down completely securely unless I
 

729
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,489
locked down completely securely unless I
say I want to open that and when I open

730
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:22,499
say I want to open that and when I open
 

731
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,739
say I want to open that and when I open
that I don't want just rudimentary it's

732
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:24,749
that I don't want just rudimentary it's
 

733
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,109
that I don't want just rudimentary it's
on or off like DMZ I wanted to be able

734
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:27,119
on or off like DMZ I wanted to be able
 

735
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,619
on or off like DMZ I wanted to be able
to control the traffic so so and that's

736
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:30,629
to control the traffic so so and that's
 

737
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:31,999
to control the traffic so so and that's
part of it so maybe that's three things

738
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:32,009
part of it so maybe that's three things
 

739
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,680
part of it so maybe that's three things
but I think that's still part of the the

740
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:33,690
but I think that's still part of the the
 

741
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,409
but I think that's still part of the the
routing aspect in that I don't want to

742
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:36,419
routing aspect in that I don't want to
 

743
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,159
routing aspect in that I don't want to
just say yes I'm going to allow SSH

744
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:39,169
just say yes I'm going to allow SSH
 

745
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,989
just say yes I'm going to allow SSH
which is that that's what you do with

746
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:41,999
which is that that's what you do with
 

747
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:45,560
which is that that's what you do with
the neck here I want to say I will allow

748
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:45,570
the neck here I want to say I will allow
 

749
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,470
the neck here I want to say I will allow
SSH to this IP address because this is

750
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
SSH to this IP address because this is
 

751
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,940
SSH to this IP address because this is
my home computer I will allow it only

752
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:52,950
my home computer I will allow it only
 

753
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,119
my home computer I will allow it only
with this SSL cert I will allow it only

754
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,129
with this SSL cert I will allow it only
 

755
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:58,419
with this SSL cert I will allow it only
from the country of Canada and

756
00:18:58,419 --> 00:18:58,429
from the country of Canada and
 

757
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,680
from the country of Canada and
everything else I want it to go through

758
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,690
everything else I want it to go through
 

759
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,940
everything else I want it to go through
these filters before it's allowed or so

760
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:03,950
these filters before it's allowed or so
 

761
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,720
these filters before it's allowed or so
to be clear the Netgear router and in

762
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,730
to be clear the Netgear router and in
 

763
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,989
to be clear the Netgear router and in
fact the one I had prior to - this one

764
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:11,999
fact the one I had prior to - this one
 

765
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,960
fact the one I had prior to - this one
is quite happy to accept and port

766
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:14,970
is quite happy to accept and port
 

767
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,379
is quite happy to accept and port
forward SSH on a custom port it does not

768
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:18,389
forward SSH on a custom port it does not
 

769
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,690
forward SSH on a custom port it does not
have to be plus when you - I think they

770
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:20,700
have to be plus when you - I think they
 

771
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,960
have to be plus when you - I think they
they always lose just that's true now

772
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:23,970
they always lose just that's true now
 

773
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,180
they always lose just that's true now
what I have not heard about and this was

774
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,190
what I have not heard about and this was
 

775
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,609
what I have not heard about and this was
what surprised me yesterday was when you

776
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:28,619
what surprised me yesterday was when you
 

777
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,849
what surprised me yesterday was when you
described how you needed how you could

778
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:31,859
described how you needed how you could
 

779
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:34,599
described how you needed how you could
configure it so that you needed an SSH

780
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:34,609
configure it so that you needed an SSH
 

781
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:39,019
configure it so that you needed an SSH
cert or an SSL cert to even be able to

782
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:39,029
cert or an SSL cert to even be able to
 

783
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:41,570
cert or an SSL cert to even be able to
negotiate that connection to even be

784
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:41,580
negotiate that connection to even be
 

785
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,789
negotiate that connection to even be
able to open that connection from

786
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:43,799
able to open that connection from
 

787
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,460
able to open that connection from
outside that's something I'd never heard

788
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:46,470
outside that's something I'd never heard
 

789
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,320
outside that's something I'd never heard
of before gets really sophisticated it

790
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,330
of before gets really sophisticated it
 

791
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,690
of before gets really sophisticated it
sounded a lot like an airport knocking

792
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:53,700
sounded a lot like an airport knocking
 

793
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,349
sounded a lot like an airport knocking
on there I don't think that yeah what

794
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:57,359
on there I don't think that yeah what
 

795
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,210
on there I don't think that yeah what
you're having

796
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,220
you're having
 

797
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,399
you're having
say again so be explained to me what it

798
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:02,409
say again so be explained to me what it
 

799
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:11,690
say again so be explained to me what it
is you know he had something that you

800
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:11,700
is you know he had something that you
 

801
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,339
is you know he had something that you
you had to be authorized in order to

802
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:14,349
you had to be authorized in order to
 

803
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:16,759
you had to be authorized in order to
initiate the collection it sounded like

804
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:16,769
initiate the collection it sounded like
 

805
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,799
initiate the collection it sounded like
an old-fashioned and important Hocking

806
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:19,809
an old-fashioned and important Hocking
 

807
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,200
an old-fashioned and important Hocking
but but I'm not sure if that is what he

808
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,210
but but I'm not sure if that is what he
 

809
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,580
but but I'm not sure if that is what he
was talking about

810
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:23,590
was talking about
 

811
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:29,700
was talking about
you should pork knocking yes I've never

812
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:29,710
you should pork knocking yes I've never
 

813
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,200
you should pork knocking yes I've never
heard it either I don't know what that

814
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,210
heard it either I don't know what that
 

815
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,649
heard it either I don't know what that
means

816
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:31,659
means
 

817
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,690
means
yeah the port knocking he said you are

818
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:33,700
yeah the port knocking he said you are
 

819
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,229
yeah the port knocking he said you are
pinging air you use some scripts to do

820
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:37,239
pinging air you use some scripts to do
 

821
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,389
pinging air you use some scripts to do
that it's automated but you're pinging

822
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:39,399
that it's automated but you're pinging
 

823
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,729
that it's automated but you're pinging
are up specific coach and then then

00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:41,739
are up specific coach and then then
 

825
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,339
are up specific coach and then then
maybe you're peeing a specific sequence

826
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:44,349
maybe you're peeing a specific sequence
 

827
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:47,639
maybe you're peeing a specific sequence
of port in order for portrait to do is

00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:47,649
of port in order for portrait to do is

what a hacker would do to try and figure

832
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:50,830
what a hacker would do to try and figure
 

833
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,529
what a hacker would do to try and figure
out if there's anything open on those

834
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:52,539
out if there's anything open on those
 

835
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,649
out if there's anything open on those
ports right no a map or talking he said

836
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:55,659
ports right no a map or talking he said

configuring what that sequence is you

840
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:00,609
configuring what that sequence is you
 

841
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:06,719
configuring what that sequence is you
are pinging port 10,000 and maybe 6400

842
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:06,729
are pinging port 10,000 and maybe 6400
 

843
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:11,310
are pinging port 10,000 and maybe 6400
you have a series of approach two or

844
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,320
you have a series of approach two or
 

845
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,219
you have a series of approach two or
three and and when you do that in in in

00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:14,229
three and and when you do that in in in
 

847
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,299
three and and when you do that in in in
a certain order

848
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:15,309
a certain order
 

849
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:18,080
a certain order
then port strategy is opening for you

850
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,090
then port strategy is opening for you
 

851
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,549
then port strategy is opening for you
that is why having never heard of that

852
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
that is why having never heard of that
 

853
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,930
that is why having never heard of that
I've never heard of that that is what I

854
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:27,940
I've never heard of that that is what I
 

855
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,489
I've never heard of that that is what I
had what came to me I don't think that

856
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:32,499
had what came to me I don't think that
 

857
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:36,479
had what came to me I don't think that
is what know from know from what Robby

858
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:36,489
is what know from know from what Robby
 

859
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,249
is what know from know from what Robby
described and I'm sorry Robbie I don't

860
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:38,259
described and I'm sorry Robbie I don't
 

861
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,109
described and I'm sorry Robbie I don't
mean to talk about you like you're not

862
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:40,119
mean to talk about you like you're not
 

863
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,200
mean to talk about you like you're not
here but I kind of like it

864
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,210
here but I kind of like it
 

865
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,060
here but I kind of like it
I'm just but I'm almost out of coffee

866
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,070

 

867
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,669

yes from what you described Robbie it

868
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:50,679
yes from what you described Robbie it
 

869
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,229
yes from what you described Robbie it
doesn't sound like that's what it is it

870
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:52,239
doesn't sound like that's what it is it
 

871
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,509
doesn't sound like that's what it is it
sounds like you specifically need a

00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:54,519
sounds like you specifically need a
 

873
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,830
sounds like you specifically need a

00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
separate I'll call it an SSH you know
 

875
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,909

00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:02,919
search info order to exit or SSL so in
 

877
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,729

remember how we did it cuz cuz it it's

886
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
remember how we did it cuz cuz it it's
 

887
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,290
remember how we did it cuz cuz it it's
rather sophisticated what what we did is

888
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:17,300
rather sophisticated what what we did is
 

889
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,500
rather sophisticated what what we did is
we created a virtual appliance on one of

890
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:20,510
we created a virtual appliance on one of
 

891
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,870
we created a virtual appliance on one of
the hypervisors that generated SSL keys

892
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
the hypervisors that generated SSL keys
 

893
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,220
the hypervisors that generated SSL keys
and then had the traffic routed from the

894
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,230
and then had the traffic routed from the
 

895
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,500
and then had the traffic routed from the
mikrotik for the ssh to check and verify

896
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,510
mikrotik for the ssh to check and verify
 

897
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,290
mikrotik for the ssh to check and verify
the SSL certificate before it allowed

the SSL certificate before it allowed
the routing of the traffic to no ssh it

900
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:39,530
the routing of the traffic to no ssh it
 

901
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,170
the routing of the traffic to no ssh it
was really sophisticated and this is

902
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:41,180
was really sophisticated and this is
 

903
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,240
was really sophisticated and this is
because because well the boss was

904
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,250
because because well the boss was
 

905
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,560
because because well the boss was
travelling and he didn't want other

906
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:47,570
travelling and he didn't want other
 

907
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,010
travelling and he didn't want other
people being able to access ssh how

908
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,020
people being able to access ssh how
 

909
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,500
people being able to access ssh how
often has it gone wrong

910
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,510
often has it gone wrong
 

911
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,210
often has it gone wrong
never okay flawlessly yeah okay but it

912
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:58,220
never okay flawlessly yeah okay but it
 

913
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,150
never okay flawlessly yeah okay but it
but we don't again I subscribe to the

914
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,160
but we don't again I subscribe to the
 

915
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,940
but we don't again I subscribe to the
mindset of block everything unless I

916
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:03,950
mindset of block everything unless I
 

917
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,040
mindset of block everything unless I
approve it so with this with this

918
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,050
approve it so with this with this
 

919
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,740
approve it so with this with this
capability or this setup we were able to

920
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:08,750
capability or this setup we were able to
 

921
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,210
capability or this setup we were able to
open it up to him but no matter where in

922
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,220
open it up to him but no matter where in
 

923
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,730
open it up to him but no matter where in
the world he is but yet still block it

924
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:15,740
the world he is but yet still block it
 

925
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,500
the world he is but yet still block it
from any geographic region that we

926
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:17,510
from any geographic region that we
 

927
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,780
from any geographic region that we
didn't approve except if it was him that

928
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:19,790
didn't approve except if it was him that
 

929
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,290
didn't approve except if it was him that
was there yeah ya know so again by

930
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,300
was there yeah ya know so again by
 

931
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,020
was there yeah ya know so again by
authorizing it then we then skip these

932
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,030
authorizing it then we then skip these
 

933
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,390
authorizing it then we then skip these
other rules in the mikrotik router or in

934
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
other rules in the mikrotik router or in
 

935
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,510
other rules in the mikrotik router or in
the firewall so it's really cool I mean

936
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
the firewall so it's really cool I mean
 

937
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,190
the firewall so it's really cool I mean
there's there's this it's one of those

938
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,200
there's there's this it's one of those
 

939
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,300
there's there's this it's one of those
things like I couldn't tell you how I

940
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,310
things like I couldn't tell you how I
 

941
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,050
things like I couldn't tell you how I
did that

942
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,060
did that
 

943
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,520
did that
like just off the top of my head I'd

944
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:36,530
like just off the top of my head I'd
 

945
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,880
like just off the top of my head I'd
have to look back at notes but but but I

946
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:39,890
have to look back at notes but but but I
 

947
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,990
have to look back at notes but but but I
can tell you anything that I've ever

948
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,000
can tell you anything that I've ever
 

949
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,050
can tell you anything that I've ever
needed to do we've just been able to do

950
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,060
needed to do we've just been able to do
 

951
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,690
needed to do we've just been able to do
it like just and if I were quarterly on

952
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:46,700
it like just and if I were quarterly on
 

953
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,330
it like just and if I were quarterly on
that so I got around that by picking a

954
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:49,340
that so I got around that by picking a
 

955
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,730
that so I got around that by picking a
port number that was way up high in the

956
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:51,740
port number that was way up high in the
 

957
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,830
port number that was way up high in the
address budget yeah you can do that but

958
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
address budget yeah you can do that but
 

959
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,340
address budget yeah you can do that but
ports can still happen for the whole 64

960
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,350
ports can still happen for the whole 64
 

961
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,330
ports can still happen for the whole 64
thousand porch yeah yeah and when they

962
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:01,340
thousand porch yeah yeah and when they
 

963
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,790
thousand porch yeah yeah and when they
do happen my mikrotik will say all right

964
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:03,800
do happen my mikrotik will say all right
 

965
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,860
do happen my mikrotik will say all right
you've ports Kandice five times blocked

966
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:05,870
you've ports Kandice five times blocked
 

967
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,980
you've ports Kandice five times blocked
you're done yeah yeah so by the time

968
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:08,990
you're done yeah yeah so by the time
 

969
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:20,430
you're done yeah yeah so by the time
they get to port five they usually do

970
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:20,440
they get to port five they usually do
 

971
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,910
they get to port five they usually do
this kind of security that Robbie has it

972
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:24,920
this kind of security that Robbie has it
 

973
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,919
this kind of security that Robbie has it
is too

974
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:25,929
is too
 

975
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:31,019

and that's what I do
 

983
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,810
and that's what I do
anyway right yeah man that was the very

00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:40,820
anyway right yeah man that was the very
 

985
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,699
anyway right yeah man that was the very
first thing I setup before I even moved

00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:53,499
that is working disabled as I said
 

991
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:58,060
that is working disabled as I said
disabled posture I've done that too I've

992
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,070
disabled posture I've done that too I've
 

993
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,190
disabled posture I've done that too I've
done that as well I mean I've had it

994
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,200
done that as well I mean I've had it
 

995
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,519
done that as well I mean I've had it
happen before where I've changed the key

996
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:03,529
happen before where I've changed the key
 

997
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:05,440
happen before where I've changed the key
but forgot to change you know I've

998
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,450
but forgot to change you know I've
 

999
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,199
but forgot to change you know I've
changed that the public key on the

1000
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:08,209
changed that the public key on the
 

1001
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:10,389
changed that the public key on the
server but forgot to change the private

whatever sequence and it you know it
says yep you can't fail then you don't

1008
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:18,259
says yep you can't fail then you don't
 

1009

have any other ways to to authenticate

1010
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,450
have any other ways to to authenticate
 

1011
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,989
have any other ways to to authenticate
so you're not getting me yeah the other

1012
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:22,999
so you're not getting me yeah the other
 

1013
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,909
so you're not getting me yeah the other
thing I like to do like to supplement my

1014
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:24,919
thing I like to do like to supplement my
 

1015
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,279
thing I like to do like to supplement my
SSH protection is just have a single

1016
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:27,289
SSH protection is just have a single
 

1017
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:30,099
SSH protection is just have a single
unit which is quite often an order ID

1018
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:30,109
unit which is quite often an order ID
 

1019
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:33,009
unit which is quite often an order ID
xu4 or some other SBC but just a single

1020
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:33,019
xu4 or some other SBC but just a single
 

1021
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,079
xu4 or some other SBC but just a single
unit that's allowed to receive SSH

1022
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,089
unit that's allowed to receive SSH
 

1023
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:37,930
unit that's allowed to receive SSH
connections and then that unit has land

1024
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:37,940
connections and then that unit has land
 

1025
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,119
connections and then that unit has land
access to other resources on my land

1026
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,129
access to other resources on my land
 

1027
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:42,699
access to other resources on my land
so because sometimes people will open

1028
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:42,709
so because sometimes people will open
 

1029
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,129
so because sometimes people will open
you know I'll have ten ten ports open in

1030
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:45,139
you know I'll have ten ten ports open in
 

1031
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:47,199
you know I'll have ten ten ports open in
my firewall so that I can SSH to this

1032
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:47,209
my firewall so that I can SSH to this
 

1033
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:49,029
my firewall so that I can SSH to this
computer and SSH to that computer and

1034
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:49,039
computer and SSH to that computer and
 

1035
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,819
computer and SSH to that computer and
not compute and then you get Lacs on

1036
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:51,829
not compute and then you get Lacs on
 

1037
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:53,589
not compute and then you get Lacs on
your security on one of those commuters

1038
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:53,599
your security on one of those commuters
 

1039
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,940
your security on one of those commuters
and boom that's an entry point for

1040
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:54,950
and boom that's an entry point for
 

1041
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,629
and boom that's an entry point for
ransomware so instead I have just one

1042
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:58,639
ransomware so instead I have just one
 

1043
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:01,239

I'll use a reverse socks proxy to coup

1046
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,070
I'll use a reverse socks proxy to coup
 

1047
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,819
I'll use a reverse socks proxy to coup
SSH to that and then access my network

1048
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:06,829
SSH to that and then access my network
 

1049
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:07,479
SSH to that and then access my network
resources

1050

now when you say do Droid has access

1052
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:09,919
now when you say do Droid has access
 

1053
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,039
now when you say do Droid has access
that sounds like Peters gotten on the

that sounds like Peters gotten on the
 

1055
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:17,680
that sounds like Peters gotten on the

has access to the to the network

1058
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:21,649
has access to the to the network
 

1059
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:23,979

absolutely but but because I only have

1074
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:45,560
absolutely but but because I only have

that one device I can harden that device

1076
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,400
that one device I can harden that device
 

1077
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,730
that one device I can harden that device
very securely and I can stay on top of

1078
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:51,740
very securely and I can stay on top of
 

1079
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,670
very securely and I can stay on top of
keeping that device harden versus having

1080
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:54,680
keeping that device harden versus having
 

1081
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
keeping that device harden versus having
to harden every device on my network

1082
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:56,690
to harden every device on my network
 

1083

main reason it's in the bridge is
 

1119
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,540
main reason it's in the bridge is
because I want my server to have the

hardening on that yeah that's cool so so

1124
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:12,980
hardening on that yeah that's cool so so
 

1125
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,190
hardening on that yeah that's cool so so

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,090
question like you know how did I settle
 

1129
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,750
question like you know how did I settle
on mikrotik I used to use mono I used to

1130
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
on mikrotik I used to use mono I used to
 

1131

use mono wall and pfsense in a very
 

1133
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,700
use mono wall and pfsense in a very
similar scenario as you with a PC with

1134
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:24,710
similar scenario as you with a PC with
 

1135
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,740
similar scenario as you with a PC with
multi NIC and then when you when you

1136
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:29,750
multi NIC and then when you when you
 

1137
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,960

1138
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:31,970
realize that something like a micro tech
 

1139
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:42,220
realize that something like a micro tech
can use a tenth of the power so it's

1140
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,230
can use a tenth of the power so it's
 

1141
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,030
can use a tenth of the power so it's
multitasking I wouldn't do that I

1142
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,040
multitasking I wouldn't do that I
 

1143
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,740
multitasking I wouldn't do that I
wouldn't do I would always separate

I might do during the summer when I get
 

1151
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,139
I might do during the summer when I get
a few more drives in it might you start

1152
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:02,149
a few more drives in it might you start
 

1153
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,739
a few more drives in it might you start
a steaming server for things yeah that's

1154

a steaming server for things yeah that's
 

1155
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:08,680
a steaming server for things yeah that's
cool but my Raptor server is it's not

1156
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:08,690
cool but my Raptor server is it's not

yeah yeah that's another way to do it I

1178
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:37,179
yeah yeah that's another way to do it I
 

1179
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:39,759
yeah yeah that's another way to do it I
am like I don't know if it's because you

I do I do get concerned about is once
 

1195
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:58,509
I do I do get concerned about is once
you once you can SSH into the main

1196
00:29:58,509 --> 00:29:58,519
you once you can SSH into the main
 

1197
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,830
you once you can SSH into the main
machine now you've got access to

1198
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
machine now you've got access to
 

1199
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,930
machine now you've got access to
everything and that does bother me

1200
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:01,940
everything and that does bother me
 

1201
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,779
everything and that does bother me
know once you act once you've SSH into

1202
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:04,789
know once you act once you've SSH into
 

1203
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:07,930
know once you act once you've SSH into
the main machine presumably the xu4 in

1204
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:07,940
the main machine presumably the xu4 in
 

1205
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,899
the main machine presumably the xu4 in
my case now you have to authenticate to

1206
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:10,909
my case now you have to authenticate to
 

1207
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,940
my case now you have to authenticate to
get access to the network resources

1208
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:12,950
get access to the network resources
 

1209
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,940
get access to the network resources
right in that machine you can't do it as

1210
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:15,950
right in that machine you can't do it as
 

1211
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,099
right in that machine you can't do it as
the user who accesses it which is a

1212
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:18,109
the user who accesses it which is a
 

1213
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,529
the user who accesses it which is a
low-level user yeah no you can't access

1214
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:20,539
low-level user yeah no you can't access
 

1215
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:22,869
low-level user yeah no you can't access
anything with that access now you have

1216
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:22,879
anything with that access now you have
 

1217
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:25,269
anything with that access now you have
to elevate your user access to a user

1218
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
to elevate your user access to a user
 

1219
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,419
to elevate your user access to a user
account on the system that has access to

1220
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:28,429
account on the system that has access to
 

1221
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,840
account on the system that has access to
those resources that user account is not

1222
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:31,850
those resources that user account is not
 

1223
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,419
those resources that user account is not
allowed to connect to SSH or we have to

1224
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:34,429
allowed to connect to SSH or we have to
 

1225
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:45,639
allowed to connect to SSH or we have to
connect first then elevate like it I

1226
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:45,649
connect first then elevate like it I
 

1227
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:48,299
connect first then elevate like it I
like it but as with all homegrown

1228
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:48,309
like it but as with all homegrown
 

1229
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,450
like it but as with all homegrown
security type you know solutions the

1230
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:52,460
security type you know solutions the
 

1231
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,580
security type you know solutions the
more you know the more security is but

1232
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:54,590
more you know the more security is but
 

1233
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,539
more you know the more security is but
the more you have to do to get you know

1234
00:30:58,539 --> 00:30:58,549
the more you have to do to get you know
 

1235
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:01,720
the more you have to do to get you know
normal access to your to you I'm fine

1236
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:01,730
normal access to your to you I'm fine
 

1237
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,950
normal access to your to you I'm fine
with that
