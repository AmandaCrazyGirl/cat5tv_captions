[Laughter]
I've got a micro tick on Amazon here for

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,010
I've got a micro tick on Amazon here for
 

155
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,300
I've got a micro tick on Amazon here for
$107 yeah I'm gonna be showing them on

156
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,310
$107 yeah I'm gonna be showing them on
 

157
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,760
$107 yeah I'm gonna be showing them on
the show lands man and one of the things

158
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,770
the show lands man and one of the things
 

159
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,170
the show lands man and one of the things
is that they have like a hundred

160
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,180
is that they have like a hundred
 

161
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,020
is that they have like a hundred
different models and you just do

162
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,030
different models and you just do
 

163
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,000
different models and you just do
traditionally routers you have to pay

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,010
traditionally routers you have to pay
 

165
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,399
traditionally routers you have to pay
more for extra features in the software

166
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:36,409
more for extra features in the software
 

167
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,290
more for extra features in the software
these ones they take a different

168
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:38,300
these ones they take a different
 

169
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,029
these ones they take a different
approach the software is unlocked and

170
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:40,039
approach the software is unlocked and
 

171
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,070
approach the software is unlocked and
you buy the hardware based on what your

172
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
you buy the hardware based on what your
 

173
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,159
you buy the hardware based on what your
needs are so for example the one I got

174
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,169
needs are so for example the one I got
 

175
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,540
needs are so for example the one I got
the advantage to it is well it has what

176
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,550
the advantage to it is well it has what
 

177
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,000
the advantage to it is well it has what
do they call these things a particular

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,010
do they call these things a particular
 

179
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,529
do they call these things a particular
type of port for the fiber bug snc or

180
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:56,539
type of port for the fiber bug snc or
 

181
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,649
type of port for the fiber bug snc or
knowing what is that I don't know I'm

182
00:05:59,649 --> 00:05:59,659
knowing what is that I don't know I'm
 

183
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,020
knowing what is that I don't know I'm
never gonna use that but that's one of

184
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,030
never gonna use that but that's one of
 

185
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,399
never gonna use that but that's one of
the advantages to this one if you needed

186
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,409
the advantages to this one if you needed
 

187
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,870
the advantages to this one if you needed
that I can't remember what they're

188
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
that I can't remember what they're
 

189
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,180
that I can't remember what they're
called for some reason yeah that's for

190
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,190
called for some reason yeah that's for
 

191
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,000
called for some reason yeah that's for
what oh you can put a fiber module in

192
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,010
what oh you can put a fiber module in
 

193
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,820
what oh you can put a fiber module in
there so that you can uplink it to other

194
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:12,830
there so that you can uplink it to other
 

195
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,969
there so that you can uplink it to other
devices at big speeds

196
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:15,979
devices at big speeds
 

197
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,940
devices at big speeds
maybe for storage or some yi1 of this

198
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:18,950
maybe for storage or some yi1 of this
 

199
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,490
maybe for storage or some yi1 of this

I have plans after this reshuffle there

264
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:04,969
I have plans after this reshuffle there
 

265
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,629
I have plans after this reshuffle there
are modules in there my main desktop PC

266
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:07,639
are modules in there my main desktop PC
 

267
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,830
are modules in there my main desktop PC
and my server my main desktop need eight

268
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
and my server my main desktop need eight
 

269
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,180
and my server my main desktop need eight
now has 16 gigs of RAM and it can and

270
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,190
now has 16 gigs of RAM and it can and
 

271
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,320
now has 16 gigs of RAM and it can and
the server has 64 so if I change there

272
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,330
the server has 64 so if I change there
 

273
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,939
the server has 64 so if I change there
are modules in my main desktop for they

274
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:29,949

 

275
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:40,360

and my server will still have 48 32 and

276
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,370
and my server will still have 48 32 and
 

277
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,540
and my server will still have 48 32 and
you sure the server doesn't have ECC

278
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:42,550
you sure the server doesn't have ECC
 

279
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:55,200
you sure the server doesn't have ECC
I would guess I would yeah yeah just do

280
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,210
I would guess I would yeah yeah just do
 

281
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,670
I would guess I would yeah yeah just do
a quick search for the model a server

282
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:56,680
a quick search for the model a server
 

283
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,570
a quick search for the model a server
just make sure that it that it's non-ecc

284
00:08:59,570 --> 00:08:59,580
just make sure that it that it's non-ecc
 

285
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,930
just make sure that it that it's non-ecc
otherwise it won't be compatible cuz sir

286
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:03,940
otherwise it won't be compatible cuz sir
 

287
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,360
otherwise it won't be compatible cuz sir
like I I don't remember what the server

288
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,370
like I I don't remember what the server
 

289
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:12,870
like I I don't remember what the server
was is it a dollar it's only its HP okay

290
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
was is it a dollar it's only its HP okay
 

291
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,990
was is it a dollar it's only its HP okay
yeah so it might be ECC I think I can

292
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,000
yeah so it might be ECC I think I can
 

293
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,540
yeah so it might be ECC I think I can
and plug well and I'll show you if you

294
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,550
and plug well and I'll show you if you
 

295
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,560
and plug well and I'll show you if you
can tell by looking at it I've just look

296
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:25,570
can tell by looking at it I've just look
 

297
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,030
can tell by looking at it I've just look
up the model yeah again I don't have a

298
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,040
up the model yeah again I don't have a
 

299
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,770
up the model yeah again I don't have a
computer to look at stuff but yeah I

300
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:31,780
computer to look at stuff but yeah I
 

301
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,830
computer to look at stuff but yeah I
should say ECC on the module or not yeah

302
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:36,840
should say ECC on the module or not yeah
 

303
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,460
should say ECC on the module or not yeah
yeah that's the thing so but you can

304
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,470
yeah that's the thing so but you can
 

305
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,710
yeah that's the thing so but you can
look up the the model of the server and

306
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:43,720
look up the the model of the server and
 

307
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,900
look up the the model of the server and
it'll probably tell you he can't hear us

308
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:45,910
it'll probably tell you he can't hear us
 

309
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,940
it'll probably tell you he can't hear us
now he's taken off the headphones yeah

310
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:47,950
now he's taken off the headphones yeah
 

311
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,830

setup small form-factor pluggable yeah I

322
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:08,620
setup small form-factor pluggable yeah I
 

323
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,170
setup small form-factor pluggable yeah I
never remember cuz I've never used it

324
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,180
never remember cuz I've never used it
 

325
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,200
never remember cuz I've never used it
but it gives you like 10 gig uplink

326
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,210
but it gives you like 10 gig uplink
 

327
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,270
but it gives you like 10 gig uplink
capability and you can use it to connect

328
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:15,280
capability and you can use it to connect
 

329
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,510
capability and you can use it to connect
to a fiber node and whatever else or if

330
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:18,520
to a fiber node and whatever else or if
 

331
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,910
to a fiber node and whatever else or if
you want to have like I scuzzy at 10 gig

332
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:20,920
you want to have like I scuzzy at 10 gig
 

333
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
you want to have like I scuzzy at 10 gig
you can do it over fiber so it's a

334
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,530
you can do it over fiber so it's a
 

335
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,420
you can do it over fiber so it's a
superfast port you know in enterprise

336
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,430
superfast port you know in enterprise
 

337
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,980
superfast port you know in enterprise
yeah I don't need it but in an

338
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:28,990
yeah I don't need it but in an
 

339
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,840
yeah I don't need it but in an
enterprise it makes sense to have that

340
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:30,850
enterprise it makes sense to have that
 

341
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,060
enterprise it makes sense to have that
hmm what do you find solving let's see

342
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,070
hmm what do you find solving let's see
 

343
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,980
hmm what do you find solving let's see
if yeah we can read that oh yeah okay

344
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:40,990
if yeah we can read that oh yeah okay
 

345
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,920
if yeah we can read that oh yeah okay
you you you say something and as soon as

346
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:43,930
you you you say something and as soon as
 

347
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,650
you you you say something and as soon as
subbu says something it'll pin him let's

348
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:46,660
subbu says something it'll pin him let's
 

349
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,970
subbu says something it'll pin him let's
see if I can do it there you go it's

350
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:49,980
see if I can do it there you go it's
 

351
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,870
see if I can do it there you go it's
they have a metal shielding some oh it's

352
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
they have a metal shielding some oh it's
 

353
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,190
they have a metal shielding some oh it's
got a heatsink on it

354
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,200
got a heatsink on it
 

355
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,740
got a heatsink on it
as I say does it say the model of RAM is

356
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:58,750
as I say does it say the model of RAM is
 

357
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,819
as I say does it say the model of RAM is
it is the that a second because that

358
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:04,829
it is the that a second because that
 

359
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,259
it is the that a second because that
heat shield this up and added after the

360
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:07,269
heat shield this up and added after the
 

361
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:17,129
heat shield this up and added after the
fact or is that mmm what model server is

362
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:17,139
fact or is that mmm what model server is
 

363
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,199
fact or is that mmm what model server is
it yeah that's the thing probably check

364
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:19,209
it yeah that's the thing probably check
 

365
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,530
it yeah that's the thing probably check
the server what CCC like error

366
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:24,540
the server what CCC like error
 

367
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,810
the server what CCC like error
correction or something yeah something

368
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:27,820
correction or something yeah something
 

369
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,840
correction or something yeah something
like that I think it's a it's a specific

370
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:30,850
like that I think it's a it's a specific
 

371
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,879
like that I think it's a it's a specific
feature of the RAM and it makes it

372
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:32,889
feature of the RAM and it makes it
 

373
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,040
feature of the RAM and it makes it
completely incompatible actually the

374
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,050
completely incompatible actually the

in their computer to upgrade to Windows
 

427
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,229
in their computer to upgrade to Windows
10 and the computer was too old so we

428
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:41,239
10 and the computer was too old so we
 

429
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,999
10 and the computer was too old so we
suggested I guess one of the technicians

430
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:43,009
suggested I guess one of the technicians
 

431

had suggested well we've we've got this
 

433
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,929
had suggested well we've we've got this
computer in stock you can replace it and

434
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:46,939
computer in stock you can replace it and
 

435
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,389
computer in stock you can replace it and
we'll it's already got Windows 10 on it

436
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:49,399
we'll it's already got Windows 10 on it
 

437

left it in the quarantine room and she
 

443
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,850
left it in the quarantine room and she
came and picked it up and took it on her

444
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:57,860
came and picked it up and took it on her
 

445
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,869
came and picked it up and took it on her
way and lives two hours away so called

446
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:01,879
way and lives two hours away so called
 

447
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,629
way and lives two hours away so called
up that's a man's two hours away that's

448

up that's a man's two hours away that's
 

449
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,850
up that's a man's two hours away that's
a detail it's an important detail

450
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:06,860
a detail it's an important detail
 

451
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,739
a detail it's an important detail
because it's a lot of effort for her to

new computer but the printer is not
 

459
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,679
new computer but the printer is not
working okay well this is pretty typical

working okay well this is pretty typical
 

461
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,720
working okay well this is pretty typical
maybe I got a remote in and maybe set up

462
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:19,730
maybe I got a remote in and maybe set up
 

463
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,189
maybe I got a remote in and maybe set up
the drivers for you because we obviously

464
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
the drivers for you because we obviously
 

465
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,869
the drivers for you because we obviously
didn't set up the printer for her

466
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:22,879
didn't set up the printer for her
 

467
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,030
didn't set up the printer for her
because we didn't have physical access

468
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
because we didn't have physical access
 

469
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,460
because we didn't have physical access
to it so so I said well I'll remote in

470
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,470
to it so so I said well I'll remote in
 

471
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,919
to it so so I said well I'll remote in
and I'll take a look so I did remote it

472
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:29,929
and I'll take a look so I did remote it
 

473
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:32,230
and I'll take a look so I did remote it
in and we have support tools connect

474
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
in and we have support tools connect
 

475
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,590
in and we have support tools connect
wise powered and stuff and couldn't see

476
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
wise powered and stuff and couldn't see
 

477
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,910
wise powered and stuff and couldn't see
the printer from the life of me I

478
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:36,920
the printer from the life of me I
 

479
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,539
the printer from the life of me I
checked even in device manager I can see

480
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:40,549
checked even in device manager I can see
 

481
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:42,789
checked even in device manager I can see
any non detected USB devices somewhat

482

in and set it up and still not seeing
 

497
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,259
in and set it up and still not seeing
the printer so last-ditch effort I said

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:02,269
the printer so last-ditch effort I said
 

499
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,409

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,970
it is anyways we've already noticed that
in the past so it's not keying very well

618
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:33,980
in the past so it's not keying very well
 

619
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,500
in the past so it's not keying very well
so I couldn't see the resistor you were

620
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:35,510
so I couldn't see the resistor you were
 

621
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,080
so I couldn't see the resistor you were
holding up but was it a bad rip was it a

622
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,090
holding up but was it a bad rip was it a
 

623
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,150
holding up but was it a bad rip was it a
bad resistor the guy in a bedroom guys I

624
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
bad resistor the guy in a bedroom guys I
 

625
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,070
bad resistor the guy in a bedroom guys I
think I may I think that booty boy I

626
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,080
think I may I think that booty boy I
 

627
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,070
think I may I think that booty boy I
didn't know but would one of allowed and

628
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
didn't know but would one of allowed and
 

629
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,500
didn't know but would one of allowed and
the guy showed you that betray that guy

630
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,510
the guy showed you that betray that guy
 

631
00:18:50,510 --> 00:19:00,270
the guy showed you that betray that guy
did they died in the car oh no oh no

632
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,280

 

633
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,250

we've seen stuff like that like even in

634
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:03,260
we've seen stuff like that like even in
 

635
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,159
we've seen stuff like that like even in
the single board computing market like

636
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:05,169
the single board computing market like
 

637
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,400
the single board computing market like
there was one that came out that had

638
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,410
there was one that came out that had
 

639
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,950
there was one that came out that had
some some solder joints just below where

640
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:11,960
some some solder joints just below where
 

641
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,400
some some solder joints just below where
the emmc is bill I can't remember which

642
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,410
the emmc is bill I can't remember which
 

643
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,500
the emmc is bill I can't remember which
one that was but you have to actually

644
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:17,510
one that was but you have to actually
 

645
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,870
one that was but you have to actually
put a piece of electrical tape on the

646
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
put a piece of electrical tape on the
 

647
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,789
put a piece of electrical tape on the
bottom side of your emmc otherwise you

648
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:21,799
bottom side of your emmc otherwise you
 

649
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,250
bottom side of your emmc otherwise you
could short it out if your emmc

650
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,260
could short it out if your emmc
 

651
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,169
could short it out if your emmc
card had any metal did you ever hear

652
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:26,179
card had any metal did you ever hear
 

653
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,950
card had any metal did you ever hear
that one it sounds weird

654
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
that one it sounds weird
 

655
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,720
that one it sounds weird
yeah no but you know what I mean so

656
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,730
yeah no but you know what I mean so
 

657
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,289
yeah no but you know what I mean so
where you plug in where you plug in the

658
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:35,299
where you plug in where you plug in the
 

659
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,409
where you plug in where you plug in the
emmc yeah you can see it even on an xu4

660
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:38,419
emmc yeah you can see it even on an xu4
 

661
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:40,480
emmc yeah you can see it even on an xu4
you can see I don't know if you guys can

662
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:40,490
you can see I don't know if you guys can
 

663
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,600
you can see I don't know if you guys can
spot that so here's the emmc and there

664
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:43,610
spot that so here's the emmc and there
 

665
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,820
spot that so here's the emmc and there
are some metal pieces that are like

666
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:45,830
are some metal pieces that are like
 

667
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,260
are some metal pieces that are like
solder for the it looks like the

668
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,270
solder for the it looks like the
 

669
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,680
solder for the it looks like the
the SD card hmm so on the on the bottom

670
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:53,690
the SD card hmm so on the on the bottom
 

671
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,720
the SD card hmm so on the on the bottom
side where the emmc plugs in there's

672
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:55,730
side where the emmc plugs in there's
 

673
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,020
side where the emmc plugs in there's
metal so there were some emmc cards that

674
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,030
metal so there were some emmc cards that
 

675
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,390
metal so there were some emmc cards that
came out that also had metal resistors

676
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:01,400
came out that also had metal resistors
 

677
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,180
came out that also had metal resistors
on the bottom side of the MMC plug did

678
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,190
on the bottom side of the MMC plug did
 

679
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,920
on the bottom side of the MMC plug did
it if you plugged it into this board

680
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:05,930
it if you plugged it into this board
 

681
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,050
it if you plugged it into this board
willy-nilly he would actually make

682
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,060
willy-nilly he would actually make
 

683
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,000
willy-nilly he would actually make
contact with these contacts on the lower

684
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,010
contact with these contacts on the lower
 

685
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,600
contact with these contacts on the lower
side of the PCB and it was short it out

686
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:12,610
side of the PCB and it was short it out
 

687
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,800
side of the PCB and it was short it out
so then you'd fry you know who knows

688
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:14,810
so then you'd fry you know who knows
 

689
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,540
so then you'd fry you know who knows
you'd fry your MMC or whatever so you

690
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:16,550
you'd fry your MMC or whatever so you
 

691
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,280
you'd fry your MMC or whatever so you
just take a piece of electrical tape and

692
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,290
just take a piece of electrical tape and
 

693
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,440
just take a piece of electrical tape and
stick it to the bottom side of your emmc

694
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,450
stick it to the bottom side of your emmc
 

695
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,660
stick it to the bottom side of your emmc
just to protect it a similar kind of

696
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:22,670
just to protect it a similar kind of
 

697
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,120
just to protect it a similar kind of
thing Peter because you got a like you

698
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,130
thing Peter because you got a like you
 

699
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,980
thing Peter because you got a like you
never know you're gonna watch those

700
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:26,990
never know you're gonna watch those
 

701
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,180
never know you're gonna watch those
things eh okay what would the read again

702
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,190
things eh okay what would the read again
 

703
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,760
things eh okay what would the read again
I need to get good it won't you don't

704
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:33,770
I need to get good it won't you don't
 

705
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,270
I need to get good it won't you don't
very good with I don't know Peter what

706
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
very good with I don't know Peter what
 

707
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,980
very good with I don't know Peter what
are you using is this a you is this a

708
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:38,990
are you using is this a you is this a
 

709
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,200
are you using is this a you is this a
USB camera or is it something built into

710
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,210
USB camera or is it something built into
 

711
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:49,110
USB camera or is it something built into
a laptop why do you play really yeah Wow

712
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
a laptop why do you play really yeah Wow
 

713
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,180
a laptop why do you play really yeah Wow
must be an old one man maybe it's an old

714
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,190
must be an old one man maybe it's an old
 

715
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:58,210
must be an old one man maybe it's an old
one they big well sure it's not maybe

716
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,220
one they big well sure it's not maybe
 

717
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,250
one they big well sure it's not maybe
it's yeah maybe it's a setting maybe

718
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,260
it's yeah maybe it's a setting maybe
 

719
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,870
it's yeah maybe it's a setting maybe
like what soul who says maybe it's not

720
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:01,880
like what soul who says maybe it's not
 

721
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,630
like what soul who says maybe it's not
actually using 720p mode so maybe you

722
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
actually using 720p mode so maybe you
 

723
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,850
actually using 720p mode so maybe you
know check out if your windows it's a

724
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:06,860
know check out if your windows it's a
 

725
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,480
know check out if your windows it's a
Windows machine is it or is it Linux

726
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,490
Windows machine is it or is it Linux
 

727
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,250
Windows machine is it or is it Linux
yeah so in Windows just see if you have

728
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,260
yeah so in Windows just see if you have
 

729
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,720
yeah so in Windows just see if you have
a setting to increase the resolution

730
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:13,730
a setting to increase the resolution
 

731
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,150
a setting to increase the resolution
maybe it's using like a really low

732
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,160
maybe it's using like a really low
 

733
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:25,900
maybe it's using like a really low
resolution on the webcam in in the zoom

734
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:25,910
resolution on the webcam in in the zoom
 

735
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:34,660
resolution on the webcam in in the zoom
client I know I I had yeah another one

736
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:34,670
client I know I I had yeah another one
 

737
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,960
client I know I I had yeah another one
you know oh yeah but if it's if it's

738
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:37,970
you know oh yeah but if it's if it's
 

739
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,150
you know oh yeah but if it's if it's
720p there's no way you're pumping out

740
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,160
720p there's no way you're pumping out
 

741
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,000
720p there's no way you're pumping out
720p right now I'll bet that's like 320

742
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,010
720p right now I'll bet that's like 320
 

743
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,230
720p right now I'll bet that's like 320
by 240 yeah if that so so you can

744
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,240
by 240 yeah if that so so you can
 

745
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,940
by 240 yeah if that so so you can
increase the resolution just by changing

746
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:48,950
increase the resolution just by changing
 

747
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,510
increase the resolution just by changing
the setting

748
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
the setting
 

749
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
the setting
you're probably like on like the default

750
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:51,530
you're probably like on like the default
 

751
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,210
you're probably like on like the default
or something well I did they vote in

752
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:55,220
or something well I did they vote in
 

753
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,350
or something well I did they vote in
billion a no-no in your drivers for that

754
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
billion a no-no in your drivers for that
 

755
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,920
billion a no-no in your drivers for that
video camera yeah and also you need to

756
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:02,930
video camera yeah and also you need to
 

757
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,180
video camera yeah and also you need to
check check

758
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,190
check check
 

759
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,170
check check

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,180
in addition to their drivers yeah in the
 

761
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:14,680
in addition to their drivers yeah in the

762
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:14,690
zoom client their settings are where you
 

763
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,540
zoom client their settings are where you
change that maybe you can do that I

764
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,550
change that maybe you can do that I
 

765
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,550
change that maybe you can do that I
don't know if you can do it while you're

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:21,560
don't know if you can do it while you're
 

767
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,410
don't know if you can do it while you're
while you're cat-like while you're in a
