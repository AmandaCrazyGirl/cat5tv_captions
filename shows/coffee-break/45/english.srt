weren't flying at all so yeah and in
 

269
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,070
weren't flying at all so yeah and in
hindsight like well part of you probably

feels like oh I wish I had that right
now because then you could be flying and

274
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:20,069
now because then you could be flying and

yeah and I mean if anybody wanted to
 

283
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,600
yeah and I mean if anybody wanted to
risk getting in the airplane with me

284
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:32,610
risk getting in the airplane with me
 

285
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,909
risk getting in the airplane with me
that probably you know to be smart that

286
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:34,919
that probably you know to be smart that
 

287
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,399
that probably you know to be smart that
probably shouldn't do it so now is your

288
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:37,409
probably shouldn't do it so now is your
 

289
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,529
probably shouldn't do it so now is your
plane enough you've got enough room that

plane enough you've got enough room that
 

291

sure to do is all I would have to do is
crank up the engine the propeller would

312
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:25,349
crank up the engine the propeller would
 

313
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:26,959
crank up the engine the propeller would
generate enough wind because it's right

314
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:26,969
generate enough wind because it's right
 

315
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,640
generate enough wind because it's right
in front of the cockpit right it's right

316
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:28,650
in front of the cockpit right it's right
 

317
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,649
in front of the cockpit right it's right
in front of the Ray the pilot seat so

318
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:30,659
in front of the Ray the pilot seat so
 

319
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:33,769
in front of the Ray the pilot seat so
without that and by the way just so you

320
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:33,779
without that and by the way just so you
 

321
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,529
without that and by the way just so you
know so be if there's no windshield in

322
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:36,539
know so be if there's no windshield in
 

323
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,139
know so be if there's no windshield in
that airplane it's not staying up in the

324
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:39,149
that airplane it's not staying up in the
 

325
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,730
that airplane it's not staying up in the
air because that acts as a big old air

326
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:40,740
air because that acts as a big old air
 

327
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,430
air because that acts as a big old air
scoop and yeah generates so much drag

328
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
scoop and yeah generates so much drag
 

329
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,500
scoop and yeah generates so much drag
that the wings can't generate enough

330
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:45,510
that the wings can't generate enough
 

331
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,230
that the wings can't generate enough
lift to keep the thing up it's probably

332
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
lift to keep the thing up it's probably
 

333
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,420
lift to keep the thing up it's probably
a good safety feature that I can't fly

334
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,430
a good safety feature that I can't fly
 

335
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,100
a good safety feature that I can't fly
without the wing a seal

336
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,110
without the wing a seal
 

337
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,769
without the wing a seal
you could try you might get four yeah

338
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:55,779
you could try you might get four yeah
 

339
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:58,829
you could try you might get four yeah

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:44,509
hacker asking oh really yeah but you're
hacking into fake systems out of the

780
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:44,519
hacking into fake systems out of the
 

781
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,480
hacking into fake systems out of the
game so you just made me think of that

782
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,490
game so you just made me think of that
 

783
00:22:47,490 --> 00:23:02,330
game so you just made me think of that
it just came back so let's have a quick

784
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:02,340
it just came back so let's have a quick
 

785
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,860
it just came back so let's have a quick
chat about rather than because I was I

786
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:05,870
chat about rather than because I was I
 

787
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,779
chat about rather than because I was I
prompted by our discussion on Saturday I

788
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:08,789
prompted by our discussion on Saturday I
 

789
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,539
prompted by our discussion on Saturday I
jumped onto my neck ear router to see

790
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:11,549
jumped onto my neck ear router to see
 

791
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,330
jumped onto my neck ear router to see
what exactly was available to me in

792
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,340
what exactly was available to me in
 

793
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,090
what exactly was available to me in
terms of locking stuff down and all that

794
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,100
terms of locking stuff down and all that
 

795
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,009
terms of locking stuff down and all that
and there's not much there Robbie

796
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:19,019
and there's not much there Robbie
 

797
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:22,310
and there's not much there Robbie
there's not much there this there's a

798
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
there's not much there this there's a
 

799
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,289
there's not much there this there's a
there's a few checkboxes you can click

800
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:24,299
there's a few checkboxes you can click
 

801
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,379
there's a few checkboxes you can click
but it's not real clear what the impact

802
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:27,389
but it's not real clear what the impact
 

803
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:30,499
but it's not real clear what the impact
of those checkboxes is so one of my

804
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:30,509
of those checkboxes is so one of my
 

805
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,119
of those checkboxes is so one of my
questions to you is given the router or

806
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:35,129
questions to you is given the router or
 

807
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,539
questions to you is given the router or
even the firmware to go on the router

808
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:37,549
even the firmware to go on the router
 

809
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,029
even the firmware to go on the router
for instance I could put dd-wrt or or as

810
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
for instance I could put dd-wrt or or as
 

811
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,980
for instance I could put dd-wrt or or as
you said one of the other you know yeah

812
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:44,990
you said one of the other you know yeah
 

813
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,409
you said one of the other you know yeah
firmware versions on the hardware itself

814
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:50,419
firmware versions on the hardware itself
 

815
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:53,090
firmware versions on the hardware itself
so the question I have is what about the

816
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,100
so the question I have is what about the
 

817
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,909
so the question I have is what about the
documentation that goes with it how how

818
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
documentation that goes with it how how
 

819
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,769
documentation that goes with it how how
good is that documentation that goes

820
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:57,779
good is that documentation that goes
 

821
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:02,000
good is that documentation that goes
with that firmware or even a whole rata

822
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,010
with that firmware or even a whole rata
 

823
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,730
with that firmware or even a whole rata
like we were talking about mikrotik last

824
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:04,740
like we were talking about mikrotik last
 

825
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,440
like we were talking about mikrotik last
week how good

826
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,450
week how good
 

827
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,940
week how good
the documentation to to show you and

828
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:10,950
the documentation to to show you and
 

829
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,680
the documentation to to show you and
this might be something you can bring up

830
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,690
this might be something you can bring up
 

831
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,200
this might be something you can bring up
in your in your series you know here's

832
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,210
in your in your series you know here's
 

833
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,780
in your in your series you know here's
what it can do but in order to figure

834
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:17,790
what it can do but in order to figure
 

835
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,180
what it can do but in order to figure
out what it can do you how do i how do I

836
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,190
out what it can do you how do i how do I
 

837
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,880
out what it can do you how do i how do I
relate this button click or this entry

838
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:22,890
relate this button click or this entry
 

839
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,690
relate this button click or this entry
in the rules with what what actually

840
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:26,700
in the rules with what what actually
 

841
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,450
in the rules with what what actually
happens I wonder if that's even one of

842
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:29,460
happens I wonder if that's even one of
 

843
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,730
happens I wonder if that's even one of
the differences maybe that's an answer

844
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:31,740
the differences maybe that's an answer
 

845
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,570
the differences maybe that's an answer
to your question what's the difference

846
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:32,580
to your question what's the difference
 

847
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,690
to your question what's the difference
is you've got a device like the net gear

848
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:35,700
is you've got a device like the net gear
 

849
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,140
is you've got a device like the net gear
whose firmware is meant to be you know

850
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,150
whose firmware is meant to be you know
 

851
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,600
whose firmware is meant to be you know
step one step two step three strip or

852
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,610
step one step two step three strip or
 

853
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,640
step one step two step three strip or
and then you're done like that you're in

854
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:43,650
and then you're done like that you're in
 

855
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,950
and then you're done like that you're in
there's your manual and it's not going

856
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:45,960
there's your manual and it's not going
 

857
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,560
there's your manual and it's not going
to ever deviate from that right where

858
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:48,570
to ever deviate from that right where
 

859
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,140
to ever deviate from that right where
something like an open source firmware

860
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,150
something like an open source firmware
 

861
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,680
something like an open source firmware
like dd-wrt or something like mikrotik I

862
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:54,690
like dd-wrt or something like mikrotik I
 

863
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,930
like dd-wrt or something like mikrotik I
think it's more like here's your getting

864
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:56,940
think it's more like here's your getting
 

865
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,870
think it's more like here's your getting

further because you're talking about

870
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:03,770
further because you're talking about
 

871
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,620
further because you're talking about
like really sophisticated setups and

872
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:06,630
like really sophisticated setups and
 

873
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,150
like really sophisticated setups and
it's gonna be the same at either dd-wrt

874
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,160
it's gonna be the same at either dd-wrt
 

875
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,630
it's gonna be the same at either dd-wrt
or which I'm very well doctors and it

876
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:11,640
or which I'm very well doctors and it
 

877
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,940
or which I'm very well doctors and it
requires that you do need some knowledge

878
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:13,950
requires that you do need some knowledge
 

879
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,920
requires that you do need some knowledge
of networking in order to be able to

880
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:15,930
of networking in order to be able to
 

881
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,980
of networking in order to be able to
effectively apply the rules yes and no

882
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:18,990
effectively apply the rules yes and no
 

883
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,010
effectively apply the rules yes and no
more because you can get into a forum

884
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,020
more because you can get into a forum
 

885
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,750
more because you can get into a forum
and say look I'm new here I'm new to

886
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
and say look I'm new here I'm new to
 

887
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,840
and say look I'm new here I'm new to
networking I need to be able to do this

888
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:26,850
networking I need to be able to do this

what do you guys suggest and you'll

890
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
what do you guys suggest and you'll
 

891
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,820
what do you guys suggest and you'll
probably get some replies and and even

892
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:31,830
probably get some replies and and even
 

893
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,160
probably get some replies and and even
some links to to documentation that'll

894
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,170
some links to to documentation that'll
 

895
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,060
some links to to documentation that'll
help you get there

896
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,070
help you get there
 

897
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,670
help you get there
and so if you're gonna go it alone yes

898
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:37,680
and so if you're gonna go it alone yes
 

899
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,340
and so if you're gonna go it alone yes
you have to have pretty good knowledge

900
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,350
you have to have pretty good knowledge
 

901
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,670
you have to have pretty good knowledge
of networking okay but if you might use

902
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:43,680
of networking okay but if you might use
 

903
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,200
of networking okay but if you might use
a community yeah

904
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,210
a community yeah
 

905
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,000
a community yeah
maybe that's something to highlight in

906
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,010
maybe that's something to highlight in
 

907
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,920
maybe that's something to highlight in
you around yeah and your series when you

908
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:48,930
you around yeah and your series when you
 

909
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,270
you around yeah and your series when you
talk about it I think it's the court in

910
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:53,280
talk about it I think it's the court in
 

911
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,620
talk about it I think it's the court in
my experience the biggest challenge with

912
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:54,630
my experience the biggest challenge with
 

913
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,830
my experience the biggest challenge with
routers is that they use different

914
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
routers is that they use different
 

915
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,140
routers is that they use different
methodologies and different terminology

916
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,150
methodologies and different terminology
 

917
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,030
methodologies and different terminology
to do the same thing the different

918
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,040
to do the same thing the different
 

919
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,140
to do the same thing the different
router true it's true so we've got a

920
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,150
router true it's true so we've got a
 

921
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:10,790
router true it's true so we've got a
enterprise I think it's I think it's

922
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:10,800
enterprise I think it's I think it's
 

923
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,410

Enterprise d-link router here Rock

924
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:12,420
Enterprise d-link router here Rock
 

925
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,200
Enterprise d-link router here Rock
Mountain B link router and we have one's

926
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,210
Mountain B link router and we have one's
 

927
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,160
Mountain B link router and we have one's
a backup failover but to set up like

928
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,170
a backup failover but to set up like
 

929
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,150
a backup failover but to set up like
forward

930
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,160
forward
 

931
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,220
forward
forwarding rule on that thing is a pain

932
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,230
forwarding rule on that thing is a pain
 

933
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,830
forwarding rule on that thing is a pain
in the neck okay on like a home let your

934
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
in the neck okay on like a home let your
 

935
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,110
in the neck okay on like a home let your
router or home d-link router it's a

936
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,120
router or home d-link router it's a
 

937
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,880
router or home d-link router it's a
piece of cake you just go and say which

938
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,890
piece of cake you just go and say which
 

939
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,480
piece of cake you just go and say which
dresser which host name and or and where

940
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:35,490
dresser which host name and or and where
 

941
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,430
dresser which host name and or and where
do you wanted to go and yeah but here

942
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
do you wanted to go and yeah but here
 

943
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,320
do you wanted to go and yeah but here
got a set up like all these steps of

944
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,330
got a set up like all these steps of
 

945
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,040
got a set up like all these steps of
different rules but I think that's

946
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,050
different rules but I think that's
 

947
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,440
different rules but I think that's
intentional I think that's like the neck

948
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,450
intentional I think that's like the neck
 

949
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,750
intentional I think that's like the neck
here the net gear is so simple but it's

950
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
here the net gear is so simple but it's
 

951
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,290
here the net gear is so simple but it's
also its binary mmm either this port

952
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:51,300
also its binary mmm either this port
 

953
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,110
also its binary mmm either this port
this port is either open or closed

954
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,120
this port is either open or closed
 

955
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,350
this port is either open or closed
yep it's a binary decision whereas your

956
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
yep it's a binary decision whereas your
 

957
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,840
yep it's a binary decision whereas your
router and my router these Enterprise

958
00:26:59,840 --> 00:26:59,850
router and my router these Enterprise
 

959
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,970
router and my router these Enterprise
routers are so much more sophisticated

960
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:01,980
routers are so much more sophisticated
 

961
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,400
routers are so much more sophisticated
that it's not it's non binary it's yes

962
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,410
that it's not it's non binary it's yes
 

963
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,800
that it's not it's non binary it's yes
this port is open based upon this

964
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:06,810
this port is open based upon this
 

965
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,570
this port is open based upon this
criteria so these physics yeah it just

966
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:11,580
criteria so these physics yeah it just
 

967
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,520
criteria so these physics yeah it just
is so much more sophisticated as far as

968
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:13,530
is so much more sophisticated as far as
 

969
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,290
is so much more sophisticated as far as
the security goes but you're right it

970
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:17,300

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:48,990
scares me even more because you know

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,740
scares me even more because you know
being able to remotely manage a random

being able to remotely manage a random
 

989
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,910
being able to remotely manage a random
means that if somebody you Betty does a

990
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:55,920
means that if somebody you Betty does a
 

991
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,190
means that if somebody you Betty does a
really good job of in though bp9 like

992
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,200
really good job of in though bp9 like
 

993
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,640
really good job of in though bp9 like
you have to configure which is going to

994
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:01,650
you have to configure which is going to
 

995
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,160
you have to configure which is going to
remotely manage so you can you can't

00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,590
remotely manage so you can you can't
just log on remotely you have to log on

998
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:06,600
just log on remotely you have to log on
 

999
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,810
just log on remotely you have to log on
to management server but you have to but

1000
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:11,820
to management server but you have to but
 

1001
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,850
to management server but you have to but
you're you're taking on it yeah you're

1002
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:13,860
you're you're taking on it yeah you're
 

1003
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,620
you're you're taking on it yeah you're
taking this access point and telling

1004
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:15,630
taking this access point and telling
 

1005
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,970
taking this access point and telling
this access point when you first

1006
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:16,980
this access point when you first
 

1007
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,890
this access point when you first
configure it I want you to be managed by

1008
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:18,900
configure it I want you to be managed by
 

1009
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,200
configure it I want you to be managed by
this server and you're taking the next

1010
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,210
this server and you're taking the next
 

1011
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,670
this server and you're taking the next
access point and saying I want you to be

1012
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:22,680
access point and saying I want you to be
 

1013
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,850
access point and saying I want you to be
managed by this server and this is my

1014
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:24,860
managed by this server and this is my
 

1015
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,530
managed by this server and this is my
server can be an internal server it

1016
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:30,540
server can be an internal server it
 

1017
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,710
server can be an internal server it
doesn't have to be able the internet but

1018
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:33,720
doesn't have to be able the internet but
 

1019
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,710
doesn't have to be able the internet but
brilliant if you've got like oh uh

1020
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:35,720
brilliant if you've got like oh uh
 

1021
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,150
brilliant if you've got like oh uh
because these are wireless devices right

1022
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,160
because these are wireless devices right
 

1023
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,550
because these are wireless devices right
so you can have it let's say you had 25

1024
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:40,560
so you can have it let's say you had 25
 

1025
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,470
so you can have it let's say you had 25
acres of land you could cover this with

1026
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480
acres of land you could cover this with
 

1027
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,770
acres of land you could cover this with
ubiquity devices that have solar panels

1028
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:45,780
ubiquity devices that have solar panels
 

1029
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,090
ubiquity devices that have solar panels
and you've got Wi-Fi throughout the

1030
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,100
and you've got Wi-Fi throughout the
 

1031
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,880
and you've got Wi-Fi throughout the
whole place yeah exactly yeah and if one

1032
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:52,890
whole place yeah exactly yeah and if one
 

1033
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,740
whole place yeah exactly yeah and if one
goes down you can reroute that traffic

1034
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:54,750
goes down you can reroute that traffic
 

1035
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,010
goes down you can reroute that traffic
to another one that's very cool now you

1036
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:58,020
to another one that's very cool now you
 

1037
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,970
to another one that's very cool now you
say the management server you say the

1038
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:01,980
say the management server you say the
 

1039
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,080
say the management server you say the
management server can be in internal it

1040
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,090
management server can be in internal it
 

1041
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,760
management server can be in internal it
can be inside the network it does not

1042
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:07,770
can be inside the network it does not
 

1043
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,280
can be inside the network it does not
have to you don't have to rely on anyone

1044
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,290
have to you don't have to rely on anyone
 

1045
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,530
have to you don't have to rely on anyone
in the cloud to well because that's

1046
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:12,540
in the cloud to well because that's
 

1047
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
in the cloud to well because that's
that's my biggest concern I would not

1048
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:14,550
that's my biggest concern I would not
 

1049
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,940
that's my biggest concern I would not
your server it's you I would not want my

1050
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:16,950
your server it's you I would not want my
 

1051
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,740
your server it's you I would not want my
management server to be up in the

1052
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:18,750
management server to be up in the
 

1053
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,250
management server to be up in the
internet somewhere accessible it would

1054
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,260
internet somewhere accessible it would
 

1055
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:30,440
internet somewhere accessible it would
it would have to be internal some gear

1056
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:30,450
it would have to be internal some gear
 

1057
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,450
it would have to be internal some gear
that it can be a remotely managed the

1058
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:32,460
that it can be a remotely managed the
 

1059
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,120
that it can be a remotely managed the
management server need to be inside my

1060
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,130
management server need to be inside my
 

1061
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,210
management server need to be inside my
house yeah yeah yeah yeah guys I hate to

1062
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,220
house yeah yeah yeah yeah guys I hate to
