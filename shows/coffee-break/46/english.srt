161
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,740
there the printer then metal parts I I
think it's a great idea for like the

162
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:29,750
think it's a great idea for like the
 

163
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,410
think it's a great idea for like the
Mars mission and stuff like that to use

164
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:32,420
Mars mission and stuff like that to use
 

165
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,440
Mars mission and stuff like that to use
it to be able to print tools and Oh what

166
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:35,450
it to be able to print tools and Oh what
 

167
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,930
it to be able to print tools and Oh what
do you got there

168
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:36,940
do you got there
 

169
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,430
do you got there
this is something this is the biggest

170
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
this is something this is the biggest
 

171
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,150
this is something this is the biggest
thing I have 3d printed so far it is the

172
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,160
thing I have 3d printed so far it is the
 

173
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,250
thing I have 3d printed so far it is the
top for a master beaut

174
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,260
top for a master beaut
 

175
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,250
top for a master beaut
and what are you printing are you

176
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:51,260
and what are you printing are you
 

177
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,290
and what are you printing are you
printing that vertical or how did you

178
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,300
printing that vertical or how did you
 

179
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,760
printing that vertical or how did you
have to print that are you gonna you

180
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:57,770
have to print that are you gonna you
 

181
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,530
have to print that are you gonna you
would have to be totally sure then yeah

182
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:02,540
would have to be totally sure then yeah
 

183
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,659
would have to be totally sure then yeah
we do have a printer that'll do a 12

184
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:04,669
we do have a printer that'll do a 12
 

185
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:07,120
we do have a printer that'll do a 12
inch by 12 inch by 14 inch cube so you

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,130
inch by 12 inch by 14 inch cube so you
 

187
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,140
inch by 12 inch by 14 inch cube so you
could actually make a helmet out of it

188
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,150
could actually make a helmet out of it
 

189
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,640
could actually make a helmet out of it
could you make me a Mandalorian costume

190
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:12,650
could you make me a Mandalorian costume
 

191
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:21,610
could you make me a Mandalorian costume
for this Halloween and what's okay and

192
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:21,620
for this Halloween and what's okay and
 

193
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,640
for this Halloween and what's okay and
at $60 an hour one layer at a time

194
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:27,650
at $60 an hour one layer at a time
 

195
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:34,210
at $60 an hour one layer at a time
oh boy so this takes about 10 hours to

196
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,220
oh boy so this takes about 10 hours to
 

197
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,210
oh boy so this takes about 10 hours to
press this particular piece it looks

198
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,220
press this particular piece it looks
 

199
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,800
press this particular piece it looks
like a really like I mean we're looking

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,810
like a really like I mean we're looking
 

201
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,020
like a really like I mean we're looking
at it on a webcam or something but there

202
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,030
at it on a webcam or something but there
 

203
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,640
at it on a webcam or something but there
on your phone but it looks like it's a

204
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:42,650
on your phone but it looks like it's a
 

205
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,089
on your phone but it looks like it's a
pretty smooth print a well the surface

206
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:46,099
pretty smooth print a well the surface
 

207
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:51,580
pretty smooth print a well the surface
is what was on the build plate okay yeah

208
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:51,590
is what was on the build plate okay yeah
 

209
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,760
is what was on the build plate okay yeah
the sides are layered I don't know

210
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:54,770
the sides are layered I don't know
 

211
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,540
the sides are layered I don't know
thinking you just a quick sand and it's

212
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,550
thinking you just a quick sand and it's
 

213
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,960
thinking you just a quick sand and it's
not not a quick sand but you can do

214
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:04,970
not not a quick sand but you can do
 

215
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,430
not not a quick sand but you can do
surface treatment but it's or you can

216
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
surface treatment but it's or you can
 

217
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:28,779
surface treatment but it's or you can
just live love to live it it's them

218
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:28,789
just live love to live it it's them
 

219
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:32,010
just live love to live it it's them
we're gonna call it the modern woodgrain

220
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,020
we're gonna call it the modern woodgrain
 

221
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,690
we're gonna call it the modern woodgrain
the wood grain of 2020s mechanical

222
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:37,700
the wood grain of 2020s mechanical
 

223
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,790
the wood grain of 2020s mechanical
properties were where it's stronger in

224
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:39,800
properties were where it's stronger in
 

225
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,920
properties were where it's stronger in
one direction and in another

226
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:43,930

 

227
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,230

we could also say if you count the

228
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,240
we could also say if you count the
 

229
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,960
we could also say if you count the
layers and you figure it takes

230
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:49,970
layers and you figure it takes
 

231
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,720
layers and you figure it takes
minutes per layer we can actually

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:52,730
minutes per layer we can actually
 

233
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,639
minutes per layer we can actually
determine the age of that print right

234
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:56,649
determine the age of that print right
 

235
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:00,100
determine the age of that print right
yeah oh yeah it's kind of cool because

236
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,110
yeah oh yeah it's kind of cool because
 

237
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,929
yeah oh yeah it's kind of cool because
like these walls are six millimeters

238
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:01,939
like these walls are six millimeters
 

239
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:05,889
like these walls are six millimeters
thick but they're primarily Hollow

240
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:05,899
thick but they're primarily Hollow
 

241
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,639
thick but they're primarily Hollow
there's infill but really so yeah like a

242
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:09,649
there's infill but really so yeah like a
 

243
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:15,699
there's infill but really so yeah like a
honeycomb but it's actually rectilinear

244
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:15,709
honeycomb but it's actually rectilinear
 

245
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,179
honeycomb but it's actually rectilinear
I find rectilinear is easier to print

246
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:19,189
I find rectilinear is easier to print
 

247
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:22,800
I find rectilinear is easier to print
quickly and it's just a supportive

248
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:22,810
quickly and it's just a supportive
 

249
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,079
quickly and it's just a supportive
easier on the printer so rectilinear is

250
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:26,089
easier on the printer so rectilinear is
 

251
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:28,689
easier on the printer so rectilinear is
where one layer it's doing 45 degrees in

252
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:28,699
where one layer it's doing 45 degrees in
 

253
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,220
where one layer it's doing 45 degrees in
one direction and the other layer it

254
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,230
one direction and the other layer it
 

255
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,119
one direction and the other layer it
does forty fed Riis in the other

256
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:31,129
does forty fed Riis in the other
 

257
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:37,860
does forty fed Riis in the other
direction and they just crank each other

258
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:37,870

 

259
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,780

yeah nice

260
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:40,790
yeah nice
 

261
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,850
yeah nice
well I crashed out of zoom I don't know

262
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:42,860
well I crashed out of zoom I don't know
 

263
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,559
well I crashed out of zoom I don't know
what happened but it just suddenly said

264
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:44,569
what happened but it just suddenly said
 

265
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:50,530
what happened but it just suddenly said
oh yeah I see that clone is going away

266
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:50,540
oh yeah I see that clone is going away
 

267
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,509
oh yeah I see that clone is going away
soon I'm sure that's what it did that's

268
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:52,519
soon I'm sure that's what it did that's
 

269
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,980
soon I'm sure that's what it did that's
what it did to me just the other day

270
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:53,990
what it did to me just the other day
 

271
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,290
what it did to me just the other day
yeah I mean it just crashed right out of

272
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:56,300
yeah I mean it just crashed right out of
 

273
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,809
yeah I mean it just crashed right out of
it and it wouldn't rejoin the meeting I

274
00:09:58,809 --> 00:09:58,819
it and it wouldn't rejoin the meeting I
 

275
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,460
it and it wouldn't rejoin the meeting I
had to create a head to completely exit

276
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:00,470
had to create a head to completely exit
 

277
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,079

I mean you don't want a surgical robot

310
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:05,220
I mean you don't want a surgical robot
 

311

I was seen some news this week about the

316
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:12,810
I was seen some news this week about the
 

317
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,380
I was seen some news this week about the
the new touch device have you guys seen

318
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,390
the new touch device have you guys seen
 

319
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,150
the new touch device have you guys seen
that the thing that you attach to your

320
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,160
that the thing that you attach to your
 

321
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,880
that the thing that you attach to your
shoulder and then it has strings a

322
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:19,890
shoulder and then it has strings a
 

323
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,710
shoulder and then it has strings a
string for each finger and your wrist

324
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
string for each finger and your wrist
 

325
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,780
string for each finger and your wrist
did you guys see that no we're gonna be

326
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:23,790
did you guys see that no we're gonna be
 

327
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,360
did you guys see that no we're gonna be
talking about it tomorrow on the show

328
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,370
talking about it tomorrow on the show
 

329
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,060
talking about it tomorrow on the show
it's a it's a touch a new way of doing

330
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,070
it's a it's a touch a new way of doing
 

331
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,840
it's a it's a touch a new way of doing
touching virtual reality so when you

332
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:32,850
touching virtual reality so when you
 

333
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,019
touching virtual reality so when you
touch an object you actually feel it so

334
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:36,029
touch an object you actually feel it so
 

335
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,360
touch an object you actually feel it so
like a wall or like product or something

336
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,370
like a wall or like product or something
 

337
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,190
like a wall or like product or something
but I was thinking wouldn't that be neat

338
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,200
but I was thinking wouldn't that be neat
 

339
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,980
but I was thinking wouldn't that be neat
if they could use that and and allow

340
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:42,990
if they could use that and and allow
 

341
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,920
if they could use that and and allow
like a medical professional to do

342
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:45,930
like a medical professional to do
 

343
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,530
like a medical professional to do
surgery with a surgical robot like if

344
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:48,540
surgery with a surgical robot like if
 

345
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,150
surgery with a surgical robot like if
they kind of adapt up the technologies

346
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
they kind of adapt up the technologies
 

347
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,670
they kind of adapt up the technologies
as long as you get good feedback on the

348
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:52,680
as long as you get good feedback on the
 

349
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,199
as long as you get good feedback on the
resistance of the object that you're

350
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:54,209
resistance of the object that you're
 

351
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,050
resistance of the object that you're
touching yeah I don't think that it's

352
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,060
touching yeah I don't think that it's
 

353
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,139
touching yeah I don't think that it's
one thing to just did a bleep if you're

354
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:00,149
one thing to just did a bleep if you're
 

355
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,210
one thing to just did a bleep if you're
touching something but if you tap

356
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,220
touching something but if you tap
 

357
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,220
touching something but if you tap
something hard versus just tapping it

358
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,230
something hard versus just tapping it
 

359
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,490
something hard versus just tapping it
softly yeah what's neat about that I

360
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:07,500
softly yeah what's neat about that I
 

361
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,079
softly yeah what's neat about that I
mean there's not the there's not enough

362
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:09,089
mean there's not the there's not enough
 

363
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,569
mean there's not the there's not enough
there's not enough to it like it's very

364
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:11,579
there's not enough to it like it's very
 

365
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,990
there's not enough to it like it's very
it's like six strings right so when you

366
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,000
it's like six strings right so when you
 

367
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,600
it's like six strings right so when you
touch something so if there's a wall I

368
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:17,610
touch something so if there's a wall I
 

369
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,000
touch something so if there's a wall I
could feel that wall in that when I

370
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,010
could feel that wall in that when I
 

371
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,780
could feel that wall in that when I
touch here I feel the resistance so I

372
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:23,790
touch here I feel the resistance so I
 

373
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,519
touch here I feel the resistance so I
can feel like that but I couldn't like

374
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:25,529
can feel like that but I couldn't like
 

375
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,019
can feel like that but I couldn't like
it's not tactile like I couldn't hold a

376
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:27,029
it's not tactile like I couldn't hold a
 

377
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,400
it's not tactile like I couldn't hold a
pair of scissors or something like that

378
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,410
pair of scissors or something like that
 

379
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,519
pair of scissors or something like that
in in VR but wouldn't that be neat I

380
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:31,529
in in VR but wouldn't that be neat I
 

381
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:32,870
in in VR but wouldn't that be neat I
mean you think about the evolution of

382
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
mean you think about the evolution of
 

383
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,720
mean you think about the evolution of
how things how quickly things move could

384
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:35,730
how things how quickly things move could
 

385
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,880
how things how quickly things move could
result in something like that so what is

386
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:37,890
result in something like that so what is
 

387
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,920
result in something like that so what is
this what's the board that you guys are

388
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:39,930
this what's the board that you guys are
 

389
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,880
this what's the board that you guys are
working on Bo well all we know is that

390
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:43,890
working on Bo well all we know is that
 

391
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,319
working on Bo well all we know is that
it's a surgical robot that's yeah that

392
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:48,329
it's a surgical robot that's yeah that
 

393
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:51,400
it's a surgical robot that's yeah that
it's a control system it has nice or no

394
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,410
it's a control system it has nice or no
 

395
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,769
it's a control system it has nice or no
Ethernet on it and it has power

396
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:54,779
Ethernet on it and it has power
 

397
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,310
Ethernet on it and it has power
connectors and MOSFETs and

398
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320

 

399
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,759

no no it's a discreet device mm-hmm

400
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:04,769
no no it's a discreet device mm-hmm
 

401
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:07,220
no no it's a discreet device mm-hmm
but somebody approached us and said hey

402
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,230
but somebody approached us and said hey
 

403
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,170
but somebody approached us and said hey
we need to have some of these assembled

404
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,180
we need to have some of these assembled
 

405
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,639
we need to have some of these assembled
can you do that and Ron yeah we've got

406
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:10,649
can you do that and Ron yeah we've got
 

407
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,949
can you do that and Ron yeah we've got
all the equipment to do that so you guys

408
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
all the equipment to do that so you guys
 

409
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,570
all the equipment to do that so you guys
have droid in your name yeah yeah

410
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:16,580
have droid in your name yeah yeah
 

411
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,509
have droid in your name yeah yeah
it does it does it need to operate in a

412
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
it does it does it need to operate in a
 

413
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,460
it does it does it need to operate in a
in a sterile environment like in your in

414
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,470
in a sterile environment like in your in
 

415
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,620
in a sterile environment like in your in
the o'er so does it need to be

416
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:26,630
the o'er so does it need to be
 

417
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,680
the o'er so does it need to be
sterilizable I'm not sure if this part

418
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:29,690
sterilizable I'm not sure if this part
 

419
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,720
sterilizable I'm not sure if this part
actually isn't the robot part of it or

420
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:31,730
actually isn't the robot part of it or
 

421
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,720
actually isn't the robot part of it or
in the control part of it okay either

422
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:34,730
in the control part of it okay either
 

423
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,519
in the control part of it okay either
case it's both in the operating rooms

424
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:36,529
case it's both in the operating rooms
 

425
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:39,220
case it's both in the operating rooms
though so I'm sure they'll both go

426
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,230
though so I'm sure they'll both go
 

427
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,340
though so I'm sure they'll both go
through a rigorous sterilization process

428
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,350
through a rigorous sterilization process
 

429
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,810
through a rigorous sterilization process
yeah just be careful about little

430
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:43,820
yeah just be careful about little
 

431
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,300
yeah just be careful about little
corners and crooks and any I mean nooks

432
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,310
corners and crooks and any I mean nooks
 

433
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,960
corners and crooks and any I mean nooks
and crannies to make sure that you can

434
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:49,970
and crannies to make sure that you can
 

435
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,170
and crannies to make sure that you can
get into those easily to clean ya up

436
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,180
get into those easily to clean ya up
 

437
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,960
get into those easily to clean ya up
we'll just think they gave us a whole

438
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:55,970
we'll just think they gave us a whole
 

439
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:03,639
we'll just think they gave us a whole
list of requirements very nice that's

440
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:03,649
list of requirements very nice that's
 

441
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,579
list of requirements very nice that's
really a attack and it controlled and

442
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:06,589
really a attack and it controlled and
 

443
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:13,240
really a attack and it controlled and
there are important things the surgeons

444
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,250
there are important things the surgeons
 

445
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,210
there are important things the surgeons
operating like some kind of control

446
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,220
operating like some kind of control
 

447
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,790
operating like some kind of control
levers or something and then the arms

448
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
levers or something and then the arms
 

449
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,530
levers or something and then the arms
are mirroring that probably in a so a

450
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:23,540
are mirroring that probably in a so a
 

451
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,960
are mirroring that probably in a so a
small alert a large motion on this end

452
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:25,970
small alert a large motion on this end
 

453
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,370
small alert a large motion on this end
makes a very small motion on the other

454
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:27,380
makes a very small motion on the other
 

455
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,560
makes a very small motion on the other
end where the robot is operating hmm I'm

456
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,570
end where the robot is operating hmm I'm
 

457
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,560
end where the robot is operating hmm I'm
picturing it says sat on the side and

458
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:35,570
picturing it says sat on the side and
 

459
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,350
picturing it says sat on the side and
it's got one of those big scoops yeah it

460
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
it's got one of those big scoops yeah it
 

461
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,130
it's got one of those big scoops yeah it
may will do what me how far away is the

462
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,140
may will do what me how far away is the
 

463
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,030
may will do what me how far away is the
surgeon from the actual device the

464
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,040
surgeon from the actual device the
 

465
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,269
surgeon from the actual device the
country you're in the same room I know

466
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
country you're in the same room I know
 

467
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,130
country you're in the same room I know
they've used surgical robots in

468
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,140
they've used surgical robots in
 

469
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,990
they've used surgical robots in
Antarctica and other places where

470
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,000
Antarctica and other places where
 

471
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Antarctica and other places where
surgeons needed to operate on somebody

472
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:01,610
surgeons needed to operate on somebody
 

473
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,400
surgeons needed to operate on somebody
but they didn't have a surgeon on-site

474
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,410
but they didn't have a surgeon on-site
 

475
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,420
but they didn't have a surgeon on-site
so one of those telesurgery units or if

476
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,430
so one of those telesurgery units or if
 

477
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,579
so one of those telesurgery units or if
it's just one like for brain surgeons

478
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:12,589
it's just one like for brain surgeons
 

479
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,750
it's just one like for brain surgeons
where they're needing to make that make

480
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:16,760
where they're needing to make that make
 

481
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,870
where they're needing to make that make
their motions very controlled you'd

482
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:19,880
their motions very controlled you'd
 

483
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,579
their motions very controlled you'd
think one of the requirements would be

484
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:21,589
think one of the requirements would be
 

485
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:27,880
think one of the requirements would be
you know rock-solid Internet yeah using

486
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:27,890
you know rock-solid Internet yeah using
 

487
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,449
you know rock-solid Internet yeah using
DSL

488
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:29,459
DSL
 

489
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,489

tactical would have rock-solid internet

490
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:31,499
tactical would have rock-solid internet
 

491
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:35,989
tactical would have rock-solid internet
you know I just can't visualize that if

492
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:35,999
you know I just can't visualize that if
 

493
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,540
you know I just can't visualize that if
it's a life-and-death situation you work

494
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:38,550
it's a life-and-death situation you work
 

495
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,400
it's a life-and-death situation you work
with what you've got

496

with what you've got
 

497
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,929

is some pretty heavy-duty stuff that
 

523
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:29,410
is some pretty heavy-duty stuff that
they're doing with this telesurgery

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:09,510
too long ago you saw a video you know
 

545
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:17,879
too long ago you saw a video you know
we're gonna jump on you for that

code maintenance at NASA had that talk

548
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
code maintenance at NASA had that talk
 

549
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,949
code maintenance at NASA had that talk
about it is a few years ago one of the

over at that time had an appetizer

554
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:34,749
over at that time had an appetizer
 

555
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:39,999
over at that time had an appetizer
15,000 days and it still oh yeah imagine

556
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:40,009
15,000 days and it still oh yeah imagine
 

557
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,999
15,000 days and it still oh yeah imagine
the latency the sending up command and

558
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:43,009
the latency the sending up command and
 

559
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,979
the latency the sending up command and
they have to wait until the next day or

560
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:44,989
they have to wait until the next day or
 

561
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:51,219
they have to wait until the next day or
the next two days can you imagine can

562
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:51,229
the next two days can you imagine can
 

563
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:52,659
the next two days can you imagine can
you imagine writing a computer program

564
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:52,669
you imagine writing a computer program
 

565
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,940
you imagine writing a computer program
that has to control this hard way and

566
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:54,950
that has to control this hard way and
 

567
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,159
that has to control this hard way and
the computer program can not fail now

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:00,169
the computer program can not fail now
 

569

the computer program can not fail now
you know it's one thing your master and

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,190
you know it's one thing your master and
 

571
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,159
you know it's one thing your master and
it's one thing if you've got a young if

572
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:06,169
it's one thing if you've got a young if
 

573
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,940
it's one thing if you've got a young if
you've got a program that runs it at

574
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:09,950
you've got a program that runs it at
 

575
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,950
you've got a program that runs it at
work or whatever on on the mainframe or

Alena do what you got to do to fix it
but that's not gonna be an option when

00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:18,859
but that's not gonna be an option when

by Microsoft Windows now the thing is I

590
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:46,479
by Microsoft Windows now the thing is I
 

591
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:49,089
by Microsoft Windows now the thing is I
wanted to I'm sorry with your so because

592
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:49,099
wanted to I'm sorry with your so because
 

593
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,759
wanted to I'm sorry with your so because
I want to point out that the pipe time

594
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:51,769
I want to point out that the pipe time
 

595
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,430
I want to point out that the pipe time
and while nowhere near as critical has a

596
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:54,440
and while nowhere near as critical has a
 

597
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,070
and while nowhere near as critical has a
similar issue right because what you

598
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,080
similar issue right because what you
 

599
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,599
similar issue right because what you
have to do is implement things called

600
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:58,609
have to do is implement things called
 

601
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,269
have to do is implement things called
watchdog timers so that if the thing

602
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:01,279
watchdog timers so that if the thing
 

603
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,940
watchdog timers so that if the thing
gets in a loop or gets caught up or get

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:03,950
gets in a loop or gets caught up or get

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,369
gets in a loop or gets caught up or get
messed up somehow it's watched on time I

606
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:06,379
messed up somehow it's watched on time I
 

607
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,070
messed up somehow it's watched on time I
will just reset it to a known state and

608
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,080
will just reset it to a known state and
 

609
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,009
will just reset it to a known state and
start again so and I I suspect Sabu if

610
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:15,019
start again so and I I suspect Sabu if
 

611
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,599
start again so and I I suspect Sabu if
you can correct me if I'm wrong but I

612
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:16,609
you can correct me if I'm wrong but I
 

613
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:19,269
you can correct me if I'm wrong but I
suspect they use a similar technique on

614
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:19,279
suspect they use a similar technique on
 

615
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,210
suspect they use a similar technique on
that Voyager program - right well in

616
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,220
that Voyager program - right well in
 

617
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,489
that Voyager program - right well in
addition to that they have they have two

618
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:26,499
addition to that they have they have two
 

619
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,810
addition to that they have they have two
completely independent systems

620
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:29,820
completely independent systems
 

621
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,720
completely independent systems
that or mirroring each other and never

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:35,730
that or mirroring each other and never
 

623
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,240
that or mirroring each other and never
one of them have failed one or two times

624
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,250
one of them have failed one or two times
 

625
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,650
