00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:16,399
embarrassing all right so that's not
 

779
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:23,999
embarrassing all right so that's not
what the Raspberry Pi cameras for boys

780
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:24,009

 

781
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:26,860

stick with the wide angle lens agamotto

782
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:26,870
stick with the wide angle lens agamotto
 

783
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,029
stick with the wide angle lens agamotto
I don't want to see you buying a

784
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:28,039
I don't want to see you buying a
 

785
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,009
I don't want to see you buying a
telephoto oddly enough I am one of the

786
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:33,019
telephoto oddly enough I am one of the
 

787
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,560
telephoto oddly enough I am one of the
least technologically houses in the

788
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,570
least technologically houses in the
 

789
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,940
least technologically houses in the
world because I just don't trust all

790
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:36,950
world because I just don't trust all
 

791
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,830
world because I just don't trust all
that stuff in the household yet yeah

792
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:38,840
that stuff in the household yet yeah
 

793
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,659
that stuff in the household yet yeah
maybe that's what I what I find

794
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:40,669
maybe that's what I what I find
 

795
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:41,769
maybe that's what I what I find
intriguing about it though is that

796
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:41,779
intriguing about it though is that
 

797
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:44,619
intriguing about it though is that
because it's Raspberry Pi you are the

798
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:44,629
because it's Raspberry Pi you are the
 

799
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:47,590
because it's Raspberry Pi you are the
one in control of what it does so like

800
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
one in control of what it does so like
 

801
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,160
one in control of what it does so like
ring

802
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,170
ring
 

803
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,300
ring
you don't know where it's sending your

804
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:49,310
you don't know where it's sending your
 

805
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:54,250
you don't know where it's sending your
data yeah it's the idea I love the idea

806
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,260
data yeah it's the idea I love the idea
 

807
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,380
data yeah it's the idea I love the idea
but I just don't like that it's in

808
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,390
but I just don't like that it's in
 

809
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,240
but I just don't like that it's in
someone else's control but your data

810
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,250
someone else's control but your data
 

811
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,910
someone else's control but your data
isn't someone else's control yeah yeah

812
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:00,920
isn't someone else's control yeah yeah
 

813
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,530
isn't someone else's control yeah yeah
so here's here you could make your own

814
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:02,540
so here's here you could make your own
 

815
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,270
so here's here you could make your own
out of the Raspberry Pi if you want to

816
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,280
out of the Raspberry Pi if you want to
 

817
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,850
out of the Raspberry Pi if you want to
do well one of the one I think I've

818
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:06,860
do well one of the one I think I've
 

819
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,800
do well one of the one I think I've
mentioned to have a Synology box and one

820
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:08,810
mentioned to have a Synology box and one
 

821
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,440
mentioned to have a Synology box and one
of the apps on yeah particular box is

822
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,450
of the apps on yeah particular box is
 

823
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,750
of the apps on yeah particular box is
called surveillance station you can

824
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
called surveillance station you can
 

825
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,240
called surveillance station you can
mount cameras around the outside of your

826
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,250
mount cameras around the outside of your
 

827
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,270
mount cameras around the outside of your
building you come and have it all

828
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
building you come and have it all
 

829
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,580
building you come and have it all
controlled by the Synology box itself so

830
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:21,590
controlled by the Synology box itself so
 

831
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,810
controlled by the Synology box itself so
it's all it's it's all your data you

832
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:25,820
it's all it's it's all your data you
 

833
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,270
it's all it's it's all your data you
know your images storing it on your

834
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,280
know your images storing it on your
 

835
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,220
know your images storing it on your
drive doesn't go anywhere else does it

836
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,230
drive doesn't go anywhere else does it
 

837
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,990
drive doesn't go anywhere else does it
just use like any IP camera that it

838
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,000
just use like any IP camera that it
 

839
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,240
just use like any IP camera that it
finds on the network yeah on the website

840
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,250
finds on the network yeah on the website
 

841
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,010
finds on the network yeah on the website
they've got some they've got some

842
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,020
they've got some they've got some
 

843
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,180
they've got some they've got some
recommended cameras that you can go

844
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,190
recommended cameras that you can go
 

845
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,280
recommended cameras that you can go
catch you don't have to buy one from

846
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,290
catch you don't have to buy one from
 

847
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,650
catch you don't have to buy one from
them or anything you just use no no no

848
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:47,660
them or anything you just use no no no
 

849
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,570
them or anything you just use no no no
they just say you can use any of these

850
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:49,580
they just say you can use any of these
 

851
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,750
they just say you can use any of these
and they'll work you know you point your

852
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:52,760
and they'll work you know you point your
 

853
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,720
and they'll work you know you point your
Synology box to it and it will go the

854
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:55,730
Synology box to it and it will go the
 

855
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,880
Synology box to it and it will go the
issue though is that you only get a

856
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:57,890
issue though is that you only get a
 

857
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,370
issue though is that you only get a
license for like one or two cameras if

858
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:00,380
license for like one or two cameras if
 

859
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,950
license for like one or two cameras if
you want to add more cameras than you oh

860
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
you want to add more cameras than you oh
 

861
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,800
you want to add more cameras than you oh
ah see that's what I want to get away

862
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:05,810
ah see that's what I want to get away
 

863
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,140
ah see that's what I want to get away
from is the throw you gotta put more

864
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,150
from is the throw you gotta put more
 

865
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,870
from is the throw you gotta put more
money into it in order to get better

866
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
money into it in order to get better
 

867
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,180
money into it in order to get better
