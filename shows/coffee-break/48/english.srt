00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:51,360

should be functional it'll be nice yeah

164
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,370

 

165
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,629

probably yeah yeah absolutely but

166
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:55,639
probably yeah yeah absolutely but
 

167
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,070
probably yeah yeah absolutely but
originally I was thinking we'd have the

168
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,080
originally I was thinking we'd have the
 

169
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,159
originally I was thinking we'd have the
jacks built into the platform but but

170
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:00,169
jacks built into the platform but but
 

171
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,750
jacks built into the platform but but
the more I think about it and the more

172
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:01,760
the more I think about it and the more
 

173
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,580
the more I think about it and the more
that I kind of get familiar with the

174
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:03,590
that I kind of get familiar with the
 

175
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,219
that I kind of get familiar with the
space I think building a platform might

176
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:06,229
space I think building a platform might
 

177
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,810
space I think building a platform might
restrict us to that spot there well just

178
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:10,820
restrict us to that spot there well just
 

179
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,700
restrict us to that spot there well just
move things around though in the future

180
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:12,710
move things around though in the future
 

181
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,920
move things around though in the future
yeah if you're thinking it just gives us

182
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:14,930
yeah if you're thinking it just gives us
 

183
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,529
yeah if you're thinking it just gives us
more flexibility to be able to not be

184
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:17,539
more flexibility to be able to not be
 

185
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,140
more flexibility to be able to not be
trapped in that one area of the studio

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:25,820
change things up so I'm starting to lean
 

193
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,810
change things up so I'm starting to lean
that way some so the so the backdrop

194
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:28,820
that way some so the so the backdrop
 

195
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,540
that way some so the so the backdrop
that you're talking about were you

196
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:31,550
that you're talking about were you
 

197
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,400
that you're talking about were you
meaning to drape over the blue wall that

198
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,410
meaning to drape over the blue wall that
 

199
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,050
meaning to drape over the blue wall that
you painted because you painted that

200
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,060
you painted because you painted that
 

201
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,560
you painted because you painted that
blue wall as a backdrop didn't you yeah

202
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,570
blue wall as a backdrop didn't you yeah
 

203
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,810
blue wall as a backdrop didn't you yeah
the what are your thinking well the

204
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:43,820
the what are your thinking well the
 

205
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,550
the what are your thinking well the
backdrop system is going on the gray

206
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:45,560
backdrop system is going on the gray
 

207
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,570
backdrop system is going on the gray
wall so you know the the wall that's

208
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:49,580
wall so you know the the wall that's
 

209
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,390
wall so you know the the wall that's
kitty-corner to where the sunlight comes

kitty-corner to where the sunlight comes
 

211
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,670
kitty-corner to where the sunlight comes
in so that wall is going to have a

212
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:54,680
in so that wall is going to have a
 

213
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,700
in so that wall is going to have a
seven-foot drape on it so mush or drape

214
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:57,710
seven-foot drape on it so mush or drape
 

215
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,200
seven-foot drape on it so mush or drape
system I should say so there's three

216
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,210
system I should say so there's three
 

217

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,650
downloaded the OVA so I deployed it on
 

319
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,459
downloaded the OVA so I deployed it on
the virtualization hypervisor it just as

320
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:37,469
the virtualization hypervisor it just as
 

321
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,770
the virtualization hypervisor it just as
a test and now it's in production

322
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:39,780
a test and now it's in production
 

323
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,279
a test and now it's in production
because it's amazing it's incredible so

324
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,289
because it's amazing it's incredible so
 

325
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,530
because it's amazing it's incredible so
it's it

326
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:44,540
it's it
 

327
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,110
it's it
seems to me like it's better than Google

328
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
seems to me like it's better than Google
 

329
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,290

Drive but it's self hosted you deployed

330
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,300
Drive but it's self hosted you deployed
 

331
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,370
Drive but it's self hosted you deployed
what's that yeah we nice cloud server VM

332
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:03,380
what's that yeah we nice cloud server VM
 

333
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,439
what's that yeah we nice cloud server VM
so github.com slash next cloud / vm and

334
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:10,449
so github.com slash next cloud / vm and
 

335
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,509
so github.com slash next cloud / vm and
there's a downloadable OVA file so I

336
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
there's a downloadable OVA file so I
 

337
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,949
there's a downloadable OVA file so I
downloaded that and deployed it so so

338
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
downloaded that and deployed it so so
 

339
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,319
downloaded that and deployed it so so
first thing I did is I set a Samba share

340
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:20,329
first thing I did is I set a Samba share
 

341
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:23,050
first thing I did is I set a Samba share
on my storage server and I used that for

342
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,060
on my storage server and I used that for
 

343
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,050
on my storage server and I used that for
the storage and then I realized well now

344
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,060
the storage and then I realized well now
 

345
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,850
the storage and then I realized well now
I've got local storage on the virtual

346
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:27,860
I've got local storage on the virtual
 

347
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,900
I've got local storage on the virtual
appliance and Samba storage so I removed

348
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:31,910
appliance and Samba storage so I removed
 

349
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,809
appliance and Samba storage so I removed
that and instead set up an FS tab entry

350
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:34,819
that and instead set up an FS tab entry
 

351
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:38,379
that and instead set up an FS tab entry
and replaced the the root folder storage

352
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:38,389
and replaced the the root folder storage
 

353
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,160
and replaced the the root folder storage
folder with the Samba share so so all of

354
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,170
folder with the Samba share so so all of
 

355
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,900
folder with the Samba share so so all of
the storage for next cloud is now moved

356
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:43,910
the storage for next cloud is now moved
 

357
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,660
the storage for next cloud is now moved
on to my storage server so it's part of

358
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:46,670
on to my storage server so it's part of
 

359
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,340
on to my storage server so it's part of
my backup set and everything else but

360
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,350
my backup set and everything else but
 

361
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,530
my backup set and everything else but
and it's encrypted but it gives me like

362
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:52,540
and it's encrypted but it gives me like
 

363
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,879
and it's encrypted but it gives me like
well I can set up user accounts than I

364
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:54,889
well I can set up user accounts than I
 

365
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,160
well I can set up user accounts than I
can set their quota myself so if I want

366
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,170
can set their quota myself so if I want
 

367
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,900
can set their quota myself so if I want
to give somebody 500 gigs of space

368
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:58,910
to give somebody 500 gigs of space
 

369
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,689
to give somebody 500 gigs of space
I just 500 gigs degree yesterday but

370
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:04,699
I just 500 gigs degree yesterday but

381
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,569
say yeah you said I was calling it
because I was calling the ambient noise

382
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:22,579
because I was calling the ambient noise
 

383
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:29,290

ambient noise no really what did I say
 

385
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,389
ambient noise no really what did I say
what did I say did I say wavetable yeah

386
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
what did I say did I say wavetable yeah
 

387

post could you imagine the amount of
 

421
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,769
post could you imagine the amount of
work for the hour and a half video so

422
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:35,779
work for the hour and a half video so

cancellation in there plus we run

430
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:47,540
cancellation in there plus we run
 

431
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,320
cancellation in there plus we run
everything through I would do it at to

432
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,330
everything through I would do it at to
 

433
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,620
everything through I would do it at to
bubble it so what does either stay to go

434
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,630
bubble it so what does either stay to go
 

435

of my boys would be offend pretty much
 

441
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,860
of my boys would be offend pretty much
as I did with a sound which is the back

442
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:05,870
as I did with a sound which is the back
 

443
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,280
as I did with a sound which is the back
of our throat because I used a different

different muscles of our brave voice and
 

447
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,720
different muscles of our brave voice and
he's pretty much like in my voice that's

448

he's pretty much like in my voice that's
 

449
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,940
he's pretty much like in my voice that's
why tied to their valve spring and

why tied to their valve spring and
 

451
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,980
why tied to their valve spring and
that's was a bit wary because of the

I do that is kind of like a final step
 

469
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,019
I do that is kind of like a final step
in the audio chain but I only look at it

in the audio chain but I only look at it
 

471
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,180
in the audio chain but I only look at it
as a foul that I always do noise

472
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,190
as a foul that I always do noise

785
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,550
literally seen multiple people modifying
different parts of the same file at the

786
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:42,560
different parts of the same file at the
 

787
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,510
different parts of the same file at the
same time straight it's amazing we did

788
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:46,520
same time straight it's amazing we did
 

789
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,790
same time straight it's amazing we did
that on my show we do that on my show I

790
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:48,800
that on my show we do that on my show I
 

791
00:22:48,800 --> 00:23:03,430
that on my show we do that on my show I
shared a public and I think you can do

792
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,440
shared a public and I think you can do
 

793
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,710
shared a public and I think you can do
the same thing with honestly I have not

794
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:05,720
the same thing with honestly I have not
 

795
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,200
the same thing with honestly I have not
tried it because as I say I'm quickly

796
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,210
tried it because as I say I'm quickly
 

797
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,450
tried it because as I say I'm quickly
away from those proprietary formats but

798
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:10,460
away from those proprietary formats but
 

799
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,390
away from those proprietary formats but
yeah I think this analogy can do the

800
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:13,400
yeah I think this analogy can do the
 

801
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,810
yeah I think this analogy can do the
same

802
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:13,820
same
 

803
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,360
same
is that true for your next clip account

804
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,370
is that true for your next clip account
 

805
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,100
is that true for your next clip account
is where you actually haven't tried it

806
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,110
is where you actually haven't tried it
 

807
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,250
is where you actually haven't tried it
I'm the sole you well I've added a few

808
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,260
I'm the sole you well I've added a few
 

809
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,210
I'm the sole you well I've added a few
users to it I should add you guys to it

810
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:25,220
users to it I should add you guys to it
 

811
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,800
users to it I should add you guys to it
and then you can let me know well that

812
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:26,810
and then you can let me know well that
 

813
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,140
and then you can let me know well that
all boils down to it all boils down to

814
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,150
all boils down to it all boils down to
 

815
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,760
all boils down to it all boils down to
whether you need that functionality

816
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:30,770
whether you need that functionality
 

817
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,640
whether you need that functionality
right that sure would be neat for I

818
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:33,650
right that sure would be neat for I
 

819
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,470
right that sure would be neat for I
think it's it's pretty collaborative

820
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:35,480
think it's it's pretty collaborative
 

821
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,160
think it's it's pretty collaborative
like it even has a built-in video

822
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,170
like it even has a built-in video
 

823
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,130
like it even has a built-in video
chatting service mm-hmm so you so you

824
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,140
chatting service mm-hmm so you so you
 

825
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,430
chatting service mm-hmm so you so you
can have like a zoom meeting but locally

826
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
can have like a zoom meeting but locally
 

827
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,520
can have like a zoom meeting but locally
like on your own server so that's and of

828
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,530
like on your own server so that's and of
 

829
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,200
like on your own server so that's and of
course all let the paint on here with

830
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,210
course all let the paint on here with
 

831
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,590
course all let the paint on here with

your
 

833
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,330
your
in turn it is but it's up and down line

834
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,340
in turn it is but it's up and down line
 

835
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,060
in turn it is but it's up and down line
because your audience has to be strong

836
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,070
because your audience has to be strong
 

837
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:01,120

still call your show off yeah just have

842
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:12,710
still call your show off yeah just have
 

843
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,260
still call your show off yeah just have
to give you some space on my next cloud

844
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,270
to give you some space on my next cloud
 

845
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:24,820
to give you some space on my next cloud
server and then you can yeah

846
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:24,830
server and then you can yeah
 

847

Rob you're gonna be doing a review of

848
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,330
Rob you're gonna be doing a review of
 

849
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,659
Rob you're gonna be doing a review of
next want to grow upcoming shows

850
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:28,669
next want to grow upcoming shows
 

851
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:31,779
next want to grow upcoming shows
oh I sure AM yeah absolutely right I'll

852
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:31,789
oh I sure AM yeah absolutely right I'll
 

853
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:34,049
oh I sure AM yeah absolutely right I'll
do the whole yeah I'll do the whole

854
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:34,059
do the whole yeah I'll do the whole
 

855
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,640
do the whole yeah I'll do the whole
deployment and everything and you can

856
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:36,650
deployment and everything and you can
 

857
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,289
deployment and everything and you can
put it on a Raspberry Pi or something -

858
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:38,299
put it on a Raspberry Pi or something -
 

859
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,230
put it on a Raspberry Pi or something -
I don't know if you'd really want to but

860
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
I don't know if you'd really want to but
 

861
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,919
I don't know if you'd really want to but
maybe an HC HC one or something would be

862
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:44,929
maybe an HC HC one or something would be
 

863
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:53,230
maybe an HC HC one or something would be
an appropriate unit right yeah yeah like

864
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,240
an appropriate unit right yeah yeah like
 

865
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,360
an appropriate unit right yeah yeah like
so stick an SSD on there like a terabyte

866
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,370
so stick an SSD on there like a terabyte
 

867
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,200
so stick an SSD on there like a terabyte
SSD and you've got a problem with the

868
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,210
SSD and you've got a problem with the
 

869
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,919
SSD and you've got a problem with the
next cloud and that is because it is a

870
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:02,929
next cloud and that is because it is a
 

871
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:05,380
next cloud and that is because it is a
four called own cloud which is started

872
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:05,390
four called own cloud which is started
 

873
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,279
four called own cloud which is started
that is when you upgrade you have to

874
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:09,289
that is when you upgrade you have to
 

875
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:13,210
that is when you upgrade you have to
upgrade each major versions in between

876
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:13,220
upgrade each major versions in between
 

877
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,549
upgrade each major versions in between
so if you're free for instance have a

878
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:15,559
so if you're free for instance have a
 

879
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,860
so if you're free for instance have a
next level 14 dots something and you

880
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:19,870
next level 14 dots something and you
 

881
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:27,580
next level 14 dots something and you
don't follow a dates always have the

882
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:27,590
don't follow a dates always have the
 

883
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,430
don't follow a dates always have the
latest and you the latest debian after

884
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:30,440
latest and you the latest debian after
 

885
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,360
latest and you the latest debian after
two years uh-huh and I'm just picking

886
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,370
two years uh-huh and I'm just picking
 

887
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,690
two years uh-huh and I'm just picking
and numbers of my head but if you have

888
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:36,700
and numbers of my head but if you have
 

889
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,930
and numbers of my head but if you have
them from the next 114 - next cloud 17

890
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:40,940
them from the next 114 - next cloud 17
 

891
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,270
them from the next 114 - next cloud 17
you have to 15 16 and on each major

892
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:46,280
you have to 15 16 and on each major
 

893
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,730
you have to 15 16 and on each major
versions you can't offend oh you have

894
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:48,740
versions you can't offend oh you have
 

895
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,110
versions you can't offend oh you have
poor you have - all over again

896
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
poor you have - all over again
 

897
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,010
poor you have - all over again
yeah that is the only problem I have I

898
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,020
yeah that is the only problem I have I
 

899
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,390
yeah that is the only problem I have I
don't have a problem with that because I

900
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:01,400
don't have a problem with that because I
 

901
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,190
don't have a problem with that because I
would just export my config and redeploy

902
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
would just export my config and redeploy
 

903
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,090
would just export my config and redeploy
a new deployment

904
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,100
a new deployment
 

905
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,760
a new deployment
personally that's how I would do it and

906
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:06,770
personally that's how I would do it and
 

907
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,590
personally that's how I would do it and
then and then because I'm going to be

908
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:08,600
then and then because I'm going to be
 

909
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,659
then and then because I'm going to be
presumably upgrading hardware at that

910
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:10,669
presumably upgrading hardware at that
 

911
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:31,200
presumably upgrading hardware at that
point anyways or something right so

912
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,210

 

913
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,960

right yeah methodology unit yeah I

914
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:37,970
right yeah methodology unit yeah I
 

915
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,140
right yeah methodology unit yeah I
remember the first time I shared a file

916
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,150
remember the first time I shared a file
 

917
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,169
remember the first time I shared a file
from my local computer with a friend on

918
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:44,179
from my local computer with a friend on
 

919
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:50,950
from my local computer with a friend on
the Internet kaydee to two point

920
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
the Internet kaydee to two point
 

921
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,950
the Internet kaydee to two point
something I think it was in Red Hat 7.1

922
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:53,960
something I think it was in Red Hat 7.1
 

923
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,299
something I think it was in Red Hat 7.1
and Acadia 2 had ability in the small

924
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:58,309
and Acadia 2 had ability in the small
 

925
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,810
and Acadia 2 had ability in the small
file server where you could configure it

926
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:01,820
file server where you could configure it
 

927
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,240
file server where you could configure it
to share a specific file and you could

928
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,250
to share a specific file and you could
 

929
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,830
to share a specific file and you could
configure it to share the file until it

930
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:08,840
configure it to share the file until it
 

931
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,950
configure it to share the file until it
has been don't know that X amount of

932
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:11,960
has been don't know that X amount of
 

933
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,539
has been don't know that X amount of
time so you only need one or two times

934
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:16,549
time so you only need one or two times
 

935
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:19,570
time so you only need one or two times
then it would stop sharing that file hmm

936
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:19,580
then it would stop sharing that file hmm
 

937
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,330
then it would stop sharing that file hmm
kind of like how I have my my cedars set

938
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:22,340
kind of like how I have my my cedars set
