763
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,470
expecting from them from mr. Blahous
I mean maybe that's the interesting

764
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
I mean maybe that's the interesting
 

765
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,499
I mean maybe that's the interesting
thing is like if you had a like vp9 if

766
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:23,509
thing is like if you had a like vp9 if
 

767
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:26,710
thing is like if you had a like vp9 if
you had a series circuit that was like a

768
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
you had a series circuit that was like a
 

769
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,000
you had a series circuit that was like a
five or twelve volt

770
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,010
five or twelve volt
 

771
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,950
five or twelve volt
circuit then you could power the LED

772
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:29,960
circuit then you could power the LED
 

773
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,930
circuit then you could power the LED
bulbs and then maybe you could say you

774
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:31,940
bulbs and then maybe you could say you
 

775
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,549
bulbs and then maybe you could say you
could claim that they'd last a lot

776
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:33,559
could claim that they'd last a lot
 

777
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,560
could claim that they'd last a lot
longer like 30 years or something but I

778
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,570
longer like 30 years or something but I
 

779
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,330
longer like 30 years or something but I
think what happens is like the bulbs

780
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:37,340
think what happens is like the bulbs
 

781
