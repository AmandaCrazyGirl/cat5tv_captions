281
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,810
what's interesting we're all starting to
see this where okay so we're all kind of

282
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:35,820
see this where okay so we're all kind of
 

283
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,600
see this where okay so we're all kind of
placed all around the world but there's

284
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,610
placed all around the world but there's
 

285
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,970
placed all around the world but there's
such a demand on the infrastructure for

286
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:40,980
such a demand on the infrastructure for
 

287
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,300
such a demand on the infrastructure for
things like zoom and all these kind of

288
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,310
things like zoom and all these kind of
 

289
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,280
things like zoom and all these kind of
remote meeting and telepresence

290
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,290
remote meeting and telepresence
 

291
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,280
remote meeting and telepresence
applications so not only are the

292
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,290
applications so not only are the
 

293
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,180
applications so not only are the
platforms being really taxed like zoom

294
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,190
platforms being really taxed like zoom
 

295
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,970
platforms being really taxed like zoom
but also the the actual infrastructure

296
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:55,980
but also the the actual infrastructure
 

297
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,090
but also the the actual infrastructure
of the internet because everybody's work

298
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,100
of the internet because everybody's work
 

299
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,220
of the internet because everybody's work
from home so we're just saying like your

300
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,230
from home so we're just saying like your
 

301
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,900
from home so we're just saying like your
remoted into your desktop computer at

302
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:02,910
remoted into your desktop computer at
 

303
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,390
remoted into your desktop computer at
work well where's that bandwidth coming

304
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
work well where's that bandwidth coming
 

305
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,760
work well where's that bandwidth coming
from so all of a sudden all you had was

306
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:07,770
from so all of a sudden all you had was
 

307

a staff of 50 people all working from
 

309
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,920
a staff of 50 people all working from
home and that's 50 times the bandwidth

310
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:12,930
home and that's 50 times the bandwidth
 

311
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,150
home and that's 50 times the bandwidth
that they used to use yeah we're bound

312
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,160

766
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,130
that by you know clocking down cores and
 

767
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,160
that by you know clocking down cores and

being used and things like that I were

770
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:28,810
being used and things like that I were
 

771
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,570
being used and things like that I were
to mention the screen and the modem

772
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:30,580
to mention the screen and the modem
 

773
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,850
to mention the screen and the modem
would be or the radio would be the thing

774
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:32,860
would be or the radio would be the thing
 

775
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,850
would be or the radio would be the thing
that such most power right yeah I think

bluetooth keyboard it works directly
with them with most phones anyway be

860
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
with them with most phones anyway be
 

861
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,310
with them with most phones anyway be
interesting to see if it work with Linux

862
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:49,320

 

863
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,500

if we could find a way beau to get to

864
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,510
if we could find a way beau to get to
 

865
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,320

get Bill over there a pine phone then I

866
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,330
get Bill over there a pine phone then I
 

867
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,570
get Bill over there a pine phone then I
could I could port NEMS Linux to pine

868
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:57,580
could I could port NEMS Linux to pine
 

869
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:07,670
could I could port NEMS Linux to pine
phone because he's my better tester yeah

870

we've lot again you're back oh okay yeah

872
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:11,850
we've lot again you're back oh okay yeah
 

873
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,950
we've lot again you're back oh okay yeah
that's the only one I've got right now

874
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
that's the only one I've got right now
 

875
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,340
that's the only one I've got right now
is this one there is no high demand in

876
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:19,350
is this one there is no high demand in
 

877
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,970
is this one there is no high demand in
short supply but are you using that as a

878
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:22,980
short supply but are you using that as a
 

879
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,390
short supply but are you using that as a
daily driver but no not yet it's not

880
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
daily driver but no not yet it's not
 

881
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,920
daily driver but no not yet it's not
quite there it's getting closer probably

882
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:30,930
quite there it's getting closer probably
 

883
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,750
