would be it would have been analyzed at

468
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,250
would be it would have been analyzed at
 

469
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,129
would be it would have been analyzed at
every couple years right but you can

470
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:24,139
every couple years right but you can
 

471
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,290
every couple years right but you can
actually you can use the historical view

472
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,300
actually you can use the historical view
 

473
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
actually you can use the historical view
and you can go back in time which is a

474
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,310
and you can go back in time which is a
 

475
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,300
and you can go back in time which is a
really cool feature because as Google

476
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,310
really cool feature because as Google
 

477
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,790
really cool feature because as Google
Maps gets older and older like you can

478
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:33,800
Maps gets older and older like you can
 

479
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,509
Maps gets older and older like you can
now go back five six years in time on a

480
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
now go back five six years in time on a
 

481
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,180
now go back five six years in time on a
historical graph so you can look at a

482
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,190
historical graph so you can look at a
 

483
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,889
historical graph so you can look at a
construction site where there's a

484
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:41,899
construction site where there's a
 

485
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,840
construction site where there's a
building and then go back in time and

486
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:43,850
building and then go back in time and
 

487
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,850
building and then go back in time and
you can see that they were building it a

488
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:45,860
you can see that they were building it a
 

489
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,350
you can see that they were building it a
year ago and then the year before that

490
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
year ago and then the year before that
 

491
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,730
year ago and then the year before that
it was just a field like you can

492
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:48,740
it was just a field like you can
 

493
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,069
it was just a field like you can
actually see that then you landed on

494
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:51,079
actually see that then you landed on
 

495
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,769
actually see that then you landed on
that on street view as well or just on

496
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:53,779
that on street view as well or just on
 

497
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,030
that on street view as well or just on
Google Maps

498
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
Google Maps
 

499
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,019
Google Maps
yeah I think it's only on Street View oh

500
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:58,029
yeah I think it's only on Street View oh
 

501
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,150
yeah I think it's only on Street View oh
it's like it's the updated imagery based

502
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,160
it's like it's the updated imagery based
 

503
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,660
it's like it's the updated imagery based
on every time the car so it becomes like

504
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:04,670
on every time the car so it becomes like
 

505
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:33,340
on every time the car so it becomes like
a historical point in time and they have

506
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,350
a historical point in time and they have
 

507
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:50,410
a historical point in time and they have
arranged yeah if you could plan it out

508
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:50,420
arranged yeah if you could plan it out
 

509
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,120
arranged yeah if you could plan it out
ahead of time and figure out the route

510
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,130
ahead of time and figure out the route
 

511
00:16:52,130 --> 00:17:23,470
ahead of time and figure out the route
that is going to be taking place and

512
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:23,480
that is going to be taking place and
 

513
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,039
that is going to be taking place and
they did some planning and some checking

514
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,049
they did some planning and some checking
 

515
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,500
they did some planning and some checking
and calculating and

516
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,510
and calculating and
 

517
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,770
and calculating and
and they managed to when they when the

518
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:32,780
and they managed to when they when the
 

519
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,900
and they managed to when they when the

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,230
okay so programming language programming
 

627
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:33,790
okay so programming language programming
language yeah I don't know no idea I've

628
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:33,800
language yeah I don't know no idea I've
 

629
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,340
language yeah I don't know no idea I've
been meaning to look into Lua to see if

630
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,350
been meaning to look into Lua to see if
 

631
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,770
been meaning to look into Lua to see if
I can't do anything about programming on

632
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:38,780
I can't do anything about programming on
 

633
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,190
I can't do anything about programming on
what I do remind wrist yeah and what I

634
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,200
what I do remind wrist yeah and what I
 

635
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,140
what I do remind wrist yeah and what I
remember from being a mind test

636
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,150
remember from being a mind test
 

637
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,930
remember from being a mind test
developer is it's a very efficient

638
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:46,940
developer is it's a very efficient
 

639
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,910
developer is it's a very efficient
language like it runs really efficiently

640
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:50,920
language like it runs really efficiently
 

641
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,220
language like it runs really efficiently
it works with a litter box well this is

642
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,230
it works with a litter box well this is
 

643
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,120
it works with a litter box well this is
the interpreter door

644
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,130
the interpreter door
 

645
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,330
the interpreter door
that or is it compiled Robbie do you

646
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:58,340
that or is it compiled Robbie do you
 

647
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,900
that or is it compiled Robbie do you
remember you know I want to say it runs

648
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:04,910
remember you know I want to say it runs
 

649
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,350
remember you know I want to say it runs
it from the script but but yet it can be

650
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,360
it from the script but but yet it can be
 

651
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,730
it from the script but but yet it can be
compiled so I'm not sure on that I think

652
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:12,740
compiled so I'm not sure on that I think
 

653
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,610
compiled so I'm not sure on that I think
it can be either or because I mean I'll

654
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:15,620
it can be either or because I mean I'll
 

655
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,160
it can be either or because I mean I'll
make the blanket statement and I'll let

656
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,170
make the blanket statement and I'll let
 

657
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,320
make the blanket statement and I'll let
you'll discuss but I would say that a

658
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,330
you'll discuss but I would say that a
 

659
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,380
you'll discuss but I would say that a
compiled language something that you're

660
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,390
compiled language something that you're
 

661
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,690
compiled language something that you're
compiling to machine code is going to be

662
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:25,700
compiling to machine code is going to be
 

663
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,170
compiling to machine code is going to be
far more efficient oh no scribbling so

664
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,180
far more efficient oh no scribbling so
 

665
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,090
far more efficient oh no scribbling so
and maybe you're maybe you're right

666
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,100
and maybe you're maybe you're right
 

667
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,210
and maybe you're maybe you're right
there maybe it is a script language

668
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,220
there maybe it is a script language
 

669
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,810
there maybe it is a script language
because it's it seems like if I was to

670
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:37,820
because it's it seems like if I was to
 

671
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,430
because it's it seems like if I was to
compare it to anything that I've worked

672
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
compare it to anything that I've worked
 

673
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:48,270
compare it to anything that I've worked
in I would say it falls close to Java

674
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,280

 

675
00:22:48,280 --> 00:23:12,940

maybe like when you took a two kids we

676
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,950
maybe like when you took a two kids we
 

677
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,980
maybe like when you took a two kids we
call it here in Canada yeah yeah we

678
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:17,990
call it here in Canada yeah yeah we
 

679
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,050
call it here in Canada yeah yeah we
don't have those kind of hats so I don't

680
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,060
don't have those kind of hats so I don't
 

681
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,720
don't have those kind of hats so I don't
even know what we call them here we did

682
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:22,730
even know what we call them here we did
 

683
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,350
even know what we call them here we did
snow

684

687
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,460
Oh bp9 yes sir yes sir are you telling
me that you still got snow even now in

688
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,470
me that you still got snow even now in
 

689
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,910
me that you still got snow even now in
May oh look at that oh you sure do look

690
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:36,920
May oh look at that oh you sure do look
 

691
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:44,890
May oh look at that oh you sure do look
at that oh boy but it's May

693
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,140
at that oh boy but it's May
it's almost a wandering eye on severely

694
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,150
it's almost a wandering eye on severely
 

695
00:23:47,150 --> 00:24:00,850
it's almost a wandering eye on severely
depressed you know I'm muting peering

696
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:00,860
depressed you know I'm muting peering
 

697
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:08,440
depressed you know I'm muting peering
Peter Iban based on better way

698
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,450

 

699
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,420

in the backyard somebody walks by in a

700
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,430
in the backyard somebody walks by in a
 

701

707
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,210
layers on all right 20 degrees I'm not
gonna tell you what my temperature here

708
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,220
gonna tell you what my temperature here
 

709
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,950
gonna tell you what my temperature here
is cuz you know I don't want to be

710
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:35,960
is cuz you know I don't want to be
 

711
00:24:35,960 --> 00:25:12,100
is cuz you know I don't want to be
banned as well so okay so by contrast by

712
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,110
banned as well so okay so by contrast by
 

713
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,120
banned as well so okay so by contrast by
contrast my server room at work is

714
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,130
contrast my server room at work is
 

715
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,540
contrast my server room at work is
warmer from what's outside

716
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,550
warmer from what's outside
 

717
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,900
warmer from what's outside
I actually had I had to turn off the

718
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:22,910
I actually had I had to turn off the
 

719
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,870
I actually had I had to turn off the
server room AC unit yesterday at work

720
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:25,880
server room AC unit yesterday at work
 

721
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,830
server room AC unit yesterday at work
because it had frozen up oh boy

722
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:28,840
because it had frozen up oh boy
 

723
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,650
because it had frozen up oh boy
because it was it was below zero outside

724
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:31,660
because it was it was below zero outside
 

725
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:38,770
because it was it was below zero outside
and it draws the outside air yeah so we

726
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:38,780
and it draws the outside air yeah so we
 

727
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,420
and it draws the outside air yeah so we
got temperature warnings in the server

728
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,430
got temperature warnings in the server
 

729
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,780
got temperature warnings in the server
room because the AC unit was frozen to

730
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,790
room because the AC unit was frozen to
 

731
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,040
room because the AC unit was frozen to
cold the AC was too cold coming in from

732
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,050
cold the AC was too cold coming in from
 

733
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,510
cold the AC was too cold coming in from
out like draw in the air in from outside

734
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520
out like draw in the air in from outside
 

735
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,100
out like draw in the air in from outside
so it froze up and they couldn't blow

736
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,110
so it froze up and they couldn't blow
 

737
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,050
so it froze up and they couldn't blow
cold air into the unit but you could

738
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:53,060
cold air into the unit but you could
 

739
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,030
cold air into the unit but you could
still just turn the fans on right still

740
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,040
still just turn the fans on right still
 

741
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,700
still just turn the fans on right still
get cold air from outside filter core 98

742
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:57,710
get cold air from outside filter core 98
 

743
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,560
get cold air from outside filter core 98
yeah so I turned off the AC and turn on

744
00:25:59,560 --> 00:25:59,570
yeah so I turned off the AC and turn on
 

745
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,150
yeah so I turned off the AC and turn on
the blower yeah you're just not getting

746
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,160
the blower yeah you're just not getting
 

747
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,810
the blower yeah you're just not getting
the benefits of the condensation and you

748
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:04,820
the benefits of the condensation and you
 

749
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,760
the benefits of the condensation and you
know lowering the humidity that sort of

750
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:06,770
know lowering the humidity that sort of
 

751
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:22,060
know lowering the humidity that sort of
stuff so yeah

752
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,070

 

753
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,540
