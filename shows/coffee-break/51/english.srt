middle of their church service so I
 

45
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,450
middle of their church service so I
waited just until they left and then I

46
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:17,460
waited just until they left and then I
 

47
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,160
waited just until they left and then I

supply so I thought maybe I could take

72
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
supply so I thought maybe I could take
 

73
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,289
supply so I thought maybe I could take
two 12-volt power supplies and put them

74
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:00,299
two 12-volt power supplies and put them
 

75
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,600
two 12-volt power supplies and put them
in a parallel circuit so that if one

76
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,610
in a parallel circuit so that if one
 

77
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,190
in a parallel circuit so that if one
fails the other one will pick up the

78
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,200
fails the other one will pick up the
 

79
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,620
fails the other one will pick up the
slack I thought maybe that would be a

did i do so so when I came in the power

202
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:32,890
did i do so so when I came in the power
 

203
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,060
did i do so so when I came in the power
on the server was off so I figured it's

204
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,070
on the server was off so I figured it's
 

205
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,520

either the entire thing has exploded

206
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:38,530
either the entire thing has exploded
 

207
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,490
either the entire thing has exploded
internally or the power supply so hey

208
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:41,500
internally or the power supply so hey
 

209
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,830
internally or the power supply so hey
let's start with the power supply so

210
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
let's start with the power supply so
 

211
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,570
let's start with the power supply so
unplug that took it down to the

212
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,580
unplug that took it down to the
 

213
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,330
unplug that took it down to the
workbench and hooked a multimeter up to

214
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:48,340
workbench and hooked a multimeter up to
 

215
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,780
workbench and hooked a multimeter up to
it and I was getting 8 volt consistently

216
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:50,790
it and I was getting 8 volt consistently
 

217
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,950
it and I was getting 8 volt consistently
looked at the power supply and it says

218
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
looked at the power supply and it says
 

219
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,780
looked at the power supply and it says
it's supposed to be feeding 12 so I'm

220
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:54,790
it's supposed to be feeding 12 so I'm
 

221
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,680
it's supposed to be feeding 12 so I'm
okay not right so I grabbed we've got a

222
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:58,690
okay not right so I grabbed we've got a
 

223
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,870
okay not right so I grabbed we've got a
good supply of power supply so I grabbed

224
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
good supply of power supply so I grabbed
 

225
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,420
good supply of power supply so I grabbed
another 12 volt preamp adapter and

226
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,430
another 12 volt preamp adapter and
 

227
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,670
another 12 volt preamp adapter and
checked it and I was getting a good 12

228
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
checked it and I was getting a good 12
 

229
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,310
checked it and I was getting a good 12
volts so plugged it in and fired her up

230
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,320
volts so plugged it in and fired her up
 

231
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,070
volts so plugged it in and fired her up
came back online

232
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
came back online
 

233
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,040
came back online
yeah I had that happen to me 10 years

234
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,050
yeah I had that happen to me 10 years
 

235
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,219
yeah I had that happen to me 10 years
ago maybe more my ADSL modem it turned

236
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:20,229
ago maybe more my ADSL modem it turned
 

237
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,620
ago maybe more my ADSL modem it turned
out to be the DSL modem and I came home

238
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:22,630
out to be the DSL modem and I came home
 

239
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:29,240
out to be the DSL modem and I came home
afterward after church and noticed that

240
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,250
afterward after church and noticed that
 

241
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,120
afterward after church and noticed that
my my entire network no computer had

242
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,130
my my entire network no computer had
 

243
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,719
my my entire network no computer had
access to anything and I figured out

244
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:36,729
access to anything and I figured out
 

245
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,480
access to anything and I figured out
that it was my gateway computer it looks

246
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,490
that it was my gateway computer it looks
 

247
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,410
that it was my gateway computer it looks
like it had died

248
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:40,420
like it had died
 

249
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,470
like it had died
so I rebooted it and I still couldn't

250
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:43,480
so I rebooted it and I still couldn't
 

251
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:51,360
so I rebooted it and I still couldn't
collect no datp it had a static IP and

252
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,370
collect no datp it had a static IP and
 

253
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,210
collect no datp it had a static IP and
all my assets that economy and have

254
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,220
all my assets that economy and have
 

255
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,270
all my assets that economy and have
guests today need ATP but then I screen

256
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
guests today need ATP but then I screen
 

257
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,500
guests today need ATP but then I screen
from one of my that system no show not

258
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,510
from one of my that system no show not
 

259
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,110
from one of my that system no show not
it was if it was even online and

260
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,120
it was if it was even online and
 

261
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,230
it was if it was even online and
connected to the internet with a very

262
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:13,240
connected to the internet with a very
 

263
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,680
connected to the internet with a very
slower speed and then if I figure out

264
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:16,690
slower speed and then if I figure out
 

265
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:44,120
slower speed and then if I figure out
that it was the DSL and noise and and it

266
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,130

 

267
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,910

it lost it lost connection with my local

268
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:47,920
it lost it lost connection with my local
 

269
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,000
it lost it lost connection with my local
local area network we did not lose

270
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,010
local area network we did not lose
 

271
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,340
local area network we did not lose
correction to the SM or M for some

272
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,350
correction to the SM or M for some
 

273
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,060
correction to the SM or M for some
reason so so b1 bill I can tell you what

274
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,070
reason so so b1 bill I can tell you what
 

275
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,160
reason so so b1 bill I can tell you what
happened there probably your DNS went

276
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,170
happened there probably your DNS went
 

277
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:04,410
happened there probably your DNS went
down and if not if not that then

278
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:04,420
down and if not if not that then
 

279
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,190
down and if not if not that then
probably if your router was the gateway

280
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,200
probably if your router was the gateway
 

281
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,050
probably if your router was the gateway
oh wait you said the DSL modem yeah

282
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,060
oh wait you said the DSL modem yeah
 

283
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,910
oh wait you said the DSL modem yeah
I'm thinking the Gateway ordered or the

284
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm thinking the Gateway ordered or the
 

285
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,700
I'm thinking the Gateway ordered or the
DNS went down or something and stop that

286
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:17,710
DNS went down or something and stop that
 

287
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,370
DNS went down or something and stop that
can stop each of your computers on your

288
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:20,380
can stop each of your computers on your
 

289
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,190
can stop each of your computers on your
local network from talking to each other

290

291
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,460

could I have a switch had a switch that

292
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,470
could I have a switch had a switch that
 

293
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,400
could I have a switch had a switch that
was still powered on so my computer had

294
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,410
was still powered on so my computer had
 

295
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,190
was still powered on so my computer had
internal access to each other big static

system okay and and as soon as I

300
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,060
system okay and and as soon as I
 

301
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,140
system okay and and as soon as I
unplugged the DSL modem all access to my

unplugged the DSL modem all access to my
 

303
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,340
unplugged the DSL modem all access to my
gateway in the computer it was was was

up again only by
 

307
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,329
up again only by
unplugging the DSL modem trainer yeah

308
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:58,339
unplugging the DSL modem trainer yeah
 

309
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:08,240
unplugging the DSL modem trainer yeah
switchable five volts so I and I use

switchable five volts so I and I use
that until a switch is PR year later any

really good at reading cater well yeah
 

587
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,500
really good at reading cater well yeah
you know these days you could probably

588
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,510
you know these days you could probably
 

589
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,330
you know these days you could probably
have a go at writing a full text search

590
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:38,340
have a go at writing a full text search
 

591
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,030
have a go at writing a full text search
engine and yeah but but you know

592
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
engine and yeah but but you know
 

593
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,560
engine and yeah but but you know
question is would you put any effort

594
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,570
question is would you put any effort
 

595
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,330
question is would you put any effort
into something like that if there was

596
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:44,340
into something like that if there was
 

597
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,000
into something like that if there was
any kind of traction on going for and

598
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,010
any kind of traction on going for and
 

599
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,730
any kind of traction on going for and
I'm just not I'm not sure it's new yeah

600
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:49,740
I'm just not I'm not sure it's new yeah
 

601
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm just not I'm not sure it's new yeah
I'm not sure it's worth spending the

602
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:51,510
I'm not sure it's worth spending the
 

603
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,050
I'm not sure it's worth spending the
time on it would it be would it be so

604
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,060
time on it would it be would it be so
 

605
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,090
time on it would it be would it be so
lightweight though that you could set up

606
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,100
lightweight though that you could set up
 

607
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,780
lightweight though that you could set up
like a raspberry pie absolutely yeah

608

chucking a gopher server up on the
 

617
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,170
chucking a gopher server up on the

so it used a different set of tones than
 

937
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,570
so it used a different set of tones than
what American modems did so if I if I
