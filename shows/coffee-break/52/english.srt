so much you guys are so helpful because
I was a desire to take two power

56
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,020
I was a desire to take two power
 

57
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,920
I was a desire to take two power
adapters and and I've talked about this

58
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:30,930
adapters and and I've talked about this
 

59
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,390
adapters and and I've talked about this
for my my the 1u rackmount unit that I'm

60
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:35,400
for my my the 1u rackmount unit that I'm
 

61
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,190
for my my the 1u rackmount unit that I'm
building with all the single board

62
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
building with all the single board
 

63
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,050
building with all the single board
computers I want to do the same thing

64
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,060
computers I want to do the same thing
 

65
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,670
computers I want to do the same thing
where I have a dual redundant power

66
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:40,680
where I have a dual redundant power
 

67
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,910
where I have a dual redundant power
supply so basically two power supplies

68
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
supply so basically two power supplies
 

69
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,889
supply so basically two power supplies
going in with the same voltage same

70
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:45,899
going in with the same voltage same
 

71
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,590
going in with the same voltage same
amperage and if one dies the other one

72
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:48,600
amperage and if one dies the other one
 

73
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,069
amperage and if one dies the other one
just continues running everything so

74
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,079
just continues running everything so
 

75
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,810
just continues running everything so
between Peter and bp9 I learned

76
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:53,820
between Peter and bp9 I learned
 

77
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,240
between Peter and bp9 I learned
yesterday that I need to put diodes and

78
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,250
yesterday that I need to put diodes and
 

79
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,609
yesterday that I need to put diodes and
Peter took the time to even do a diagram

80
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:58,619
Peter took the time to even do a diagram
 

81
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,950
Peter took the time to even do a diagram
for me which was simple enough that I

82
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
for me which was simple enough that I
 

83
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,280
for me which was simple enough that I
understood it so thank you and it showed

84
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,290
understood it so thank you and it showed
 

85
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,789
understood it so thank you and it showed
as the power is coming in to have that

86
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:07,799
as the power is coming in to have that
 

87
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,279
as the power is coming in to have that
diode there and it will prevent the

88
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:10,289
diode there and it will prevent the
 

89
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,980
diode there and it will prevent the
feedback of power coming back into the

90
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:12,990
feedback of power coming back into the
 

91
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,560
feedback of power coming back into the
former so that's going to be an easy

92
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,570
former so that's going to be an easy
 

93
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,350
former so that's going to be an easy
upgrade and Peter also provided me a

94
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,360
upgrade and Peter also provided me a
 

95
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,680
upgrade and Peter also provided me a
link to the Cote UK Amazon so that I

96
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:21,690
link to the Cote UK Amazon so that I
 

97
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,260
link to the Cote UK Amazon so that I
could see the product and so I then took

98
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,270
could see the product and so I then took
 

99
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,680
could see the product and so I then took
that over to amazon.ca because I'm in

100
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:27,690
that over to amazon.ca because I'm in
 

101
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,990
that over to amazon.ca because I'm in
Canada and I found a very similar

102
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
Canada and I found a very similar
 

103
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,030
Canada and I found a very similar
product and it's like seven dollars for

104
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
product and it's like seven dollars for
 

105
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,930
product and it's like seven dollars for
five of them did i order that so I know

108
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,490
Kiera did you get out that they know
 

109
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,120
Kiera did you get out that they know
because goods of job great did you it

110
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,130
because goods of job great did you it
 

111
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,760
because goods of job great did you it
was in that shortly if you had to buy

me Peter I don't care about the man but

118
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
me Peter I don't care about the man but
 

119
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,730
me Peter I don't care about the man but
I care about his diodes you know that

120
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:55,740
I care about his diodes you know that
 

121
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,100
I care about his diodes you know that
but he was a great dog yeah that's what

122
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,110
but he was a great dog yeah that's what
 

123
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,980
but he was a great dog yeah that's what
you're saying yeah so I'll just I'll

124
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:00,990
you're saying yeah so I'll just I'll
 

125
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,200
you're saying yeah so I'll just I'll
stick to the electronics yeah yeah we

126
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,210
stick to the electronics yeah yeah we
 

127
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,790
stick to the electronics yeah yeah we
don't we don't have to keep harping on

128
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
don't we don't have to keep harping on
 

129
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,780
don't we don't have to keep harping on
that pre de yeah the diodes look good

130
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:08,790
that pre de yeah the diodes look good
 

131
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,970
that pre de yeah the diodes look good
and it was seven bucks for five so so

132
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:10,980
and it was seven bucks for five so so
 

133
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,530
and it was seven bucks for five so so
that means so the reason I got a five

134
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:12,540
that means so the reason I got a five
 

135
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,690
that means so the reason I got a five
pack is because I'm gonna use two for

136
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:14,700
pack is because I'm gonna use two for
 

137
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,010
pack is because I'm gonna use two for
the dual redundancy on the single board

138
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,020
the dual redundancy on the single board
 

139
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,200
the dual redundancy on the single board
computers and two for the dual redundant

140
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,210
computers and two for the dual redundant
 

141
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,360
computers and two for the dual redundant
see it on my server in the colocation

142
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,370
see it on my server in the colocation
 

143
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,090

facility and three more spare in case
 

145
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:46,060
facility and three more spare in case
you blow them up cuz I can that's why

146
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,070

 

147
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:57,670

you were saying for your server I was at

148
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680

 

149
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,440

my car was having a ticket today for

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,450
my car was having a ticket today for
 

151
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,770
my car was having a ticket today for
your checking the brakes and while I was

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:06,780
your checking the brakes and while I was
 

153
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,510
your checking the brakes and while I was
waiting and there is some local

waiting and there is some local
 

155
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,060
waiting and there is some local

to know what else you could do you could

428
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:57,639
to know what else you could do you could
 

429
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,129
to know what else you could do you could
you could get a das and connect that to

430
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:02,139
you could get a das and connect that to
 

431
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,889
you could get a das and connect that to
like if it has USB 3 or maybe put a

432
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:04,899
like if it has USB 3 or maybe put a
 

433
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,169
like if it has USB 3 or maybe put a
eSATA card in it and then access it or

434
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:09,179
eSATA card in it and then access it or
 

435
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,340
eSATA card in it and then access it or
though if you were going to put an eSATA

436
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,350
though if you were going to put an eSATA
 

437
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,929
though if you were going to put an eSATA
card and you could use that probably for

438
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:12,939
card and you could use that probably for
 

439
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:17,100
card and you could use that probably for
an internal SATA as well I'm just

440
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,110
an internal SATA as well I'm just
 

441

yeah so my plan is to I'm gonna use some
a year or so to and get a few drives and

468
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:09,759
a year or so to and get a few drives and
 

469
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,230
a year or so to and get a few drives and
their protein there and set up our raid

470
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:13,240
their protein there and set up our raid
 

471
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,700
their protein there and set up our raid
6 I think

472
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:14,710
6 I think
 

473
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,080
6 I think
yeah so what would be a would they take

474
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,090
yeah so what would be a would they take
 

475
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,830
yeah so what would be a would they take
control of the driver externally will be

476
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:23,840
control of the driver externally will be
 

477
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,650
control of the driver externally will be
at sour than the one enjoyed the one on

478
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:26,660
at sour than the one enjoyed the one on
 

479
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,250
at sour than the one enjoyed the one on
the boat at the adults file wouldn't it

480
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,260
the boat at the adults file wouldn't it
 

481
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,660
the boat at the adults file wouldn't it
well you could use like a PCI Express

482
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:31,670
well you could use like a PCI Express
 

483
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,540
well you could use like a PCI Express
card that would be doing it fast six gig

484
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:34,550
card that would be doing it fast six gig
 

485
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:41,830
card that would be doing it fast six gig
would it take a second yeah yeah oh yeah

486
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:41,840
would it take a second yeah yeah oh yeah
 

487
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,740
would it take a second yeah yeah oh yeah
six gig a second for you for an IAT a3

488
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:44,750
six gig a second for you for an IAT a3
 

489
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,650
six gig a second for you for an IAT a3
yeah yeah and according to a few pages

490
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:47,660
yeah yeah and according to a few pages
 

491
00:13:47,660 --> 00:14:22,360
yeah yeah and according to a few pages
I've been checking turn off then it can

492
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,370
I've been checking turn off then it can
 

493
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,490
I've been checking turn off then it can
use all drive say independently but then

494
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:24,500
use all drive say independently but then
 

495
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,950
use all drive say independently but then
it can't from any of them so but at the

496
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:26,960
it can't from any of them so but at the
 

497
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,230
it can't from any of them so but at the
you're going in the wrong direction

498
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
you're going in the wrong direction
 

499
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,180
you're going in the wrong direction
don't remove redundant yeah but have

500
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,190
don't remove redundant yeah but have
 

501
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:46,710
don't remove redundant yeah but have
redundancy yeah but oh my goodness so

502
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720

 

503
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,260

software Oh Serio j-bot you're gonna do

504
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,270
software Oh Serio j-bot you're gonna do
 

505
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,840
software Oh Serio j-bot you're gonna do
a j-bot setup and then use linux to do

506
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:52,850
a j-bot setup and then use linux to do
 

507
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,700
a j-bot setup and then use linux to do
the software raid instead yeah because

508
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:54,710
the software raid instead yeah because
 

509
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,230
the software raid instead yeah because
if something happened to you they

510
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
if something happened to you they
 

511
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,490
if something happened to you they
haven't read the books and I have to

512
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:57,500
haven't read the books and I have to
 

513
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,160
haven't read the books and I have to
yeah replace it then I have to I want to

514
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,170
yeah replace it then I have to I want to
 

515
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,170
yeah replace it then I have to I want to
take my my drives and then yeah here

516
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,180
take my my drives and then yeah here
 

517
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,690
take my my drives and then yeah here
yeah that what I what I would see is the

518
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:07,700
yeah that what I what I would see is the
 

519
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,880
yeah that what I what I would see is the
the reason I wouldn't go that approach

520
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:09,890
the reason I wouldn't go that approach
 

521
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,920
the reason I wouldn't go that approach
personally is because then you're losing

522
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:11,930
personally is because then you're losing
 

523
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,530
personally is because then you're losing
your controllers capabilities to notify

524
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:14,540
your controllers capabilities to notify
 

525
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,320
your controllers capabilities to notify
you if a drive was failing or failed so

526
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,330
you if a drive was failing or failed so
 

527
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,540
you if a drive was failing or failed so
if you have because your controller

528
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:19,550
if you have because your controller
 

529
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,370
if you have because your controller
right now the built-in RAID controller

530
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:21,380
right now the built-in RAID controller
 

531
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,530
right now the built-in RAID controller
if one of those drives is going wonky it

532
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:23,540
if one of those drives is going wonky it
 

533
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,590
if one of those drives is going wonky it
will let you know and so the silver LEDs

534
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:26,600
will let you know and so the silver LEDs
 

535
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,570
will let you know and so the silver LEDs
yeah

536
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:27,580
yeah
 

537
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,080
yeah
MDA this is immune Linux it couldn't

538
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,090
MDA this is immune Linux it couldn't
 

539
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,060

save your nails yeah if you can but only

540
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,070
save your nails yeah if you can but only
 

541
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,310
save your nails yeah if you can but only
through software rather than visual like

542
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:35,320
through software rather than visual like
 

543
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,650
through software rather than visual like
that might be depending on the smart or

544
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:37,660
that might be depending on the smart or
 

545
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,600
that might be depending on the smart or
something like that to tell ya going bad

546
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:39,610
something like that to tell ya going bad
 

547
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,100
something like that to tell ya going bad
right yeah

548
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,110
right yeah
 

549
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,230
right yeah
whereas with the controller on your on

550
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,240
whereas with the controller on your on
 

551
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,330
whereas with the controller on your on
your like it's part of the backplane

552
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:45,340
your like it's part of the backplane
 

553
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,640
your like it's part of the backplane
right so that's going to notify you

554
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:47,650
right so that's going to notify you
 

555
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,620
right so that's going to notify you
visually like with an amber light or a

556
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:49,630
visually like with an amber light or a
 

557
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,570
visually like with an amber light or a
flashing light so I don't like the I

558
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:51,580
flashing light so I don't like the I
 

559
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,390
flashing light so I don't like the I
don't like that in order to be there if

560
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:54,400
don't like that in order to be there if
 

561
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,620
don't like that in order to be there if
I have to insert a few new two motor

562
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,630
I have to insert a few new two motor
 

563
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,280
I have to insert a few new two motor
drives in in a few months and I don't

564
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,290
drives in in a few months and I don't
 

565
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,740
drives in in a few months and I don't
like then I have to shut down the system

566
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:04,750
like then I have to shut down the system
 

567
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,630
like then I have to shut down the system
in order to get it to the power your son

568
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:06,640
in order to get it to the power your son
 

569
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,600
in order to get it to the power your son
yeah I don't you're gonna do an LP em

570
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,610
yeah I don't you're gonna do an LP em
 

571
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:20,520
yeah I don't you're gonna do an LP em
yeah certainly gives you a flexibility

572
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,530
yeah certainly gives you a flexibility
 

573
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:30,420
yeah certainly gives you a flexibility
that way yeah cool man Eric have that is

574
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:30,430
that way yeah cool man Eric have that is
 

575
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,280
that way yeah cool man Eric have that is
in a big data center we have four drives

576
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,290
in a big data center we have four drives
 

577
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:43,980
in a big data center we have four drives
of tutor but each in raid 0 so what what

578
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:43,990
of tutor but each in raid 0 so what what
 

579
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,510
of tutor but each in raid 0 so what what
else are you using a server for you're

580
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:45,520
else are you using a server for you're
 

581
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,100
else are you using a server for you're
gonna be running software on it or is it

582
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,110
gonna be running software on it or is it
 

583
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,940
gonna be running software on it or is it
just a file server I also I want to

584
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:52,950
just a file server I also I want to
 

585
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,110
just a file server I also I want to
offload a few of my VMs really powerful

586
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,120
offload a few of my VMs really powerful
 

587
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,540
offload a few of my VMs really powerful
oh yeah so I can have a few that vmstat

588
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:03,550
oh yeah so I can have a few that vmstat
 

589
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,870
oh yeah so I can have a few that vmstat
is not reliant on my desktop it being

590
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
is not reliant on my desktop it being
 

591
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,610
is not reliant on my desktop it being
available yeah yeah that would be good

592
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:11,620
available yeah yeah that would be good
 

593
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,350
available yeah yeah that would be good
I'd be real good and then get yourself a

594
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
I'd be real good and then get yourself a
 

595
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,920
I'd be real good and then get yourself a
good UPS yeah that is the next step I

596
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:16,930
good UPS yeah that is the next step I
 

597
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,860
good UPS yeah that is the next step I
have a UPS for the desktop scissors in

598
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:19,870
have a UPS for the desktop scissors in
 

599
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,870
have a UPS for the desktop scissors in
my living room but I plan to get one for

600
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:21,880
my living room but I plan to get one for
 

601
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,660
my living room but I plan to get one for
the two systems those there's cool I was

602
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:27,670
the two systems those there's cool I was
 

603
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,130
the two systems those there's cool I was
thinking I might you guys know I'm

604
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,140
thinking I might you guys know I'm
 

605
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,410
thinking I might you guys know I'm
dreaming now about having because I did

606
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:31,420
dreaming now about having because I did
 

607
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
dreaming now about having because I did
the show on trying to reduce the noise

608
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,430
the show on trying to reduce the noise
 

609
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,190
the show on trying to reduce the noise
in the server room and my server is

610
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
in the server room and my server is
 

611
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,890
in the server room and my server is
still that our five ten still sounds

612
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:37,900
still that our five ten still sounds
 

613
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,500
still that our five ten still sounds
like a it sounds like your Cessna

614

from power I get there so so what I'm
 

647
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,790

650
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:49,720
file server that I used to use at home
 

651
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,750

before I before I upgraded my home

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
before I before I upgraded my home
 

653
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,330

server I'm wondering if I could take

654
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,340
server I'm wondering if I could take
 

655
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,830
server I'm wondering if I could take
that in because it's just because it's

656
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
that in because it's just because it's
 

657
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,630
that in because it's just because it's
just a low powered system I'm thinking

658
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:57,640
just a low powered system I'm thinking
 

659
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,160
just a low powered system I'm thinking
along the lines of I really only need it

660
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,170
along the lines of I really only need it
 

661
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,490
along the lines of I really only need it
to be a file server maybe I could put

662
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:02,500
to be a file server maybe I could put
 

663
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,140
to be a file server maybe I could put
together something kind of cheap and

664
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,150
together something kind of cheap and
 

665
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,900
together something kind of cheap and
cheerful to I'm thinking the same things

666
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:06,910
cheerful to I'm thinking the same things
 

667
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,550
cheerful to I'm thinking the same things
when we were talking about going through

668
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:08,560
when we were talking about going through
 

669
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,520
when we were talking about going through
yesterday and you know web servers and

670
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,530
yesterday and you know web servers and
 

671
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,640
yesterday and you know web servers and
all that it would be pretty trivial to

672
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:14,650
all that it would be pretty trivial to
 

673
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,190
all that it would be pretty trivial to
put them to stick a Raspberry Pi on you

674
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,200
put them to stick a Raspberry Pi on you
 

675
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,070
put them to stick a Raspberry Pi on you
just on your network and just internal

676
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
just on your network and just internal
 

677
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,000
just on your network and just internal
writing no just internal yeah yeah yeah

678
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,010
writing no just internal yeah yeah yeah
 

679
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,370
writing no just internal yeah yeah yeah
but but what if remember I started a

680
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:26,380
but but what if remember I started a
 

681
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,310
but but what if remember I started a
feature on the dash unit with a no droid

682
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:29,320
feature on the dash unit with a no droid
 

683
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,890

xu4 yeah yeah yeah and the reason I to

684
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:31,900
xu4 yeah yeah yeah and the reason I to
 

685
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,520
xu4 yeah yeah yeah and the reason I to
the reason that I chose the xu4 queue as

686
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,530
the reason that I chose the xu4 queue as
 

687
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,590
the reason that I chose the xu4 queue as
opposed to a Raspberry Pi is because it

688
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
opposed to a Raspberry Pi is because it
 

689
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,700
opposed to a Raspberry Pi is because it
supports UAS so USB Attached scuzzy

690
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:41,710
supports UAS so USB Attached scuzzy
 

691
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,340
supports UAS so USB Attached scuzzy
which is a protocol that allows you to

692
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,350
which is a protocol that allows you to
 

693
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,410
which is a protocol that allows you to
get three gigabits a second off of the

694
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:46,420
get three gigabits a second off of the
 

695
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,490
get three gigabits a second off of the
USB 3 bus on an SATA controller Wow yeah

696
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:50,500
USB 3 bus on an SATA controller Wow yeah
 

697
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,620
USB 3 bus on an SATA controller Wow yeah
yeah but do you need that kind of speed

698
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:52,630
yeah but do you need that kind of speed
 

699
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,260
yeah but do you need that kind of speed
so

700
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,270
so
 

701
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,860
so
relax for a web service oh I'm thinking

702
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:58,870
relax for a web service oh I'm thinking
 

703
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,960
relax for a web service oh I'm thinking
more for in-house file storage

704
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:00,970
more for in-house file storage
 

705
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,720
more for in-house file storage
ah when because I do a 4k video

706
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:03,730
ah when because I do a 4k video
 

707
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,610
ah when because I do a 4k video
production yeah I need I need a fair bit

708
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:05,620
production yeah I need I need a fair bit
 

709
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,010
production yeah I need I need a fair bit
of speed but I wonder if I if I well

710
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,020
of speed but I wonder if I if I well
 

711
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,350
of speed but I wonder if I if I well
when I finish that series maybe I should

712
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:10,360
when I finish that series maybe I should
 

713
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,710
when I finish that series maybe I should
use in that unit because it's just it's

714
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:13,720
use in that unit because it's just it's
 

715
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,840
use in that unit because it's just it's
just got what five drives in it and I

716
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:15,850
just got what five drives in it and I
 

717
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,830
just got what five drives in it and I
can just repaired it off of silent xu4 I

718
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
can just repaired it off of silent xu4 I
 

719
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,360
can just repaired it off of silent xu4 I
do need to have virtual appliances

720
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,370
do need to have virtual appliances

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,230
I've made this observation before with
 

729
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,110
I've made this observation before with
single board computers is that the
