00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:16,459
climate-controlled room that I had
 

623
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:22,150
climate-controlled room that I had
access to so then then several years

624
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
access to so then then several years
 

625
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,079
access to so then then several years
later somebody contacted me and offered

626
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,089
later somebody contacted me and offered
 

627
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:31,299
later somebody contacted me and offered
to donate colocation facility I have one

628
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:31,309
to donate colocation facility I have one
 

629
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,879
to donate colocation facility I have one
you at the colocation facility for free

630
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:33,889
you at the colocation facility for free
 

631
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,879
you at the colocation facility for free
so they they actually donate that to me

632
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:36,889
so they they actually donate that to me
 

633
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:37,869
so they they actually donate that to me
so it was a no-brainer

634
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:37,879
so it was a no-brainer
 

635
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,509
so it was a no-brainer
okay I'm gonna I'm going to turn off the

636
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:40,519
okay I'm gonna I'm going to turn off the
 

637
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,429
okay I'm gonna I'm going to turn off the
server that I'm paying $600 a month to

638
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:42,439
server that I'm paying $600 a month to
 

639
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:46,179
server that I'm paying $600 a month to
run sure and switch to the so I have one

640
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:46,189
run sure and switch to the so I have one
 

641
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:47,829
run sure and switch to the so I have one
U of space in the server rack so I'm

642
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
U of space in the server rack so I'm
 

643
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,829
U of space in the server rack so I'm
actually using this little what's called

644
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:50,839
actually using this little what's called
 

645
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:53,530
actually using this little what's called
a fit lit - it's like a single board

646
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:53,540
a fit lit - it's like a single board
 

647
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,600
a fit lit - it's like a single board
computer type device and but it so it

648
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:58,610
computer type device and but it so it
 

649
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,280
computer type device and but it so it
only uses one you have space in the rack

650
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,290
only uses one you have space in the rack
 

651
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,040
only uses one you have space in the rack
but unfortunately it has a lot of single

652
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,050
but unfortunately it has a lot of single
 

653
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,710
but unfortunately it has a lot of single
points of failure as well but reliable

654
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:05,720
points of failure as well but reliable
 

655
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,859
points of failure as well but reliable
yeah and and so that would be something

656
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:08,869
yeah and and so that would be something
 

657
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,139
yeah and and so that would be something
that would be something work so the

658
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:11,149
that would be something work so the
 

659
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:16,509
that would be something work so the
first question is that server the actual

660
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:16,519
first question is that server the actual
 

661
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,239
first question is that server the actual
machine and the big bad Internet are

662
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,249
machine and the big bad Internet are
 

663
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,980
machine and the big bad Internet are
there other references or anything

664
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:20,990
there other references or anything
 

665
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,439
there other references or anything
protecting you there or you expected to

666
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:23,449
protecting you there or you expected to
 

667
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,269
protecting you there or you expected to
harden your server yeah it's it's on its

668
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:28,279
harden your server yeah it's it's on its
 

669
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,059
harden your server yeah it's it's on its
own IP okay so it just passes through

670
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:31,069
own IP okay so it just passes through
 

671
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:34,419
own IP okay so it just passes through
their firewall it gets filtered from

672
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:34,429
their firewall it gets filtered from
 

673
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:39,429
their firewall it gets filtered from
things like DDoS and and like they have

674
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:39,439
things like DDoS and and like they have
 

675
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,889
things like DDoS and and like they have
attack mitigation on the on the network

676
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:41,899
attack mitigation on the on the network
 

677
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:45,489
attack mitigation on the on the network
but the server itself so in order to get

678
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:45,499
but the server itself so in order to get
 

679
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,460
but the server itself so in order to get
to the server goes through clouds layer

680
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,470
to the server goes through clouds layer
 

681
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,079
to the server goes through clouds layer
so clouds layer does all the DNS routing

682
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:50,089
so clouds layer does all the DNS routing
 

683
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,360
so clouds layer does all the DNS routing
and and takes care of attack mitigation

684
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,370
and and takes care of attack mitigation
 

685
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,780
and and takes care of attack mitigation
and and proxy and so when you're looking

686
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:55,790
and and proxy and so when you're looking
 

687
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,910
and and proxy and so when you're looking
at the site on that server you're not

688
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
at the site on that server you're not
 

689
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,559
at the site on that server you're not
actually looking at the site on that

690
00:16:59,559 --> 00:16:59,569
actually looking at the site on that
 

691
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,569
actually looking at the site on that
server you're looking at what CloudFlare

692
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:01,579
server you're looking at what CloudFlare
 

693
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:02,860
server you're looking at what CloudFlare
is serving up through their cache

694
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:02,870
is serving up through their cache
 

695
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,389
is serving up through their cache
servers so so the the communication

696
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:07,399
servers so so the the communication
 

697
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,909
servers so so the the communication
between my server and the internet

698
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
between my server and the internet
 

699
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,620
between my server and the internet
happens between my server and cloud

700
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:11,630
happens between my server and cloud
 

701
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,889
happens between my server and cloud
player so so that's I thought I thought

702
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:17,899
player so so that's I thought I thought
 

703
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,329
player so so that's I thought I thought
we might have lost him he was like

704
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:19,339
we might have lost him he was like
 

705
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,720
we might have lost him he was like
holding very still so I don't know how

706
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:22,730
holding very still so I don't know how
 

707
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,579
holding very still so I don't know how
much of that is

708
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:23,589
much of that is
 

709
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,929
much of that is
you got but he'll watch it back I'm sure

710
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:26,939
you got but he'll watch it back I'm sure
 

711
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,630
you got but he'll watch it back I'm sure
cloud players is what does a lot of the

712
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
cloud players is what does a lot of the
 

713
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,669
cloud players is what does a lot of the
protection but then I have CSF lfd on

714
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:32,679
protection but then I have CSF lfd on
 

715
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,950
protection but then I have CSF lfd on
the server as well so if anyone passes

716
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
the server as well so if anyone passes
 

717
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,880
the server as well so if anyone passes
through the the CloudFlare service or

718
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:38,890
through the the CloudFlare service or
 

719
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,039
through the the CloudFlare service or
points to say my IP address directly

720
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,049
points to say my IP address directly
 

721
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,200
points to say my IP address directly
then I have an added level of protection

722
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,210
then I have an added level of protection
 

723
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,840
then I have an added level of protection
and I don't play any games it's like if

724
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:45,850
and I don't play any games it's like if
 

725
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,140
and I don't play any games it's like if
you if you try to log into SSH once you

726
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,150
you if you try to log into SSH once you
 

727
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,269
you if you try to log into SSH once you
are banned your IP address is blocked if

728
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:51,279
are banned your IP address is blocked if
 

729
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,210
are banned your IP address is blocked if
you do a port scan once you are blocked

730
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,220
you do a port scan once you are blocked
 

731
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:01,279
you do a port scan once you are blocked
so don't do those things he's back yeah

732
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,289
so don't do those things he's back yeah

time my Ethernet seems to be flaky is
 

743
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,430
time my Ethernet seems to be flaky is
during the coffee break

744
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,440
during the coffee break
 

745
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,350
