I actually mounted Hardware firewall
 

159
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,050
I actually mounted Hardware firewall
inside the chassis so the ethernet was

160
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,060
inside the chassis so the ethernet was
 

161
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,960
inside the chassis so the ethernet was
plugged into like a just a dongle

162
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:51,970
plugged into like a just a dongle
 

163
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,030
plugged into like a just a dongle
hanging out the back like a keystone

164
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,040
hanging out the back like a keystone
 

165
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,910
hanging out the back like a keystone
jack and then that went into the into

166
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:56,920
jack and then that went into the into
 

167
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,950
jack and then that went into the into
the firewall and then that went to the

168
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
the firewall and then that went to the
 

169
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,980
the firewall and then that went to the
motherboards so you mounted the firewall

170
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:01,990
motherboards so you mounted the firewall
 

171
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,600
motherboards so you mounted the firewall
device inside the for you guys tape to

172
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,610
device inside the for you guys tape to
 

173
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,650
device inside the for you guys tape to
the lid oh yeah whatever that works it

174
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:10,660
the lid oh yeah whatever that works it
 

175
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,710
the lid oh yeah whatever that works it
works real well all right for years that

176
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
works real well all right for years that
 

177
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,350
works real well all right for years that
to us server and that old server and I

178
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
to us server and that old server and I
 

179
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,380
to us server and that old server and I
looked it up a few weeks ago and their

180
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,390
looked it up a few weeks ago and their
 

181
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,710
looked it up a few weeks ago and their
BIOS for that server was from 2000 to

182
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
BIOS for that server was from 2000 to
 

183
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,830
BIOS for that server was from 2000 to
2004 so we had that running back at 9:00

184
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
2004 so we had that running back at 9:00
 

185
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:40,880
2004 so we had that running back at 9:00
6:00 until 2016 and it was it was a

186
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:40,890

 

187
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,180

configure it and he wrote the a he had

188
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,190
configure it and he wrote the a he had
 

189
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,960
configure it and he wrote the a he had
eight hours on the bus with the Machine

190
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:48,970
eight hours on the bus with the Machine
 

191
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,550
eight hours on the bus with the Machine
going to the data center plug it in and

192
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
going to the data center plug it in and
 

193
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:03,090
going to the data center plug it in and
it was it was a desktop system he was he

194
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,100
it was it was a desktop system he was he
 

195
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:09,480
it was it was a desktop system he was he
got a deal on a 2-u chassis also he

196
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,490
got a deal on a 2-u chassis also he
 

197
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,300
got a deal on a 2-u chassis also he
adapted it into the problem is that

198
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,310
adapted it into the problem is that
 

199
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,310
adapted it into the problem is that
there DM

201
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,270

yeah peep-peep PCI cards that VJ cards

202
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,280
yeah peep-peep PCI cards that VJ cards
 

203
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,340
yeah peep-peep PCI cards that VJ cards
they are you need a for you chassis in

204
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,350
they are you need a for you chassis in
 

205
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,750
they are you need a for you chassis in
order to monteux's right yeah we had to

206
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:31,760
order to monteux's right yeah we had to
 

207
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,700
order to monteux's right yeah we had to
you Jesse be there for you BJ cord

208
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:36,710
you Jesse be there for you BJ cord
 

209
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,430
you Jesse be there for you BJ cord
plugged into that yeah yeah so our

210
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
plugged into that yeah yeah so our
 

211
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,140
plugged into that yeah yeah so our
friend of ours who lived in that area he

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
took this it was just in a few months
 

215
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,640
took this it was just in a few months
first month was the setting is set in

216
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:48,650
first month was the setting is set in
 

217
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,710
first month was the setting is set in
grabs it was nothing important on it yet

218
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
grabs it was nothing important on it yet

so he had took this our home and during

220
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:53,480
so he had took this our home and during
 

221
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,930
so he had took this our home and during
the weekend he had the PCI card itself

222
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:58,940
the weekend he had the PCI card itself
 

223
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,680
the weekend he had the PCI card itself
if you find in a chewy chassis so the

224
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:02,690
if you find in a chewy chassis so the
 

225
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,830
if you find in a chewy chassis so the
and added a metal bar that he to find it

226
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:08,840
and added a metal bar that he to find it
 

227
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:18,910
and added a metal bar that he to find it
around the backplane yeah what I was

228
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:18,920
around the backplane yeah what I was
 

229
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
around the backplane yeah what I was
never going to leave that service and

230
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:20,930
never going to leave that service and
 

231
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,960
never going to leave that service and
know what I would do in a case like that

232
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:22,970
know what I would do in a case like that
 

233
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,550
know what I would do in a case like that
you can buy PCI Express extenders so you

234
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:27,560
you can buy PCI Express extenders so you
 

235
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,610
you can buy PCI Express extenders so you
can actually get like you plug it into

236
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:30,620
can actually get like you plug it into
 

237
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,160
can actually get like you plug it into
the PCI Express and then it has a cable

238
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,170
the PCI Express and then it has a cable
 

239
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,740
the PCI Express and then it has a cable
which is usually like a USB 3 cable and

240
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:35,750
which is usually like a USB 3 cable and
 

241
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,450
which is usually like a USB 3 cable and
then you can just mount the card

242
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:37,460
then you can just mount the card
 

243
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:45,940
then you can just mount the card
anywhere within about six inches and you

244
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:45,950
anywhere within about six inches and you
 

245
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:55,350
anywhere within about six inches and you
know that you can do that in order to

246
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360

 

247
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,320

deep thoughts you have to know you can

248
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,330
deep thoughts you have to know you can
 

249
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,200
deep thoughts you have to know you can
do it to have the idea of doing it I

250
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,210
do it to have the idea of doing it I
 

251
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,000
do it to have the idea of doing it I
just think it's funny that your row that

252
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,010
just think it's funny that your row that
 

253
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,850
just think it's funny that your row that

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm not sure how the public transport
 

261
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm not sure how the public transport
system is in Canada rugby but the public

262
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:21,650
system is in Canada rugby but the public
 

263
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,740
system is in Canada rugby but the public
transport system basically doesn't exist

big cities really like New York and Los
 

269
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,970
big cities really like New York and Los
