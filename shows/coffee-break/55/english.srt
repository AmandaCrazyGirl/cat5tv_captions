phone well here's another problem and

476
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,250
phone well here's another problem and
 

477
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,600
phone well here's another problem and
that problem is that recording stuff

that problem is that recording stuff
 

479
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,590

for B card is it's not clear on how you
should store that date I mean for

488
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,410

491
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,230

has the specific stream right I think it

492
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
has the specific stream right I think it
 

493
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,890
has the specific stream right I think it
might be birthday last name first name L

yeah it's entirely parts
 

619
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,750
yeah it's entirely parts
yeah I do think the standard says if you

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:50,760
yeah I do think the standard says if you
 

621
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,130
yeah I do think the standard says if you
want to write custom attributes use X -

622
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,140
want to write custom attributes use X -
 

623
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,250
want to write custom attributes use X -
something but it doesn't say anymore

624

what you know it doesn't declare any
further what that attribute should

628
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,150
further what that attribute should
 

629
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:08,600
further what that attribute should
should define but I was going to ask you

630
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:08,610
