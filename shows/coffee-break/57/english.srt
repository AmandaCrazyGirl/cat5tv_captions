be a lot of bandwidth yeah and no doubt

248
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,300
be a lot of bandwidth yeah and no doubt
 

249
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,640
be a lot of bandwidth yeah and no doubt
they've got some sophisticated

250
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,650
they've got some sophisticated
 

251
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,220
they've got some sophisticated
throttling in place that makes sure that

252
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,230
throttling in place that makes sure that
 

253
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,960
throttling in place that makes sure that
hey if we're not able to keep up with

hey if we're not able to keep up with
 

255
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,750
hey if we're not able to keep up with
the bandwidth turn down the quality dish

256
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:57,760
the bandwidth turn down the quality dish
 

257
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,430
the bandwidth turn down the quality dish
make sense so I'm thinking about I'm

639
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,250
point to your piehole but you shouldn't
have to go to that trouble am I right

640
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,260
have to go to that trouble am I right
 

641
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,150
have to go to that trouble am I right
yes so so Mike my problem with it was

642
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
yes so so Mike my problem with it was
 

643
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,290
yes so so Mike my problem with it was
that you know I set up a safe filtered

644
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:08,300
that you know I set up a safe filtered
 

645
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,200
that you know I set up a safe filtered

647
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,090
Network at home to keep my kids safe to
keep things off you had a network that

648
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,100
keep things off you had a network that
 

649
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,550
keep things off you had a network that
we don't want and so I just thought it

650
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:15,560
we don't want and so I just thought it
 

651
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,570
we don't want and so I just thought it
would really uncool that yeah I just

652
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:19,580
would really uncool that yeah I just
 

653
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,280
would really uncool that yeah I just
wanted to clarify one thing though

654
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,290
wanted to clarify one thing though
 

655
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,530
wanted to clarify one thing though
Robbie was the backlash that you got

656
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:23,540
Robbie was the backlash that you got
 

657
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,400
Robbie was the backlash that you got
because of DNS over HTTP or because of

658
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,410
because of DNS over HTTP or because of
 

659
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,110
because of DNS over HTTP or because of
Firefox deciding what would be an issue

660
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,120
Firefox deciding what would be an issue
 

661
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,090
Firefox deciding what would be an issue
should use yeah they disagreed with me

662
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,100
should use yeah they disagreed with me
 

663
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,560
should use yeah they disagreed with me
on that point that point especially on

664
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,570
on that point that point especially on
 

665
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:44,050
on that point that point especially on
which Firefox's choice to enforce their

666
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,060
which Firefox's choice to enforce their
 

667
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,150
which Firefox's choice to enforce their
own but they were but they were okay

668
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
own but they were but they were okay
 

669
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,260
own but they were but they were okay
with DNS overage

670
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,270
with DNS overage
 

671
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,500
with DNS overage
of course yeah yeah is there reason for

672
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,510
of course yeah yeah is there reason for
 

673
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,730
of course yeah yeah is there reason for
doing that for cyber HTTP what is there

674
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:54,740
doing that for cyber HTTP what is there
 

675
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,520
doing that for cyber HTTP what is there
what is Firefox is reason for enforcing

676
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:57,530
what is Firefox is reason for enforcing
 

677
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,130
what is Firefox is reason for enforcing
their own DNS hide your DNS requests

678
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,140
their own DNS hide your DNS requests
 

679
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,300
their own DNS hide your DNS requests
from your ISP privacy but that's over

680
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,310
from your ISP privacy but that's over
 

681
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,120
from your ISP privacy but that's over
HTTP yes does the same thing so what

682
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,130
HTTP yes does the same thing so what
 

683
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,110
HTTP yes does the same thing so what
happens if you use tor well they they

684
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
happens if you use tor well they they
 

685
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,010
happens if you use tor well they they
can't trace that presumably well never

686
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,020
can't trace that presumably well never
 

687
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,920
can't trace that presumably well never
the question is what what DNS does to

688
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:17,930
the question is what what DNS does to
 

689
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,040
the question is what what DNS does to
use tor is based on Firefox presumably

690
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,050
use tor is based on Firefox presumably
 

691
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,400
use tor is based on Firefox presumably
an earlier version of Firefox and I'd be

692
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,410
an earlier version of Firefox and I'd be
 

693
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,820
an earlier version of Firefox and I'd be
because Firefox is open source I bet you

694
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:27,830
because Firefox is open source I bet you
 

695
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,130
because Firefox is open source I bet you
that tour just disables that piece of

696
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,140
that tour just disables that piece of
 

697
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,320
that tour just disables that piece of
Firefox but all these are distributed

698
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,330
Firefox but all these are distributed
 

699
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,050
Firefox but all these are distributed
right it's not it's not that it's hidden

700
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,060
right it's not it's not that it's hidden
 

701
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,230
right it's not it's not that it's hidden
it's that it's obscured but you still

702
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,240
it's that it's obscured but you still
 

703
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,120
it's that it's obscured but you still
have to use a Danish to locate the other

704
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,130
have to use a Danish to locate the other
 

705
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,460
have to use a Danish to locate the other
nodes yeah yeah I always thought that

706
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,470
nodes yeah yeah I always thought that
 

707
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,490
nodes yeah yeah I always thought that
tor used a random DNS that's why you

708
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:48,500
tor used a random DNS that's why you
 

709
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,190
tor used a random DNS that's why you
look like you could be in Germany when

710
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
look like you could be in Germany when
 

711
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,780
look like you could be in Germany when
you were in the u.s. yeah but which day

712
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:55,790
you were in the u.s. yeah but which day
 

713
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,310
you were in the u.s. yeah but which day
an issue use doesn't determine that

714
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,320
an issue use doesn't determine that
 

715
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,370
an issue use doesn't determine that
which node you end up pointing to or

716
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:02,380
which node you end up pointing to or
 

717
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,290
which node you end up pointing to or
directing your your traffic through is

718
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:05,300
directing your your traffic through is
 

719
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,830
directing your your traffic through is
the node debt that it looks like you're

720
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:08,840
the node debt that it looks like you're
 

721
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,130
the node debt that it looks like you're
from so tor will go you know will direct

722
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,140
from so tor will go you know will direct
 

723
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,260
from so tor will go you know will direct
your request through like half a dozen

724
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,270
your request through like half a dozen
 

725
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,210
your request through like half a dozen
if it's configured that way

726
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,220
if it's configured that way
 

727
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,060
if it's configured that way
couple dozen different nodes and if

728
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,070
couple dozen different nodes and if
 

729
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,720
couple dozen different nodes and if
somebody tries to trace that node out of

730
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:22,730
somebody tries to trace that node out of
 

731
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,430
somebody tries to trace that node out of
Germany for instance they'll probably

732
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:24,440
Germany for instance they'll probably
 

733
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,380
Germany for instance they'll probably
end up in in in in Australia somewhere

734
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,390
end up in in in in Australia somewhere
 

735
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,780
end up in in in in Australia somewhere
and then and then from Australia if they

736
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:31,790
and then and then from Australia if they
 

737
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,340
and then and then from Australia if they
try to follow that they'll end up in

738
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,350
try to follow that they'll end up in
 

739
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,030
try to follow that they'll end up in
that in Hong Kong and if they go to Hong

740
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,040
that in Hong Kong and if they go to Hong
 

741
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,540
that in Hong Kong and if they go to Hong
Kong

742
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:37,550
Kong
 

743
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,860
Kong
you know if they trace it back as far as

744
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:38,870
you know if they trace it back as far as
 

745
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,620
you know if they trace it back as far as
Hong Kong they'll finally go back to you

746
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,630
Hong Kong they'll finally go back to you
 

747
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,670
Hong Kong they'll finally go back to you
know they'll end up over in England

748
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:42,680
know they'll end up over in England
 

749
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,000
know they'll end up over in England
somewhere and then they go back to the

750
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,010
somewhere and then they go back to the
 

751
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,160
somewhere and then they go back to the
US well if they're able to trace it back

752
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,170
US well if they're able to trace it back
 

753
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,580
US well if they're able to trace it back
that far yes yes well I'm on everybody

754
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:51,590
that far yes yes well I'm on everybody
 

755
