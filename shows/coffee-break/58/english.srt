do the paperback and everything else so
so I'm curious about the technical

232
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,580
so I'm curious about the technical
 

233
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,280
so I'm curious about the technical
aspect of it can we talk about that a

234
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,290
aspect of it can we talk about that a
 

235
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,660
aspect of it can we talk about that a
little bit here so when Becca writes a

little bit here so when Becca writes a
manuscript what does she typically use

238
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:51,650

276
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:47,720
loose print like you'd like the pages
 

277
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,030
loose print like you'd like the pages
were numbered but we've never done that

278
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,040
were numbered but we've never done that
 

279
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,580
were numbered but we've never done that
we always find it so anyways that that's

280
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,590
we always find it so anyways that that's
 

281
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,270
we always find it so anyways that that's
locally done and then once the editing

282
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
locally done and then once the editing
 

283
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,410
locally done and then once the editing
is done it's all done in libreoffice

284
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:58,420
is done it's all done in libreoffice
 

285
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,720
is done it's all done in libreoffice
then I put together the formatted PDF

286
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:01,730
then I put together the formatted PDF
 

287
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:06,130
then I put together the formatted PDF
file also in libreoffice so and then

288
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,140
file also in libreoffice so and then
 

289
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,280
file also in libreoffice so and then
send it off to the printers we usually

290
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,290
send it off to the printers we usually
 

291
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,930
send it off to the printers we usually
start with a couple of like a small run

292
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:10,940
start with a couple of like a small run
 

293
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,750
start with a couple of like a small run
just to make sure that the formatting

294
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:13,760
just to make sure that the formatting
 

295
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,650
just to make sure that the formatting
comes out okay

296
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:14,660
comes out okay
 

297
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,650

300
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:21,940
and I use the [ __ ] for that mm-hmm so
 

301
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,820
and I use the [ __ ] for that mm-hmm so
yeah it's kind of neat so the printer

302
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:24,830
yeah it's kind of neat so the printer
 

303
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,510
yeah it's kind of neat so the printer
expects of PDF thing in order to try to

304
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,520
expects of PDF thing in order to try to
 

305
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,210
expects of PDF thing in order to try to
find that I find that's the easiest way

306
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:31,220
find that I find that's the easiest way
 

307
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,930
find that I find that's the easiest way
to get it from LibreOffice to the

308
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:34,940
to get it from LibreOffice to the
 

309
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,180
to get it from LibreOffice to the
printing house in a format that I feel

310
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,190
printing house in a format that I feel
 

311
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,430
printing house in a format that I feel
confident is going to come out well in

312
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
confident is going to come out well in
 

313
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,830
confident is going to come out well in
print because I can tag the PDF so that

314
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
print because I can tag the PDF so that

373
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,579

compressed files to CPU then you can

374
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:15,589
compressed files to CPU then you can
 

375
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,809
compressed files to CPU then you can
unzip it and you can yeah okay okay that

376

starting to get in to the bandwagon of
 

411
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,759
starting to get in to the bandwagon of
realizing that they need to be able to

412
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:03,769
realizing that they need to be able to
 

413

open yes they can they can use it but

414
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:06,529

417
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,379

509
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,590
so that they can open it and it looks
exactly how it should but if I send them

the Excel or the xcf file they may not
 

513
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:13,610
program so things might get a little bit
 

519
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,449
program so things might get a little bit
garbled but as long as I still have that

so so I think that's the next thing that
 

567
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,760
so so I think that's the next thing that
is using yes turn his head down maybe is

568
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:24,770
is using yes turn his head down maybe is
 

569
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,810
is using yes turn his head down maybe is
covering the yeah it does I hear it

wrestling when you move it so maybe it

572
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:30,529
wrestling when you move it so maybe it
 

573
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,130
wrestling when you move it so maybe it
is just a poor microphone but you can do

574
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,140
is just a poor microphone but you can do
 

575
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,380
is just a poor microphone but you can do
what I did which is get a headset which

576
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,390
what I did which is get a headset which
 

577
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,740
what I did which is get a headset which
helps it doesn't sound perfect but at

578
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:38,750
helps it doesn't sound perfect but at
 

579
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,420
helps it doesn't sound perfect but at
least if I move around you can still

580
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,430

581
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,370
least if I move around you can still
hear me just as well over here is over

headsets I think that would maybe be a
 

589
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,300
headsets I think that would maybe be a
better way to do it it would bring the

590
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,310
better way to do it it would bring the
 

591
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,340
better way to do it it would bring the
microphone closer to his mouth too

592
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,350
microphone closer to his mouth too
 

593
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,960

789
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,680
and then you open zoom zoom won't see
anything because the other program has

00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:25,690
anything because the other program has
 

791
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,680
anything because the other program has
already grabbed controls all right well
