00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:35,900
I feel like I should be able to do one a
 

159
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,190
I feel like I should be able to do one a
week we'll see but but I'll know a

160
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
week we'll see but but I'll know a
 

161
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,410
week we'll see but but I'll know a
little bit better on Monday how I'm

162
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,420
little bit better on Monday how I'm
 

163
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,910
little bit better on Monday how I'm
going to structure things and how we're

164
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:42,920
going to structure things and how we're
 

165
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,500
going to structure things and how we're
going to change it because now maybe

166
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,510
going to change it because now maybe
 

167
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,630
going to change it because now maybe
maybe this becomes a little more

168
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
maybe this becomes a little more
 

169
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,920
maybe this becomes a little more
structured and more of a show like yeah

170
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:50,930
structured and more of a show like yeah
 

171
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,640
structured and more of a show like yeah
it's kind of evolved into that so and I

172
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:54,650
it's kind of evolved into that so and I
 

173
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,990
it's kind of evolved into that so and I
think it's a really cool opportunity I

174
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
think it's a really cool opportunity I
 

175
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,210
think it's a really cool opportunity I
know all of you guys have had chances

176
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:58,220
know all of you guys have had chances
 

177
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,740
know all of you guys have had chances
and others who have been a part of the

178
00:03:59,740 --> 00:03:59,750
and others who have been a part of the
 

179
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,500
and others who have been a part of the
coffee break do to share some of the

180
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:02,510
coffee break do to share some of the
 

181
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,030
coffee break do to share some of the
cool tech that you're working with and

182
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,040
cool tech that you're working with and
 

183
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,620
cool tech that you're working with and
we're learning all kinds of stuff from

184
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:05,630
we're learning all kinds of stuff from
 

185
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,290
we're learning all kinds of stuff from
vp9 and Sol boo you've shown us some

186
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:08,300
vp9 and Sol boo you've shown us some
 

187
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,729
vp9 and Sol boo you've shown us some
some of the stuff that you're working on

188
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:09,739
some of the stuff that you're working on
 

189
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:12,550
some of the stuff that you're working on
and even Peter with his programming and

190
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
and even Peter with his programming and
 

191
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,530
and even Peter with his programming and
everything else and and he knows a lot

192
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:14,540
everything else and and he knows a lot
 

193
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,810
everything else and and he knows a lot
about like the circuit circuitry and

194
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:16,820
about like the circuit circuitry and
 

195
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,240
about like the circuit circuitry and
power supplies and so I'm learning as

196
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,250
power supplies and so I'm learning as
 

197
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,830
power supplies and so I'm learning as
well and and I think you know if we all

198
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:20,840
well and and I think you know if we all
 

199
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,620
well and and I think you know if we all
take take turns kind of presenting even

200
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:23,630
take take turns kind of presenting even
 

201
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,750
take take turns kind of presenting even
and and make that yeah I don't know

202
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:25,760
and and make that yeah I don't know
 

203
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,430
and and make that yeah I don't know
we'll see how things as well

204
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
we'll see how things as well
 

205
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,320
we'll see how things as well
I think in the next year he's selling

206
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,330
I think in the next year he's selling
 

207
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,720
I think in the next year he's selling
his blockbuster game on there I want to

208
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:37,730
his blockbuster game on there I want to
 

209
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,910
his blockbuster game on there I want to
say I want to say that the shorts yes

210
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:39,920
say I want to say that the shorts yes
 

211
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,240
say I want to say that the shorts yes
yeah so so just keep in mind there won't

212
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,250
yeah so so just keep in mind there won't
 

213
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,820
yeah so so just keep in mind there won't
be a copy break tomorrow and so we'll

214
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:45,830
be a copy break tomorrow and so we'll
 

215
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,580
be a copy break tomorrow and so we'll
see you again on Monday after today's

216
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:48,590
see you again on Monday after today's
 

217
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,220
see you again on Monday after today's
coffee break now all that said how's

218
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,230
coffee break now all that said how's
 

219
00:04:51,230 --> 00:05:06,540
coffee break now all that said how's
everybody doing I watched a video today

220
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:06,550

 

221
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,310

now we're at that point we're at that

222
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,320
now we're at that point we're at that
 

223
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,960
now we're at that point we're at that
point now where he's saying I saw a

224
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:10,970
point now where he's saying I saw a
 

225
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,660
point now where he's saying I saw a
video earlier today so we're catching up

226
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:13,670
video earlier today so we're catching up
 

227
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,910
video earlier today so we're catching up
in the time this remote space time note

228
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:15,920
in the time this remote space time note
 

229
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,250
in the time this remote space time note
this reminds me of a video not that this

230
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,260
this reminds me of a video not that this
 

231
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,430
this reminds me of a video not that this
reminds me of a video but I saw just now

232
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
reminds me of a video but I saw just now
 

233
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,670
reminds me of a video but I saw just now
on an interview by a brain turning and

234
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
on an interview by a brain turning and
 

235
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,620
on an interview by a brain turning and
interviewed Ken Thompson in January of

236
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:32,630
interviewed Ken Thompson in January of
 

237
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,920
interviewed Ken Thompson in January of
last year about the history of Unix that

238
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:38,930
last year about the history of Unix that
 

239
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,930
last year about the history of Unix that
was the idea

240
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:39,940
was the idea
 

241
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:47,950
was the idea
and then he mentioned how he unix came

242
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:47,960
and then he mentioned how he unix came
 

243
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,020
and then he mentioned how he unix came
about and how the c programming language

244
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,030
about and how the c programming language
 

245
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,150
about and how the c programming language
they came about and i didn't notice but

246
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,160
they came about and i didn't notice but
 

247
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,440
they came about and i didn't notice but
the c programming language the name is

248
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,450
the c programming language the name is
 

249
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,440
the c programming language the name is
kind of a joke there was an earlier

250
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,450
kind of a joke there was an earlier
 

251
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:09,370
kind of a joke there was an earlier
programming language called the four

252
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,380
programming language called the four
 

253
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,020
programming language called the four
letters program language early in the

254
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,030
letters program language early in the
 

255
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,030
letters program language early in the
around 70s or something and it was a

256
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,040
around 70s or something and it was a
 

257
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,240
around 70s or something and it was a
little complicated so somewhat

258
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,250
little complicated so somewhat
 

259
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,000
little complicated so somewhat
simplified the language and could it be

260
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,010
simplified the language and could it be
 

261
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,260
simplified the language and could it be
just the first letter of the longer name

262
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,270
just the first letter of the longer name
 

263
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,939
just the first letter of the longer name
and then when the

264
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:31,949
and then when the
 

265
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,009
and then when the
and then they improved that a little bit

266
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:35,019
and then they improved that a little bit
 

267
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,369
and then they improved that a little bit
I think it was also because there be

268
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:38,379
I think it was also because there be
 

269
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,049
I think it was also because there be
programming language didn't work well on

270
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:40,059
programming language didn't work well on
 

271
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,969
programming language didn't work well on
the PD in eleven and so he improved the

272
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:44,979
the PD in eleven and so he improved the
 

273
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,100
the PD in eleven and so he improved the
B language and since he had changed it

274
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,110
B language and since he had changed it
 

275
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,549
B language and since he had changed it
he landed C thing to remember about C is

276
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:53,559
he landed C thing to remember about C is
 

277
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,429
he landed C thing to remember about C is
that it only consists of Oh less than

278
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:56,439
that it only consists of Oh less than
 

279
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,239
that it only consists of Oh less than
thirty three zero runtime functions that

280
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:00,249
thirty three zero runtime functions that
 

281
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:02,069
thirty three zero runtime functions that
are built into the runtime itself

282
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:02,079
are built into the runtime itself
 

283
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,979
are built into the runtime itself
everything else is all libraries that's

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:04,989
everything else is all libraries that's
 

285
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,809
everything else is all libraries that's
that that's the thing to remember the

286
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:06,819
that that's the thing to remember the
 

287
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,179
that that's the thing to remember the
same is true by the way Peter the same

00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:09,189
same is true by the way Peter the same
 

289
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:12,509
same is true by the way Peter the same
is true of Dell most of what you when

290
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:12,519
is true of Dell most of what you when
 

291
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,999
is true of Dell most of what you when
most of what you see in Pascal it only

292
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:18,009
most of what you see in Pascal it only
 

293
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,199
most of what you see in Pascal it only
consists of I don't know audio maybe not

00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,290
consists of I don't know audio maybe not
even that many actual built-in functions

296
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:25,300
even that many actual built-in functions
 

297
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,969
even that many actual built-in functions
all the rest of it is libraries just

298
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:26,979
all the rest of it is libraries just
 

299
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:37,529
all the rest of it is libraries just
like would say that was by accident it

300
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:37,539
like would say that was by accident it
 

301
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,929
like would say that was by accident it
was supposed to be a print solution or

302
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:39,939
was supposed to be a print solution or
 

303
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:48,600
was supposed to be a print solution or
something wasn't it yeah and the Bell

304
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,610
something wasn't it yeah and the Bell
 

305
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,759
something wasn't it yeah and the Bell
Labs the Bell Labs they were quite

306
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:55,769
Labs the Bell Labs they were quite
 

307
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:22,009
Labs the Bell Labs they were quite
insistent they did not need the few guys

308
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:22,019
insistent they did not need the few guys
 

309
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,839
insistent they did not need the few guys
and here Brian mentioned that he had a

310
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:26,849
and here Brian mentioned that he had a
 

311
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,109
and here Brian mentioned that he had a
single-digit

312
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:28,119
single-digit
 

313
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:37,220
single-digit

731
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,919
worst-case scenario well I had my 10
terabyte drive to restore from and I

732
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:14,929
terabyte drive to restore from and I
 

733
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:18,310

very carefully copied just the backup

734
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
very carefully copied just the backup
 

735
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,580
very carefully copied just the backup

files without zipping them or anything
 

737
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,919
files without zipping them or anything
like that directly to the dry so they

738
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:23,929
like that directly to the dry so they
 

739
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,720
like that directly to the dry so they
should be just as usable from the drive

740
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:25,730
should be just as usable from the drive
 

741
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,570
should be just as usable from the drive
as they are from from Burnett's so

742
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:28,580
as they are from from Burnett's so
 

743

trust your backups there's things that I
 

753
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,639
trust your backups there's things that I
tell that I tell my customers and that

tell that I tell my customers and that
 

755
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,690

mm-hmm
 

757
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,600
mm-hmm
first thing is exactly what the nail

758
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:46,610
first thing is exactly what the nail
 

759
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,759
first thing is exactly what the nail
that year hit and right now is you want

760
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:48,769
that year hit and right now is you want
 

761
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,950
that year hit and right now is you want
to know that your backup is it has

762
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
to know that your backup is it has
 

763
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,750
to know that your backup is it has
integrity it has the files that you're

764
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:52,760
integrity it has the files that you're
 

765
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,480
integrity it has the files that you're
expecting to be there and you're able to

766
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,490
expecting to be there and you're able to
 

767
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,419
expecting to be there and you're able to
recover but in business there's a second

768
00:19:58,419 --> 00:19:58,429
recover but in business there's a second
 

769
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:01,419
recover but in business there's a second
factor to that tests and that's how long

770
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:01,429
factor to that tests and that's how long
 

771
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:02,799
factor to that tests and that's how long
is it going to take you to recover

772
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:02,809
is it going to take you to recover
 

773
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,259
is it going to take you to recover
because in a business if you get hit by

774
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:05,269
because in a business if you get hit by
 

775
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:09,070
because in a business if you get hit by
ransomware yeah or you have your server

776
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,080
ransomware yeah or you have your server
 

777
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,930
ransomware yeah or you have your server
crash or you have a fire or something

crash or you have a fire or something
 

779
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,990
crash or you have a fire or something
like that how long are you going to be

780
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
like that how long are you going to be
 

781
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,750
like that how long are you going to be
down for we'll determine how many staff

782
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:16,760
