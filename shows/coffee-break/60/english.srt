changed the meeting id
 

333
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,350
changed the meeting id
honestly and he also changed the

334
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
honestly and he also changed the
 

335
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,070
honestly and he also changed the
password yes he did i

336
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
password yes he did i
 

337
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,150
password yes he did i
i did figure it out this is the you

338
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
i did figure it out this is the you
 

339
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,110
i did figure it out this is the you
figured it out

340
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
figured it out
 

341
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,350
figured it out
yeah you're here this is you're here

342
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
yeah you're here this is you're here
 

343
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,629
yeah you're here this is you're here
so how do you wire into that you don't

344
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
so how do you wire into that you don't
 

345
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,909
so how do you wire into that you don't
what it is is um okay so

346
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
what it is is um okay so
 

347
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,870
what it is is um okay so
this is the back of the uh of the unit

348
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
this is the back of the uh of the unit
 

349
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,350
this is the back of the uh of the unit
right

350
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
right
 

351
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,150
right
yeah so yeah on this side are the

352
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
yeah so yeah on this side are the
 

353
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,589
yeah so yeah on this side are the
charging connectors

354
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
charging connectors
 

355
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,390
charging connectors
right and they're also they also have

356
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
right and they're also they also have
 

357
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,189
right and they're also they also have
magnets

358
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
magnets
 

359
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,510
magnets
and so the whole point is that it'll

360
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
and so the whole point is that it'll
 

361
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,029
and so the whole point is that it'll
drop right into the

362
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
drop right into the
 

363
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,430
drop right into the
charging cradle and then these

364
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
charging cradle and then these
 

365
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,189
charging cradle and then these
connections on the back will

366
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
connections on the back will
 

367
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,909
connections on the back will
will charge right oh okay this is the

368
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
will charge right oh okay this is the
 

369
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,270
will charge right oh okay this is the
cat this is the camera

370
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
cat this is the camera
 

371
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,070
cat this is the camera
oh that not the camera the uh heart

372
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
oh that not the camera the uh heart
 

373
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,430
oh that not the camera the uh heart
sensor opening

374
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
sensor opening
 

375
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,749
sensor opening
um it's a window and this is the

376
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
um it's a window and this is the
 

377
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,270
um it's a window and this is the
charging connectors

378
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
charging connectors
 

379
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,589
charging connectors
but i couldn't figure out what this was

380
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
but i couldn't figure out what this was
 

381
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,270
but i couldn't figure out what this was
and uh what it is it looks like it's a

382
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
and uh what it is it looks like it's a
 

383
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,629
and uh what it is it looks like it's a
spring mechanism

384
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
spring mechanism
 

385
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,029
spring mechanism
it is it's a spring mechanism that that

386
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
it is it's a spring mechanism that that
 

387
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,870
it is it's a spring mechanism that that
makes electrical connection with the

388
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
makes electrical connection with the
 

389
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,909
makes electrical connection with the
circuit board

390
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
circuit board
 

391
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,150
circuit board
it is the actual actuator it's the it's

392
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
it is the actual actuator it's the it's
 

393
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,510
it is the actual actuator it's the it's
the vibrator

394
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
the vibrator
 

395
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,869
the vibrator
so there's a there's a small weight

396
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
so there's a there's a small weight
 

397
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,629
so there's a there's a small weight
you can see it's a silver thing a small

398
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
you can see it's a silver thing a small
 

399
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,110
you can see it's a silver thing a small
weight right there it just spins that

400
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
weight right there it just spins that
 

401
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,110
weight right there it just spins that
whenever it wants to um whenever it

402
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
whenever it wants to um whenever it
 

403
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,110
whenever it wants to um whenever it
wants the thing to vibrate on your rum

404
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
wants the thing to vibrate on your rum
 

405
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,909
wants the thing to vibrate on your rum
on your wrist so yep that's what that's

406
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
on your wrist so yep that's what that's
 

407
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,029
on your wrist so yep that's what that's
what that's for

408
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
what that's for
 

409
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,469
what that's for
um but in order to program it all i need

410
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
um but in order to program it all i need
 

411
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,909
um but in order to program it all i need
is the front face part

412
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
is the front face part
 

413
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,150
is the front face part
which looks really as you noted looks

414
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
which looks really as you noted looks
 

415
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,350
which looks really as you noted looks
really suspicious

416
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
really suspicious
 

417
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,990
really suspicious
with wires and all that but it looks a

418
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
with wires and all that but it looks a
 

419
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,150
with wires and all that but it looks a
little a little bulky to have around

420
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
little a little bulky to have around
 

421
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,270
little a little bulky to have around
your wrist

422
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
your wrist
 

423
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,510
your wrist
just a little bit yeah yeah however just

a bit you would
 

427
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,710
a bit you would
you would stand out yeah i bet

428
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
you would stand out yeah i bet
 

429
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,189
you would stand out yeah i bet
yeah all right look at that time wow

430
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
yeah all right look at that time wow
 

431
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,150
yeah all right look at that time wow
look at that

432
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160

 

433
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,230

you're just waiting for someone to say

434
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
you're just waiting for someone to say
 

435
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,070
you're just waiting for someone to say
what time is it

436
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
what time is it
 

437
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,550
what time is it
let me tell you not really not really

438
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
let me tell you not really not really

441
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:53,030

i

442
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040

 

443
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,190

like a looks like an atx kind of

444
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
like a looks like an atx kind of
 

445
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,870
like a looks like an atx kind of
computer chassis that you've

446
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
computer chassis that you've
 

447
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,750
computer chassis that you've
mounted a whole bunch of high voltage

448
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
mounted a whole bunch of high voltage
 

449
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,430
mounted a whole bunch of high voltage
stuff into that scares the

450
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
stuff into that scares the
 

451
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,670
stuff into that scares the
crap out of me it's only 32 volts

452
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
crap out of me it's only 32 volts
 

453
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:21,190
crap out of me it's only 32 volts
robbie's off dangerous

454
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200

 

455
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,990

out so uh um so it's all together now

456
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
out so uh um so it's all together now
 

457
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,110
out so uh um so it's all together now
so uh it looks a bit like bp nine thing

458
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
so uh it looks a bit like bp nine thing
 

459
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,110
so uh it looks a bit like bp nine thing
with all the while sticking out of it

460
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
with all the while sticking out of it
 

461
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:48,870
with all the while sticking out of it
at the moment pretty scary in it yeah

462
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880

 

463
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,310

it looks like a computer chassis and put

464
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
it looks like a computer chassis and put
 

465
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,150
it looks like a computer chassis and put
a bunch of components into it

466
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
a bunch of components into it
 

467
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,470
a bunch of components into it
to create his own power supply unit

468
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
to create his own power supply unit
 

469
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,829
to create his own power supply unit
which is pretty neat so

470
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
which is pretty neat so
 

471
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,509
which is pretty neat so
peter's really uh gifted at that kind of

472
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
peter's really uh gifted at that kind of
 

473
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,430
peter's really uh gifted at that kind of
stuff the circuitry

474
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
stuff the circuitry
 

475
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,389
stuff the circuitry
yeah very cool very cool sasha what's

476
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
yeah very cool very cool sasha what's
 

477
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,150
yeah very cool very cool sasha what's
new like what uh what's going on we

478
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
new like what uh what's going on we
 

479
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,590
new like what uh what's going on we
haven't seen you for a while so i feel

480
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
haven't seen you for a while so i feel
 

481
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,110
haven't seen you for a while so i feel
like it'd be nice to kind of catch up

482
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
like it'd be nice to kind of catch up
 

483
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,710
like it'd be nice to kind of catch up
while we can

484
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
while we can
 

485
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,990
while we can
here you know what i'll do is i will um

486
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
here you know what i'll do is i will um
 

487
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,230
here you know what i'll do is i will um
maybe i'll switch around my camera and i

488
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
maybe i'll switch around my camera and i
 

489
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,990
maybe i'll switch around my camera and i
can like give you a little bit of a walk

490
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
can like give you a little bit of a walk
 

491
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,790
can like give you a little bit of a walk
through of what

492
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
through of what
 

493
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,030
through of what
this if i can okay so let's see i'm i'm
