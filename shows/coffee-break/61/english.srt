00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:51,900
in multiple devices but independent as
 

159
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,949
in multiple devices but independent as
in each one will have its own distro

160
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:53,959
in each one will have its own distro
 

161
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,140
in each one will have its own distro
raspberry pi unit that will each have

162
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,150
raspberry pi unit that will each have
 

163
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,010
raspberry pi unit that will each have
the Raspberry Pi OS and zoom install and

164
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,020
the Raspberry Pi OS and zoom install and
 

165
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,710
the Raspberry Pi OS and zoom install and
each one of those has an HDMI output so

166
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
each one of those has an HDMI output so
 

167
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,520
each one of those has an HDMI output so
then each Raspberry Pi becomes a camera

168
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,530
then each Raspberry Pi becomes a camera
 

169
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,790
then each Raspberry Pi becomes a camera
source essentially for zoom so I'd have

170
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:13,800
source essentially for zoom so I'd have
 

171
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,789
source essentially for zoom so I'd have
one Raspberry Pi dedicated to Jeff and

172
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
one Raspberry Pi dedicated to Jeff and
 

173
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,220
one Raspberry Pi dedicated to Jeff and
that would be HDMI out into his capture

174
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,230
that would be HDMI out into his capture
 

175
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,870
that would be HDMI out into his capture
and then when I push the button on the

176
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
and then when I push the button on the
 

177
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,300
and then when I push the button on the
on the stream deck it would switch to

178
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,310
on the stream deck it would switch to
 

179
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,880
on the stream deck it would switch to
his camera basically and then have one

180
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:25,890
his camera basically and then have one
 

181
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,660
his camera basically and then have one
procession one for Henry and

182
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,670
procession one for Henry and
 

183
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,550
procession one for Henry and
however we want to set it up so it's

184
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:29,560
however we want to set it up so it's
 

185
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,260
however we want to set it up so it's
just like one Raspberry Pi per person it

186
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,270
just like one Raspberry Pi per person it
 

187
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,070
just like one Raspberry Pi per person it
might work

188
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,080
might work
 

189
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,320
might work
so that's kind of where I'm sorry I

190
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,330
so that's kind of where I'm sorry I
 

191
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,120
so that's kind of where I'm sorry I
think I missed what it is you were

192
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,130
think I missed what it is you were
 

193
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,630
think I missed what it is you were
meaning to do with that Raspberry Pi

194
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:41,640
meaning to do with that Raspberry Pi
 

195
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,090
meaning to do with that Raspberry Pi
being able to have it have them come in

196
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,100
being able to have it have them come in
 

197
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,200
being able to have it have them come in
remotely through zoom ah I see okay

198
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,210
remotely through zoom ah I see okay
 

199
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,060
remotely through zoom ah I see okay
because for the show

200
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,070
because for the show
 

201
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,590
because for the show
we obviously don't want this grid layout

202
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,600
we obviously don't want this grid layout
 

203
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,510
we obviously don't want this grid layout
and we can't have it so that it's

204
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
and we can't have it so that it's
 

205
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,950
and we can't have it so that it's
switching back and forth every time

206
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:55,960
switching back and forth every time
 

207
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,830
switching back and forth every time
someone speaks and okay no you need a

208
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:58,840
someone speaks and okay no you need a
 

209
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,450
someone speaks and okay no you need a
separate input for each of them so you

210
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:00,460
separate input for each of them so you
 

211
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,850
separate input for each of them so you
can edit them post electrician anyway

212
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:02,860
can edit them post electrician anyway
 

213
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,920
can edit them post electrician anyway
you don't even and even live we need to

214
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:04,930
you don't even and even live we need to
 

215
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,480
you don't even and even live we need to
be able to switch to the person who's

216
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,490
be able to switch to the person who's
 

217
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,480
be able to switch to the person who's
speaking manually and I and and people

218
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,490
speaking manually and I and and people
 

219
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,110
speaking manually and I and and people
may not realize but zoom cannot be

220
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
may not realize but zoom cannot be
 

221
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
may not realize but zoom cannot be
running on the broadcast system because

222
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:14,890
running on the broadcast system because
 

223
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,950
running on the broadcast system because
it's broadcasting so that means the good

224
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
it's broadcasting so that means the good
 

225
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,580
it's broadcasting so that means the good
camera that I use is out of it basically

226
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:20,590
camera that I use is out of it basically
 

227
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,920
camera that I use is out of it basically
is so during the interview or during the

228
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:22,930
is so during the interview or during the
 

229
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,470
is so during the interview or during the
conversation I would be on my phone

230
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:24,480
conversation I would be on my phone
 

231
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,090
conversation I would be on my phone
which would then you've done you've done

232
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,100
which would then you've done you've done
 

233
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,190
which would then you've done you've done
this before though was I recall because

234
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,200
this before though was I recall because
 

235
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,460
this before though was I recall because
you you did the same thing I live oh

236
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:34,470
you you did the same thing I live oh
 

237
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:43,200
you you did the same thing I live oh
good point yeah Wednesday we found that

238
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,210
good point yeah Wednesday we found that
 

239
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,660
good point yeah Wednesday we found that
out when my pine book probe would not

240
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:45,670
out when my pine book probe would not
 

241
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,690
out when my pine book probe would not
work for the feature and then so then

242
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:48,700
work for the feature and then so then
 

243
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,260
work for the feature and then so then
signed off rebooted changed the way I

244
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,270
signed off rebooted changed the way I
 

245
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,810
signed off rebooted changed the way I
connected things I plugged the I plugged

246
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:54,820
connected things I plugged the I plugged
 

247
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,150
connected things I plugged the I plugged
the atomos ninja flame into the pine

248
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,160
the atomos ninja flame into the pine
 

249
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,460
the atomos ninja flame into the pine
Book Pro and pushed the cord mm-hmm

250
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,470
Book Pro and pushed the cord mm-hmm
 

251
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,830
Book Pro and pushed the cord mm-hmm
worked flawlessly so some and if not a

252
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
worked flawlessly so some and if not a
 

253
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,090
worked flawlessly so some and if not a
half a dozen raspberry pi for eight gigs

254
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,100
half a dozen raspberry pi for eight gigs
 

255
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,990
half a dozen raspberry pi for eight gigs
yeah exactly

256
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,000
yeah exactly
 

257
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,660
yeah exactly
so well I think four would do it because

258
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:09,670
so well I think four would do it because
 

259
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,370
so well I think four would do it because
four is as many inputs as I have oh that

260
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:13,380
four is as many inputs as I have oh that
 

261
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,360
four is as many inputs as I have oh that
yeah so then we just basically that

262
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,370
yeah so then we just basically that
 

263
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,430
yeah so then we just basically that
would allow us to treat each person on

264
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,440
would allow us to treat each person on
 

265
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,670
would allow us to treat each person on
their zoom connection as a as a camera

266
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
their zoom connection as a as a camera
 

267
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,460
their zoom connection as a as a camera
source so I think that could work and

268
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,470
source so I think that could work and
 

269
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,380
source so I think that could work and
it's probably a pretty good way to do it

270
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,390
it's probably a pretty good way to do it
 

271
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,540
it's probably a pretty good way to do it
on the cheap on the cheap it's going to

272
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:30,550
on the cheap on the cheap it's going to
 

273
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,520
on the cheap on the cheap it's going to
cost like you know four raspberry pies

274
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,530
cost like you know four raspberry pies
 

275
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,430
cost like you know four raspberry pies
here in Canada is like 600 bucks so you

276
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
here in Canada is like 600 bucks so you
 

277
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,030
here in Canada is like 600 bucks so you
know what selectee dollars American Rush

278
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,040
know what selectee dollars American Rush
 

279
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,660
know what selectee dollars American Rush
[Laughter]

280
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:39,670
[Laughter]
 

281
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,420
[Laughter]
ridiculous Robert said to me because

282
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,430
ridiculous Robert said to me because
 

283
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,100
ridiculous Robert said to me because
Robert in Florida right he's like oh

284
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,110
Robert in Florida right he's like oh
 

285
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,260
Robert in Florida right he's like oh
yeah raspberry-pi it's only 75 bucks for

286
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,270
yeah raspberry-pi it's only 75 bucks for
 

287
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,550
yeah raspberry-pi it's only 75 bucks for
the new one really 110 dollars here just

288
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
the new one really 110 dollars here just
 

289
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,770
the new one really 110 dollars here just
for the board plus you gotta buy the

290
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:52,780
for the board plus you gotta buy the
 

291
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,590
for the board plus you gotta buy the
power supply plus you gotta buy the case

292
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600

 

293
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,120

I'm not even sure I'd use a rough spot

294
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,130
I'm not even sure I'd use a rough spot
 

295
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,270
I'm not even sure I'd use a rough spot
for that anymore I probably you've

296
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
for that anymore I probably you've
 

297
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,010
for that anymore I probably you've
already already been talking about the

298
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,020
already already been talking about the
 

299
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,600
already already been talking about the
owner you've already been talking about

300
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,610
owner you've already been talking about
 

301
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,900
owner you've already been talking about
the Odroid what c4 I believe yeah I

302
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:12,910
the Odroid what c4 I believe yeah I
 

303
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,730
the Odroid what c4 I believe yeah I
don't know I haven't looked yet I don't

304
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:14,740
don't know I haven't looked yet I don't
 

305
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,620
don't know I haven't looked yet I don't
know if they're any cheaper and they get

306
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:16,630
know if they're any cheaper and they get
 

307
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,660
know if they're any cheaper and they get
hit up a mirror droid will see you see

308
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:18,670
hit up a mirror droid will see you see
 

309
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,850
hit up a mirror droid will see you see
what they've got my top light my problem

310
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:23,860
what they've got my top light my problem
 

311
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,970
what they've got my top light my problem
yeah I really don't like and much menu

312
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:29,980
yeah I really don't like and much menu
 

313
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
yeah I really don't like and much menu
you've seen this too right

314
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:31,990
you've seen this too right
 

315
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,680
you've seen this too right
you've seen where the raspberry pie if

316
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:34,690
you've seen where the raspberry pie if
 

317
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,190
you've seen where the raspberry pie if
it loses power potentially that SD card

318
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,200
it loses power potentially that SD card
 

319
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,800
it loses power potentially that SD card
yeah it's corrupted you can't afford

320
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:40,810
yeah it's corrupted you can't afford
 

321
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,640
yeah it's corrupted you can't afford
that especially especially not live so

322
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,650
that especially especially not live so
 

323
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,650
that especially especially not live so
you know maybe maybe once an option but

324
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:46,660
you know maybe maybe once an option but
 

325
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,090
you know maybe maybe once an option but
I don't know what the crotch point is

326
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,100
I don't know what the crotch point is
 

327
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,340
I don't know what the crotch point is
though so maybe maybe just a bunch of a

328
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,350
though so maybe maybe just a bunch of a

what you're thinking and it's got HDMI I

334
00:07:59,640 --> 00:07:59,650
what you're thinking and it's got HDMI I
 

335
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,450
what you're thinking and it's got HDMI I
was strictly thinking you know I I just

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:06,790
need a sec with some H HDMI output but
 

339
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,040
need a sec with some H HDMI output but
you're right it doesn't have to be

00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,050
you're right it doesn't have to be
 

341
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,540
you're right it doesn't have to be
Raspberry Pi no you need for it to work

342
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:12,550
Raspberry Pi no you need for it to work
 

343
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,880
Raspberry Pi no you need for it to work
especially when you're alive you can't

344
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:14,890
especially when you're alive you can't
 

345
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,970
especially when you're alive you can't
afford to be having it break down

346
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:16,980
afford to be having it break down
 

347
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,120
afford to be having it break down

I'm in trouble because that our 510 is

360
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:43,420
I'm in trouble because that our 510 is

362
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
going there you've got a retina beeping
 

363
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,450
going there you've got a retina beeping
yes don't you I do yeah I gotta get new

364
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:48,460
yes don't you I do yeah I gotta get new
 

365
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,160
yes don't you I do yeah I gotta get new
batteries and that thing well

366
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,170
batteries and that thing well
 

367
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,430
batteries and that thing well
good point yeah I threw it out there for

368
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
good point yeah I threw it out there for
 

369
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,100
good point yeah I threw it out there for
in case it would be done you know yes as

370
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,110
in case it would be done you know yes as
 

371
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,220
in case it would be done you know yes as
a peasant option so yeah I like that

372
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,230
a peasant option so yeah I like that
 

373
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,550
a peasant option so yeah I like that
idea

374
00:08:59,550 --> 00:08:59,560
idea
 

375
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,990
idea
Xu fours or the new C for any of those

376
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
Xu fours or the new C for any of those
 

377
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,790
Xu fours or the new C for any of those
would probably do just fine it's really

378
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:05,800
would probably do just fine it's really
 

379
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,370
would probably do just fine it's really
just plugging them in and then seeing

380
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:08,380
just plugging them in and then seeing
 

381
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,590
just plugging them in and then seeing
how they how they operate with zoom in

382
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,600
how they how they operate with zoom in
 

383
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,680
how they how they operate with zoom in
fullscreen I think it's a neat idea

384
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:13,690
fullscreen I think it's a neat idea
 

385
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:39,560

tech TV which is going to be an
 

415
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,340
tech TV which is going to be an
occasional feature but we're going to be

416
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,350
occasional feature but we're going to be
 

417
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,220

he's going to be presenting some
 

419
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,019
he's going to be presenting some
exciting things like how does the

420
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,029
exciting things like how does the
 

421
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,699
exciting things like how does the
blockchain work and he's going to be

422
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:20,709
blockchain work and he's going to be
 

423
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:22,400
blockchain work and he's going to be
showing us under the hood like behind

424
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,410
showing us under the hood like behind
 

425
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,350
showing us under the hood like behind
give us a github source code and stuff

426
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
give us a github source code and stuff
 

427
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
give us a github source code and stuff
like that how it actually functions and

428
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:28,570
like that how it actually functions and
 

429
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,810
like that how it actually functions and
and doing some more kind of geekery as

430
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:30,820
and doing some more kind of geekery as
 

431

opposed to just the news end of things

432
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:32,709
opposed to just the news end of things
 

433
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,870
opposed to just the news end of things
so we're going to be getting into the

434
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:33,880
so we're going to be getting into the
 

435
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,420
so we're going to be getting into the
the technical aspects of not just

436
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,430
the technical aspects of not just
 

437
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,100
the technical aspects of not just
cryptocurrency because we tend to think

438
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,110
cryptocurrency because we tend to think
 

439
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,600
cryptocurrency because we tend to think
of the blockchain is cryptocurrency but

440
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:39,610
of the blockchain is cryptocurrency but
 

441
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,400
of the blockchain is cryptocurrency but
it's so much more than that its

442
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,410
it's so much more than that its
 

443
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,579
it's so much more than that its
encryption its security its data storage

444
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:44,589
encryption its security its data storage
 

445
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,920
encryption its security its data storage
and we're gonna be getting into some of

446
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:46,930
and we're gonna be getting into some of
 

447
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,139
and we're gonna be getting into some of
that and and particularly because he

448
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:49,149
that and and particularly because he
 

449
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,240
that and and particularly because he
that's what he does he's going to be

450
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,250
that's what he does he's going to be
 

451
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,389
that's what he does he's going to be
hosting that particular feature so so

452
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
hosting that particular feature so so
 

453
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,829
hosting that particular feature so so
we're gonna have some of those coming up

454
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
we're gonna have some of those coming up
 

455
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,319
we're gonna have some of those coming up
so that's the final thing that we that

456
00:10:58,319 --> 00:10:58,329
so that's the final thing that we that
 

457
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,809
so that's the final thing that we that
we really covered that I wanted to share

458
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:00,819
we really covered that I wanted to share
 

459
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:03,120
we really covered that I wanted to share
with you guys a real quick question did

460
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,130
with you guys a real quick question did

pine Book Pro because you can get both
keyboard layouts but just the original

628
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:04,300
keyboard layouts but just the original
 

629
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,949
keyboard layouts but just the original
pine book I believe I did I believe it

630
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:07,959
pine book I believe I did I believe it
 

631
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,810
pine book I believe I did I believe it
doesn't have an auntie option am i right

632
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:09,820
doesn't have an auntie option am i right
 

633
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,210
doesn't have an auntie option am i right
so now did they though it's not a kind

634
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,220
so now did they though it's not a kind
 

635
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,000
so now did they though it's not a kind
of keyboard at all it's not a nice Nancy

636
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,010
of keyboard at all it's not a nice Nancy
 

637
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,090
of keyboard at all it's not a nice Nancy
so if I so I'm just I know this is

638
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:18,100
so if I so I'm just I know this is
 

639
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,670
so if I so I'm just I know this is
running through my head right now but if

640
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:20,680
running through my head right now but if
 

641
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,410
running through my head right now but if
iso is international standards

642
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,420
iso is international standards
 

643
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,900
iso is international standards
association okay so can we say ansi is

644
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:24,910
association okay so can we say ansi is
 

645
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:31,410
association okay so can we say ansi is
american not the stupid ISO yeah it's

646
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:31,420
american not the stupid ISO yeah it's
 

647
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,630
american not the stupid ISO yeah it's
not married if it is you were trying to

648
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:33,640
not married if it is you were trying to
 

649
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,920
not married if it is you were trying to
push you're trying to put in those

650
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:34,930
push you're trying to put in those
 

651
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,350
push you're trying to put in those
thousands upon thousands of Europeans

652
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
thousands upon thousands of Europeans
 

653
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,090
thousands upon thousands of Europeans
but that's okay

654
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,100
but that's okay
 

655
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,860
but that's okay
you really push it you're really trying

656
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:40,870
you really push it you're really trying
 

657
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,840
you really push it you're really trying
to push much man's buttons aren't you

658
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:42,850
to push much man's buttons aren't you
 

659
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,440
to push much man's buttons aren't you
dear I Roby no you said why here I don't

660
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,450
dear I Roby no you said why here I don't
 

661
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,450
dear I Roby no you said why here I don't
I

662
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:48,460
I
 

663
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,020
I
I hated that layout I think I just hope

664
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,030
I hated that layout I think I just hope
 

665
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,520
I hated that layout I think I just hope
that I didn't offend too many people

666
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,530
that I didn't offend too many people
 

667
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,940
that I didn't offend too many people
with my reaction to it it was well I

668
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:56,950
with my reaction to it it was well I
 

669
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,190
with my reaction to it it was well I
tried it - I didn't like it I went time

670
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
tried it - I didn't like it I went time
 

671
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,020
tried it - I didn't like it I went time
I fainted but I'm annoyed as all get-out

672
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,030
I fainted but I'm annoyed as all get-out
 

673
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,299
I fainted but I'm annoyed as all get-out
just you know what you used to that's

674
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:03,309
just you know what you used to that's
 

675
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:06,750
just you know what you used to that's
not right exactly but the mind book is

676
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:06,760
not right exactly but the mind book is
 

677
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,169
not right exactly but the mind book is
different they had to make compromises

678
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:10,179
different they had to make compromises
 

679
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,149
different they had to make compromises
for the size and had to move keys around

680
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:12,159
for the size and had to move keys around
 

681
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,510
for the size and had to move keys around
and ahead of delivered so it's not a

682
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
and ahead of delivered so it's not a
 

683
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,789
and ahead of delivered so it's not a
standard keyboard by any stretch of the

684
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:17,799
standard keyboard by any stretch of the
 

685
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,700
standard keyboard by any stretch of the
imagination yeah yeah well I'm still

686
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:20,710
imagination yeah yeah well I'm still
 

687
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,799
imagination yeah yeah well I'm still
having trouble making a good physical

695
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:31,289

there so I don't know what I don't know

there so I don't know what I don't know
what I'm gonna do with that yet whether

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:32,590
what I'm gonna do with that yet whether
 

699
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,919
what I'm gonna do with that yet whether
I'm gonna solve a some wise honor or

what do you do it came with a doc did

702
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:39,580
what do you do it came with a doc did
 

703
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,820
what do you do it came with a doc did
that not help the doc only provides

it'll just be there for for docking for

programming it now now how do you

716
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:09,970
programming it now now how do you
 

717
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,970
programming it now now how do you
program it when you when it's first

718
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:11,980
program it when you when it's first
 

719
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,649
program it when you when it's first
supply I guess that would be done at the

720
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:13,659
supply I guess that would be done at the
 

721
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,140
supply I guess that would be done at the
factory once they decide what image to

722
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,150
factory once they decide what image to
 

723
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,310
factory once they decide what image to
use to program it with but for now I've

724
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
use to program it with but for now I've
 

725
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,600
use to program it with but for now I've
just got to figure out how to make a

726
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:21,610
just got to figure out how to make a
 

727
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,250
just got to figure out how to make a
good physical connection because this

728
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,260
good physical connection because this
 

729
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,950
good physical connection because this
just isn't cutting it I I can't seem to

730
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:25,960
just isn't cutting it I I can't seem to
 

731
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,880
just isn't cutting it I I can't seem to
make fur

732
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:26,890
make fur
 

733
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,190
make fur
I think I got it to the point where the

I think I got it to the point where the

I think I got it to the point where the

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,360
there at least it wasn't complaining but
I couldn't make it I couldn't get an

are very very close on that boy and I'm

768
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:07,860
are very very close on that boy and I'm

781
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:36,660
got a good soul bring on Peter don't
worry thinking copper stop that crap is

then out like user some cables to put it

820
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,170
then out like user some cables to put it
 

821
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,860
then out like user some cables to put it
on to a well if I put pins in then I'll

822
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:37,870
on to a well if I put pins in then I'll
 

823
