00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,140
Windows machine from a mins ok so now
 

313
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,200
Windows machine from a mins ok so now
the old and and this is where a lot of

314
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,210
the old and and this is where a lot of
 

315
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,030
the old and and this is where a lot of
the confusion comes in and I got

316
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,040
the confusion comes in and I got
 

317
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,320
the confusion comes in and I got
confused with it as well a lot of the

318
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,330
confused with it as well a lot of the
 

319
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,750
confused with it as well a lot of the
services in Em's even though it's all

320
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:24,760
services in Em's even though it's all
 

321
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,430
services in Em's even though it's all
they're paying and everything it's all

322
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:26,440
they're paying and everything it's all
 

323
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,870
they're paying and everything it's all
based on n RPE that's all and you need

324
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:30,880
based on n RPE that's all and you need
 

325
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,140
based on n RPE that's all and you need
to use WMI so I think that's our biggest

326
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,150
to use WMI so I think that's our biggest
 

327
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,270
to use WMI so I think that's our biggest
problem is all these users are posting

328
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,280
problem is all these users are posting
 

329
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,070
problem is all these users are posting
like I'm setting it up and it's not that

330
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
like I'm setting it up and it's not that
 

331
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,740
like I'm setting it up and it's not that
kind of like yeah that's because it's

332
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:40,750
kind of like yeah that's because it's
 

333
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,170
kind of like yeah that's because it's
it's an old set up and you

334
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,180
it's an old set up and you
 

335
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,060
it's an old set up and you
and for NR PE you could get it working

336
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,070
and for NR PE you could get it working
 

337
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,720
and for NR PE you could get it working
if you install NS client on the Windows

338
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:48,730
if you install NS client on the Windows
 

339
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,690
if you install NS client on the Windows
machine and then jump through all these

340
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:51,700
machine and then jump through all these
 

341
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
machine and then jump through all these
hoops of fire and windows to get it to

342
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:53,710
hoops of fire and windows to get it to
 

343
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,220
hoops of fire and windows to get it to
work but that's just an old way of doing

344
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,230
work but that's just an old way of doing
 

345
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,170
work but that's just an old way of doing
it oh yeah and that RP is great for

346
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,180
it oh yeah and that RP is great for
 

347
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,050
it oh yeah and that RP is great for
Linux but yeah tough on what is this

348
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,060
Linux but yeah tough on what is this
 

349
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,450
Linux but yeah tough on what is this
network protocol that is allowed it's

350
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:06,460
network protocol that is allowed it's
 

351
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,370
network protocol that is allowed it's
not SMTP that's a simple mail transfer

352
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:08,380
not SMTP that's a simple mail transfer
 

353
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,970
not SMTP that's a simple mail transfer
protocol they've seen an EP or something

354
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:11,980
protocol they've seen an EP or something
 

355
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,480
protocol they've seen an EP or something
yeah SNMP is still a thing anymore yeah

356
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,490
yeah SNMP is still a thing anymore yeah
 

357
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,180
yeah SNMP is still a thing anymore yeah
yeah yeah we've got SNMP trapping on

358
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,190
yeah yeah we've got SNMP trapping on
 

359
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,740
yeah yeah we've got SNMP trapping on
UNM's ok oh it's gonna ask why wouldn't

360
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:22,750
UNM's ok oh it's gonna ask why wouldn't
 

361
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,310
UNM's ok oh it's gonna ask why wouldn't
you use a sending crate

362
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,320
you use a sending crate
 

363
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,380
you use a sending crate
windows includes WMI so you can

364
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,390
windows includes WMI so you can
 

365
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,900
windows includes WMI so you can
presumably be able to access statistics

366
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:30,910
presumably be able to access statistics
 

367
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,810
presumably be able to access statistics
like the CPU usage the RAM usage the

368
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:33,820
like the CPU usage the RAM usage the
 

369
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,340
like the CPU usage the RAM usage the
hard drive space all that stuff is all

370
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,350
hard drive space all that stuff is all
 

371
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,560
hard drive space all that stuff is all
built into WMI so that's what it's

372
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:37,570
built into WMI so that's what it's
 

373
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:46,280
built into WMI so that's what it's
that's what it's designed for usage

374
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,290
that's what it's designed for usage
 

375
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,540
that's what it's designed for usage
fantastic I don't think I have the

376
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,550
fantastic I don't think I have the
 

377
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,790
fantastic I don't think I have the
parameters correct for the windows the

378
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
parameters correct for the windows the
 

379
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,970
parameters correct for the windows the
CPU though cuz right in its average CPU

380
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:53,980
CPU though cuz right in its average CPU
 

381
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,330
CPU though cuz right in its average CPU
utilization need at least 2 WM I samples

382
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,340
utilization need at least 2 WM I samples
 

383
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,400
utilization need at least 2 WM I samples
so I don't think I have that set up

384
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,410
so I don't think I have that set up
 

385
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,480
so I don't think I have that set up
exactly Corona

386
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,490
exactly Corona
 

387
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,870
exactly Corona
ok but if you posted on that Aki that's

388
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:03,880
ok but if you posted on that Aki that's
 

389
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,510
ok but if you posted on that Aki that's
great yeah you got further than me cuz I

390
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:06,520
great yeah you got further than me cuz I
 

391
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,930
great yeah you got further than me cuz I
don't even have a Windows machine yeah

392
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:09,940
don't even have a Windows machine yeah
 

393
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,660
don't even have a Windows machine yeah
I've been like I'm so seriously I've

394
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:12,670
I've been like I'm so seriously I've
 

395
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,220
I've been like I'm so seriously I've
talked about it on the coffee break I'd

396
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,230
talked about it on the coffee break I'd
 

397
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,010
talked about it on the coffee break I'd
love to get like a 3u server chassis and

398
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,020
love to get like a 3u server chassis and
 

399
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,420
love to get like a 3u server chassis and
put a computer in there that's really

400
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:18,430
put a computer in there that's really
 

401
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,660
put a computer in there that's really
quiet and now it's like oh man because

402
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:21,670
quiet and now it's like oh man because
 

403
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,400
quiet and now it's like oh man because
if I could do that with a powerful

404
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:23,410
if I could do that with a powerful
 

405
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,800
if I could do that with a powerful
enough server or just a desktop machine

406
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:25,810
enough server or just a desktop machine
 

407
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,810
enough server or just a desktop machine
inside of a server case then I could

408
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:27,820
inside of a server case then I could
 

409
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,900
inside of a server case then I could
virtualize and create a sudo like

410
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:30,910
virtualize and create a sudo like
 

411
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,180
virtualize and create a sudo like
virtual Windows Network so that I don't

412
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,190
virtual Windows Network so that I don't
 

413
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,890
virtual Windows Network so that I don't
have to actually put Windows machines

414
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:34,900
have to actually put Windows machines
 

415
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:40,080
have to actually put Windows machines
around right so but if the aim is to be

416
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,090
around right so but if the aim is to be
 

417
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:46,290
around right so but if the aim is to be
able to monitor Windows machines then

418
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:46,300
able to monitor Windows machines then
 

419
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,150
able to monitor Windows machines then
you have to do what mash man is doing

420
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
you have to do what mash man is doing
 

421
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,820
you have to do what mash man is doing
over there - yeah yeah put a Windows

422
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:50,830
over there - yeah yeah put a Windows
 

423
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,500
over there - yeah yeah put a Windows
machine on the network and point names

424
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,510
machine on the network and point names
 

425
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,510
machine on the network and point names
at it and okay what do you got yeah

426
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:55,520
at it and okay what do you got yeah
 

427
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,700
at it and okay what do you got yeah
in a virtual in a virtual machine

428
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:57,710
in a virtual in a virtual machine
 

429
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,010
in a virtual in a virtual machine
Network I could just create a Windows

430
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,020
Network I could just create a Windows
 

431
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,720
Network I could just create a Windows
machine and I don't have to start

432
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:01,730
machine and I don't have to start
 

433
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,160
machine and I don't have to start
monkeying with one of my production

434
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,170
monkeying with one of my production
 

435
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,170
monkeying with one of my production
servers or something because I don't I

436
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:05,180
servers or something because I don't I
 

437
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,970
servers or something because I don't I
don't need it I don't need to monitor

438
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:06,980
don't need it I don't need to monitor
 

439
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,680
don't need it I don't need to monitor
Windows systems because I don't have any

440
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:08,690
Windows systems because I don't have any
 

441
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,430
Windows systems because I don't have any
so so for me it's just I have to be able

442
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:12,440
so so for me it's just I have to be able
 

443
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,410
so so for me it's just I have to be able
to provide documentation to the users so

444
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:14,420
to provide documentation to the users so
 

445
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,690
to provide documentation to the users so
I think bill everything that you're

446
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:16,700
I think bill everything that you're
 

447
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,670
I think bill everything that you're
doing is going to be fantastic because

448
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:18,680
doing is going to be fantastic because
 

449
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,290
doing is going to be fantastic because
you're basically doing what I don't have

450
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,300
you're basically doing what I don't have
 

451
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,170
you're basically doing what I don't have
the capability to do yes the I just spun

452
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:23,180
the capability to do yes the I just spun
 

453
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,350
the capability to do yes the I just spun
up to two VMs on my dad knows there's a

454
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,360
up to two VMs on my dad knows there's a
 

455
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,610
up to two VMs on my dad knows there's a
2016 and a 2019 so see my servers out of

456
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:30,620
2016 and a 2019 so see my servers out of
 

457
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,590
2016 and a 2019 so see my servers out of
space I don't have space on my server

458
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:32,600
space I don't have space on my server
 

459
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,260
space I don't have space on my server
hard drive space so that's my problem

460
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,270
hard drive space so that's my problem
 

461
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,450
hard drive space so that's my problem
because I want like two windows I run

462
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:37,460
because I want like two windows I run
 

463
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:48,120
because I want like two windows I run

sent both yeah he's a TV star now don't
 

539
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,930
sent both yeah he's a TV star now don't
you know so this is poor evaluation only

540
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:46,940
you know so this is poor evaluation only
 

541
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,420
you know so this is poor evaluation only

543
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:58,930

there we go closer yeah how many

544
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:58,940
there we go closer yeah how many
 

545
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,720
there we go closer yeah how many
gigabytes are a mass at vp9

546
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:03,730

 

547
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,030

looks like a gigabyte compatible

548
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
looks like a gigabyte compatible
 

549
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,030

cuz I can't read because it's that's

552
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
cuz I can't read because it's that's
 

553
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,610
cuz I can't read because it's that's
very PI 4 8 gig compatible but that's

554
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:15,620
very PI 4 8 gig compatible but that's
 

555
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,019
very PI 4 8 gig compatible but that's
gonna I'm gonna turn that into an M

556
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:17,029
gonna I'm gonna turn that into an M
 

557
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,579
gonna I'm gonna turn that into an M
server I think that's gonna be our nem

558
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:18,589
server I think that's gonna be our nem
 

559
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,050
server I think that's gonna be our nem
server here at the studio cuz that's

560
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,060
server here at the studio cuz that's
 

561
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,260

gonna be pretty brutally awesome for

562
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,270
gonna be pretty brutally awesome for
 

563
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,230
gonna be pretty brutally awesome for

them all on one voltage so you were
 

591
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,570
them all on one voltage so you were
gonna make some fireworks if I mistake I

592
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:17,580
gonna make some fireworks if I mistake I
 

593
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,370

yeah the argon one case are you familiar
 

611
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,280
yeah the argon one case are you familiar
with that no that's a fantastic looking

621
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,760
unlike the traditional Raspberry Pi case
where you end up with some stuff on the

622
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:01,770
where you end up with some stuff on the
 

623
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,420
where you end up with some stuff on the
front and the side and so they're not

624
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,430
front and the side and so they're not
 

625
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,840
front and the side and so they're not
really not really so it puts everything

626
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:11,850
really not really so it puts everything
 

627
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,670
really not really so it puts everything
out the back yeah and it's got a

628
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
out the back yeah and it's got a
 

629
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,230
out the back yeah and it's got a
software power switch so you can program

630
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
software power switch so you can program
 

631
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,850
software power switch so you can program
what you want it to do when you push the

632
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:16,860
what you want it to do when you push the
 

633
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,040
what you want it to do when you push the
power button mm-hmm it's gonna be pretty

634
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,050
power button mm-hmm it's gonna be pretty
 

635
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,040
power button mm-hmm it's gonna be pretty
cool yeah it from Amazon I got the

636
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,050
cool yeah it from Amazon I got the

665
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,160
of stock and waited for a while and I
got fed up and watered him Amazon's got

666

got fed up and watered him Amazon's got
 

667
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,640
got fed up and watered him Amazon's got
buying power though an Amazon will have

668
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:03,650
buying power though an Amazon will have
 

669
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,960
buying power though an Amazon will have
will warehouse enough of them that the

670
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:05,970
will warehouse enough of them that the
 

671
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,620
will warehouse enough of them that the
price is lower right so it's kind of

672
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:09,630
price is lower right so it's kind of
 

673
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,810
price is lower right so it's kind of
worth waiting but that's good that you

674
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:11,820
worth waiting but that's good that you
 

675
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,100
worth waiting but that's good that you
got one coming anyway it looks like a

676
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,110
got one coming anyway it looks like a
 

677
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,730
got one coming anyway it looks like a
really sleek case you got the 8 gig

678
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:15,740
really sleek case you got the 8 gig
 

679
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,279
really sleek case you got the 8 gig
Raspberry Pi yes they do

680
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:19,289
Raspberry Pi yes they do
 

681
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,650
Raspberry Pi yes they do
I've heard they're having trouble with

682
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:21,660
I've heard they're having trouble with
 

683
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,659
I've heard they're having trouble with
supply and demand

684
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:23,669
supply and demand
 

685
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:26,939
supply and demand
because all of us geeks decided to buy

686
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:26,949
because all of us geeks decided to buy
 

687
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,640
because all of us geeks decided to buy
one or multiple the day that they were

688
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:29,650
one or multiple the day that they were
 

689
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,279
one or multiple the day that they were
released yeah it was something to do

690
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:32,289
released yeah it was something to do
 

691
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,409
released yeah it was something to do
while we're still in true

692
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:34,419
while we're still in true
 

693
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,840

but and and Beckham made mention of it

696
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:38,620
but and and Beckham made mention of it
 

697
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,380
but and and Beckham made mention of it
on the news this week and one of the

698
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:40,390
on the news this week and one of the
 

699
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,200
on the news this week and one of the
comments was really valid is is that it

700
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,210
comments was really valid is is that it
 

701
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,610
comments was really valid is is that it
looks like raspberry pie is actually

702
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:44,620
looks like raspberry pie is actually
 

703
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,400
looks like raspberry pie is actually
going on going after the low-end desktop

704
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,410
going on going after the low-end desktop
 

705
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,760
going on going after the low-end desktop
market which is really an interesting I

706
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:52,770
market which is really an interesting I
 

707
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,779
market which is really an interesting I
think it's still a little underpowered

708
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:54,789
think it's still a little underpowered
 

709
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:58,020
think it's still a little underpowered
CPU wise like the SOC itself oh no what

710
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,030
CPU wise like the SOC itself oh no what
 

711
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,520
CPU wise like the SOC itself oh no what
do you think Marsh man how have you

712
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,530
do you think Marsh man how have you
 

713
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,399
do you think Marsh man how have you
found it I that is perfect for the

714
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:02,409
found it I that is perfect for the
 

715
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:05,450
found it I that is perfect for the
low-end market right there yes yeah that

716
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,460
low-end market right there yes yeah that
 

717
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,430
low-end market right there yes yeah that
if this is the device this is the one

718
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:08,440
if this is the device this is the one
 

719
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,529
if this is the device this is the one
for sure mm-hmm

720
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:10,539
for sure mm-hmm
 

721
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:13,680
for sure mm-hmm
I have only been running MEMS on on the

722
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:13,690
I have only been running MEMS on on the
 

723
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,490
I have only been running MEMS on on the
8 gig so far okay yeah as we you know

724
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:17,500
8 gig so far okay yeah as we you know
 

725
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,470
8 gig so far okay yeah as we you know
you're in into a couple of snags during

726
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:19,480
you're in into a couple of snags during
 

727
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,720
you're in into a couple of snags during
the week so I think that's all it's been

728
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:21,730
the week so I think that's all it's been
 

729
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,279
the week so I think that's all it's been
doing yeah okay honey I'm using the

730
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:26,289
doing yeah okay honey I'm using the
 

731
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,500
doing yeah okay honey I'm using the
three B plus two to do all the windows

732
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,510
three B plus two to do all the windows
 

733
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,210
three B plus two to do all the windows
testing that's cool

734
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:30,220
testing that's cool
 

735
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,360
testing that's cool

yeah so what is what Peters talking

842
00:21:59,289 --> 00:21:59,299
yeah so what is what Peters talking
 

843
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,509
yeah so what is what Peters talking
about is he showed this in our discord

844
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:01,519
about is he showed this in our discord
 

845
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,989
about is he showed this in our discord
he's built a sine wave generator oh

846
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:06,999
he's built a sine wave generator oh
 

847
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:11,440
he's built a sine wave generator oh
you've got it with you you know just rip

848
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,450
you've got it with you you know just rip
 

849
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,999
you've got it with you you know just rip
off your headset and throw it on the

850
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:13,009
off your headset and throw it on the
 

851
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:13,570
off your headset and throw it on the
ground

852

ground
 

853
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:35,680
ground
come on so he's gonna with the Raspberry

854
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:35,690
come on so he's gonna with the Raspberry
 

855
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,690
come on so he's gonna with the Raspberry
Pi he's got four buttons on the front of

856
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:37,700
Pi he's got four buttons on the front of
 

857
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,739
Pi he's got four buttons on the front of
this thing and he's gonna be able to

858
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:38,749
this thing and he's gonna be able to
 

859
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:40,149
this thing and he's gonna be able to
push it and it's gonna interact with the

860
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
push it and it's gonna interact with the
 

861
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,210
push it and it's gonna interact with the
GPIO and then it's gonna control this

862
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,220
GPIO and then it's gonna control this
 

863
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,950
GPIO and then it's gonna control this
circuit that he's designed to be able to

864
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
circuit that he's designed to be able to
 

865
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,310
circuit that he's designed to be able to
create the sine waves yeah that's cool

866
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,320
create the sine waves yeah that's cool
 

867
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,049
create the sine waves yeah that's cool
it's way it's what I say it's cool it's

868
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:50,059
it's way it's what I say it's cool it's
 

869
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:50,950
it's way it's what I say it's cool it's
way beyond me

870
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:50,960
way beyond me
 

871
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,940
way beyond me
it's like I'm I'm down here you're up

872
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:54,950
it's like I'm I'm down here you're up
 

873
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,700
it's like I'm I'm down here you're up
there Jane Jim I think you're Lincoln

would make you know I I'm just being

878
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:05,299
would make you know I I'm just being
 

879
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,210
would make you know I I'm just being
honest that I don't understand any of it

880
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:07,220
honest that I don't understand any of it
 

881
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,850
honest that I don't understand any of it
but I like it and I want it I want to

882
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:09,860
but I like it and I want it I want to
 

883
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,210
but I like it and I want it I want to
learn how to do like more like like my

884
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,220
learn how to do like more like like my
 

885
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,909
learn how to do like more like like my
circuits my circuits are like relays

886
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
circuits my circuits are like relays
 

887
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,100
circuits my circuits are like relays
I'll do a circuit that's just a relay

888
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,110
I'll do a circuit that's just a relay
 

889
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,710
I'll do a circuit that's just a relay
and an LED and that's about that's the

890
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
and an LED and that's about that's the
 

891
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:29,590
and an LED and that's about that's the
level that I'm adding lights go on now

892
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
level that I'm adding lights go on now
 

893
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,629
level that I'm adding lights go on now
if I can make them go on and off and on

894
00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:31,639
if I can make them go on and off and on
 

895
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,639
if I can make them go on and off and on
and off on a schedule oh you guys want

896
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:33,649
and off on a schedule oh you guys want
 

897
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:38,139
and off on a schedule oh you guys want
to know what I did remember how oh if

898
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:38,149
to know what I did remember how oh if
 

899
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,769
to know what I did remember how oh if
you saw the feature the QA on mikrotik

900
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:41,779
you saw the feature the QA on mikrotik
 

901
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,739
you saw the feature the QA on mikrotik
hmm I actually set our guest Wi-Fi to

902
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:44,749
hmm I actually set our guest Wi-Fi to
 

903
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:47,080
hmm I actually set our guest Wi-Fi to
automatically turn off during

904
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,090
automatically turn off during
 

905
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,039
automatically turn off during
non-business hours no so on the mikrotik

906
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,049
non-business hours no so on the mikrotik
 

907
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:52,690
non-business hours no so on the mikrotik
I've got it on a schedule so that the

908
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:52,700
I've got it on a schedule so that the
 

909
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,760
I've got it on a schedule so that the
guest Wi-Fi is not on 24/7 it's only on

910
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:55,770
guest Wi-Fi is not on 24/7 it's only on
 

911
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,820
guest Wi-Fi is not on 24/7 it's only on
should be in use so people can't use it

912
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:58,830
should be in use so people can't use it
 

913
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,910
should be in use so people can't use it
after hours and stuff so the reason I

914
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:01,920
after hours and stuff so the reason I
 

915
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,860
after hours and stuff so the reason I
asked you a while ago rob you about

916
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:03,870
asked you a while ago rob you about
 

917
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,540
asked you a while ago rob you about
running one microchip grabba and who

918
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,550
running one microchip grabba and who
 

919
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,750
running one microchip grabba and who
internet modems yeah that's a pretty

920
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
internet modems yeah that's a pretty
 

921
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,620
internet modems yeah that's a pretty
normal

922
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:12,630
normal
 

923
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,920
normal
yeah configuration do like a failover

924
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:15,930
yeah configuration do like a failover
 

925
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,620
yeah configuration do like a failover
internet so what we all I do or just let

926
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:18,630
internet so what we all I do or just let
 

927
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,630
internet so what we all I do or just let
it every at real-time pick the best part

928
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
it every at real-time pick the best part
 

929
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
it every at real-time pick the best part
figure out which is the best moment to

930
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,410
figure out which is the best moment to
 

931
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,980
figure out which is the best moment to
use for you typically we want a hat we

932
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:24,990
use for you typically we want a hat we
 

933
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,380
use for you typically we want a hat we
want to say the fastest one is always

934
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,390
want to say the fastest one is always
 

935
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,330
want to say the fastest one is always
the default because you don't want your

936
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:29,340
the default because you don't want your
 

937
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,040
the default because you don't want your
IP address changing all the time you're

938
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,050
IP address changing all the time you're
 

939
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,960
IP address changing all the time you're
gonna get routing problems and you're

940
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:32,970
gonna get routing problems and you're
 

941
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,700
gonna get routing problems and you're
gonna and then you're gonna like your

942
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:34,710
gonna and then you're gonna like your
 

943
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,320
gonna and then you're gonna like your
sessions are gonna change every time the

944
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,330
sessions are gonna change every time the
 

945
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,960
sessions are gonna change every time the
IP changes and everything so we pick the

946
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:38,970
IP changes and everything so we pick the
 

947
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,570
IP changes and everything so we pick the
best path which would be the fastest

948
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:41,580
best path which would be the fastest
 

949
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,060
best path which would be the fastest
internet connection and then if that one

950
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,070
internet connection and then if that one
 

951
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,240
internet connection and then if that one
goes down then we failover to something

952
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,250
goes down then we failover to something
 

953
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,390
goes down then we failover to something
like LTE or DSL something else so that

954
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
like LTE or DSL something else so that
 

955
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,550
like LTE or DSL something else so that
there's a failover okay so that means

956
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:52,560
there's a failover okay so that means
 

957
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,800
there's a failover okay so that means
there's only ever one in service at any

958
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:54,810
there's only ever one in service at any
 

959
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,490
there's only ever one in service at any
given time that's my preference favor

960
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:58,500
given time that's my preference favor
 

961
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,810
given time that's my preference favor
you and mute that microphone you thank

962
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:02,820
you and mute that microphone you thank
 

963
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,060
you and mute that microphone you thank
you my preference my preference is to

964
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,070
you my preference my preference is to
 

965
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,660
you my preference my preference is to
have a failover but that's because

966
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:07,670
have a failover but that's because
 

967
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,000
have a failover but that's because
typically I mean internet I've got one

968
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,010
typically I mean internet I've got one
 

969
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,490
typically I mean internet I've got one
really good connection and the other one

970
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:13,500
really good connection and the other one
 

971
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,970
really good connection and the other one
is like LTE five megabits a second so I

972
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:16,980
is like LTE five megabits a second so I
 

973
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,710
is like LTE five megabits a second so I
really only want that to be so that

974
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
really only want that to be so that
 

975
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,630
really only want that to be so that
internet never goes down but I never

976
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
internet never goes down but I never
 

977
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,720
internet never goes down but I never
want it to be my normal chain right well

978
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:23,730
want it to be my normal chain right well
 

979
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,490
want it to be my normal chain right well
you've seen it you've seen it happen to

980
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:25,500
you've seen it you've seen it happen to
 

981
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,860
you've seen it you've seen it happen to
me on coffee break with you and it's

982
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:27,870
me on coffee break with you and it's
 

983
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,020
me on coffee break with you and it's
gone down once twice three times

984
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,030
gone down once twice three times
 

985
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,420
gone down once twice three times
sometimes right you know which to my

986
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,430
sometimes right you know which to my
 

987
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,640
sometimes right you know which to my
regular phone so what you need to do

988
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:34,650
regular phone so what you need to do
 

989
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,340
regular phone so what you need to do
that is you'd have to have you'd have to

990
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,350
that is you'd have to have you'd have to
 

991
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,130
that is you'd have to have you'd have to
have a oh what's the term I know it and

992
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,140
have a oh what's the term I know it and
 

993
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,330
have a oh what's the term I know it and
yes mikrotik can help you with it

994
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:43,340
yes mikrotik can help you with it
 

995
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,520
yes mikrotik can help you with it
bond bonding you have to have an

996
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:46,530
bond bonding you have to have an
 

997
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,680
bond bonding you have to have an
internet bond so you have two

998
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:48,690
internet bond so you have two
 

999
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,870
internet bond so you have two
connections that are then creating one

1000
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
connections that are then creating one
 

1001
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,130
connections that are then creating one
connection and then the router will will

1002
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,140
connection and then the router will will
 

1003
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,830
connection and then the router will will
decide where that traffic goes okay but

1004
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
decide where that traffic goes okay but
 

1005
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,690
decide where that traffic goes okay but
the problem you can run into if you're

1006
00:25:59,690 --> 00:25:59,700
the problem you can run into if you're
 

1007
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,370
the problem you can run into if you're
using like say you're using a streaming

1008
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:01,380
using like say you're using a streaming
 

1009
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,830
using like say you're using a streaming
service where like say Netflix where

1010
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
service where like say Netflix where
 

1011
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,970
service where like say Netflix where
you're authenticated on the Netflix

1012
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:04,980
you're authenticated on the Netflix
 

1013
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,740
you're authenticated on the Netflix
service or something right I don't know

1014
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:06,750
service or something right I don't know
 

1015
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,139
service or something right I don't know
how it will react to that because you

1016
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:09,149
how it will react to that because you
 

1017
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:11,599
how it will react to that because you
knows your IP address and and where you

1018
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:11,609
knows your IP address and and where you
 

1019
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:13,219
knows your IP address and and where you
are and so if all of a sudden you're on

1020
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:13,229
are and so if all of a sudden you're on
 

1021
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:15,129
are and so if all of a sudden you're on
a different IP address will that affect

1022
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:15,139
a different IP address will that affect
 

1023
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:18,259
a different IP address will that affect
things or I don't know and I would

1024
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:18,269
things or I don't know and I would
 

1025
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,719
things or I don't know and I would
imagine it session based so whatever but

1026
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:20,729
imagine it session based so whatever but
 

1027
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:22,669
imagine it session based so whatever but
yeah program ease it would be it would

1028
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:22,679
yeah program ease it would be it would
 

1029
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,409
yeah program ease it would be it would
have established the session probably

1030
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:24,419
have established the session probably
 

1031
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,259
have established the session probably
can't imagine no matter but I agree I

1032
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:27,269
can't imagine no matter but I agree I
 

1033
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:30,109
can't imagine no matter but I agree I
makes me I don't know that I want to pay

1034
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:30,119
makes me I don't know that I want to pay
 

1035
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,479
makes me I don't know that I want to pay
for a whole new internet service and

1036
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:32,489
for a whole new internet service and
 

1037
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,099
for a whole new internet service and
have to coming to the house just on the

1038
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:34,109
have to coming to the house just on the
 

1039
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,889
have to coming to the house just on the
off chance that I have to here I have to

1040
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:36,899
off chance that I have to here I have to
 

1041
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,919
off chance that I have to here I have to
here and I'm only using one but they but

1042
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:39,929
here and I'm only using one but they but
 

1043
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:42,109
here and I'm only using one but they but
provided by the same internet provider

1044
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:42,119
provided by the same internet provider
 

1045
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,969
provided by the same internet provider
well I have no I have a cellular

1046
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:43,979
well I have no I have a cellular
 

1047
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,180
well I have no I have a cellular
connection and I have the coax so I'm

1048
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,190
connection and I have the coax so I'm
 

1049
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,129
connection and I have the coax so I'm
only running on the coax cuz I'm like

1050
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:49,139
only running on the coax cuz I'm like
 

1051
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:51,739
only running on the coax cuz I'm like
yeah the cellular was just too slow I

1052
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:51,749
yeah the cellular was just too slow I
 

1053
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:53,329
yeah the cellular was just too slow I
didn't didn't want to go to the effort

1054
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:53,339
didn't didn't want to go to the effort
 

1055
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:56,299
didn't didn't want to go to the effort
I might connect it but yeah use it as a

1056
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:56,309
I might connect it but yeah use it as a
 

1057
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:57,499
I might connect it but yeah use it as a
failover but I'd hate to be in the

1058
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:57,509
failover but I'd hate to be in the
 

1059
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:58,969
failover but I'd hate to be in the
middle of a show and all of a sudden be

1060
00:26:58,969 --> 00:26:58,979
middle of a show and all of a sudden be
 

1061
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:05,570
middle of a show and all of a sudden be
and finally if it's a second you say

1062
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:05,580
and finally if it's a second you say
 

1063
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,489
and finally if it's a second you say
that but when you're streaming 2k video

1064
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:07,499
that but when you're streaming 2k video
 

1065
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:13,430
that but when you're streaming 2k video
not so much you'd rather it go down yeah

1066
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,440
not so much you'd rather it go down yeah
 

1067
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,709
not so much you'd rather it go down yeah
so I'm trying to decide if it's worth my

1068
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:15,719
so I'm trying to decide if it's worth my
 

1069
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:19,479
so I'm trying to decide if it's worth my
while to just bring for another service

1070
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:19,489
while to just bring for another service
 

1071
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:22,519
while to just bring for another service
the only two options I have here how

1072
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:22,529
the only two options I have here how
 

1073
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:24,529
the only two options I have here how
often does it go down well that's the

1074
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:24,539
often does it go down well that's the
 

1075
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,089
often does it go down well that's the
key right that's the thing it's just not

1076
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:26,099
key right that's the thing it's just not
 

1077
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:28,820
key right that's the thing it's just not
often enough yeah but it just it's it's

1078
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:28,830
often enough yeah but it just it's it's
 

1079
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,219
often enough yeah but it just it's it's
either when I'm streaming YouTube or

1080
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:31,229
either when I'm streaming YouTube or
 

1081
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:34,489
either when I'm streaming YouTube or
streaming Netflix yeah but it doesn't

1082
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:34,499
streaming Netflix yeah but it doesn't
 

1083
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:36,409
streaming Netflix yeah but it doesn't
happen often enough it's just enough to

1084
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:36,419
happen often enough it's just enough to
 

1085
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,959
happen often enough it's just enough to
annoy me but not enough to write look to

1086
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:38,969
annoy me but not enough to write look to
 

1087
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:41,289
annoy me but not enough to write look to
make me do any anything about yeah so

1088
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:41,299
make me do any anything about yeah so
 

1089
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:44,450
make me do any anything about yeah so
but I was trying to figure out if the

1090
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:44,460
but I was trying to figure out if the
 

1091
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,310
but I was trying to figure out if the
mikrotik would would help me with that

1092
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
mikrotik would would help me with that
 

1093
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,399
mikrotik would would help me with that
attempt like it can but what I thought

1094
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:49,409
attempt like it can but what I thought
 

1095
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:52,099
attempt like it can but what I thought
it would do is is just on the fly pick

1096
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:52,109
it would do is is just on the fly pick
 

1097
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:56,389
it would do is is just on the fly pick
which is the best path to use but you're

1098
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
which is the best path to use but you're
 

1099
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,219
which is the best path to use but you're
right did not think of those other room

1100
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:58,229
right did not think of those other room
 

1101
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:02,450
right did not think of those other room
those other corns yeah mine because my

1102
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:02,460
those other corns yeah mine because my
 

1103
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,399
those other corns yeah mine because my
router has that as that option of two

1104
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:04,409
router has that as that option of two
 

1105
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:12,019
router has that as that option of two
wins to services coming in so so you

1106
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:12,029
wins to services coming in so so you
 

1107
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,639
wins to services coming in so so you
look at a micro tech if it has five

1108
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:13,649
look at a micro tech if it has five
 

1109
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:16,129
look at a micro tech if it has five
ports you you can actually set what each

1110
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:16,139
ports you you can actually set what each
 

1111
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:18,289
ports you you can actually set what each
of those ports are so it comes by

1112
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:18,299
of those ports are so it comes by
 

1113
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,390
of those ports are so it comes by
default as port one as your wand

1114
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:20,400
default as port one as your wand
 

1115
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,310
default as port one as your wand
or but you could have you could set

1116
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
or but you could have you could set
 

1117
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,890
or but you could have you could set
three of them as one ports and then and

1118
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:24,900
three of them as one ports and then and
 

1119
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,080
three of them as one ports and then and
then you can bridge them yeah and you

1120
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,090
then you can bridge them yeah and you
 

1121
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,860
then you can bridge them yeah and you
can create a bonded Network but that's

1122
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:30,870
can create a bonded Network but that's
 

1123
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,480
can create a bonded Network but that's
beyond anything I've ever done I just

1124
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:32,490
beyond anything I've ever done I just
 

1125
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,120
beyond anything I've ever done I just
have done failover so that if the first

1126
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,130
have done failover so that if the first
 

1127
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,880
have done failover so that if the first
you know I prioritize the first one is

1128
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:37,890
you know I prioritize the first one is
 

1129
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,230
you know I prioritize the first one is
the best one so if it ever goes down

1130
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:39,240
the best one so if it ever goes down
 

1131
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,170
the best one so if it ever goes down
move to the second one and then if the

1132
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,180
move to the second one and then if the
 

1133
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,850
move to the second one and then if the
first one comes back up moved back to

1134
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:43,860
first one comes back up moved back to
 

1135
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
first one comes back up moved back to
the first one which fight which would

1136
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:45,870
the first one which fight which would
 

1137
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,840
the first one which fight which would
work but again as you say even zoom

1138
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:47,850
work but again as you say even zoom
 

1139
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,950
work but again as you say even zoom
might get cranky

1140
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
might get cranky
 

1141
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,720
might get cranky
it might yeah you're gonna have that

1142
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:50,730
it might yeah you're gonna have that
 

1143
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,300
it might yeah you're gonna have that
hiccup as you change services yeah it'll

1144
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,310
hiccup as you change services yeah it'll
 

1145
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,700
hiccup as you change services yeah it'll
it'll be momentary but yeah which case

1146
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:55,710
it'll be momentary but yeah which case
 

1147
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,770
it'll be momentary but yeah which case
my outages are usually just a few

1148
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:57,780
my outages are usually just a few
 

1149
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,220
my outages are usually just a few
minutes

1150
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,230
minutes
 

1151
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,710
minutes
yeah often they're not often longer than

1152
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
yeah often they're not often longer than
 

1153
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,990
yeah often they're not often longer than
that not enough that I would just shut

1154
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,000
that not enough that I would just shut
 

1155
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,720
that not enough that I would just shut
it off and be done with it but it's the

1156
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:05,730
it off and be done with it but it's the
 

1157
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,400
it off and be done with it but it's the
frequency of the Attic just that

1158
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,410
frequency of the Attic just that
 

1159
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,040
frequency of the Attic just that
what gets me that when I was when I got

1160
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,050
what gets me that when I was when I got
 

1161
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,020
what gets me that when I was when I got
knocked off three times off of a zoom

1162
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,030
knocked off three times off of a zoom
 

1163
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,600
knocked off three times off of a zoom
I'm done with this and I fired up my

1164
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:14,610
I'm done with this and I fired up my
 

1165
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,830
I'm done with this and I fired up my
phone as a hotspot you've been rated

1166
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
phone as a hotspot you've been rated
 

1167
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,930
phone as a hotspot you've been rated
rock steady ever themes as a final

1168
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:20,940
rock steady ever themes as a final
 

1169
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,030
rock steady ever themes as a final
thought then you set your phone as a

1170
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,040
thought then you set your phone as a
 

1171
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,430
thought then you set your phone as a
hotspot and then you create a Wi-Fi

1172
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
hotspot and then you create a Wi-Fi
 

1173
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,390
hotspot and then you create a Wi-Fi
connection from your mikrotik to your

1174
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:29,400
connection from your mikrotik to your
 

1175
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,060
connection from your mikrotik to your
Wi-Fi hotspot on your phone okay and

1176
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,070
Wi-Fi hotspot on your phone okay and
 

1177
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,790
Wi-Fi hotspot on your phone okay and
then you share that as a bridge to your

1178
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:34,800
then you share that as a bridge to your
 

1179
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,870
then you share that as a bridge to your
network so now you're no now your land

1180
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
network so now you're no now your land
 

1181
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,610
network so now you're no now your land
can connect through your cell phone's

1182
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:40,620
can connect through your cell phone's
 

1183
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,800
can connect through your cell phone's
connection and in fact that's a great

1184
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:42,810
connection and in fact that's a great
 

1185
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,540
connection and in fact that's a great
way to be able to extend your Wi-Fi in
