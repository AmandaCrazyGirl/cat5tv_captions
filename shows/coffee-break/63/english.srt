00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,320
the printer so what he's done is he's
made what looks like like a tube but

312
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,330
made what looks like like a tube but
 

313
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,149
made what looks like like a tube but
with a bit of a flange on the outside

314
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:27,159
with a bit of a flange on the outside
 

315
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,100
with a bit of a flange on the outside
and you put that through the hole that

316
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,110
and you put that through the hole that
 

317
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,110
and you put that through the hole that
I've drilled in the wall and then from

318
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
I've drilled in the wall and then from
 

319
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,670
I've drilled in the wall and then from
the other side you come back with

320
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:32,680
the other side you come back with
 

321
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,579
the other side you come back with
another one and they screw together so

322
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:35,589
another one and they screw together so
 

323
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,639
another one and they screw together so
now on both sides of the wall you've got

324
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:37,649
now on both sides of the wall you've got
 

325
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,040
now on both sides of the wall you've got
basically a passage to get the cables

326
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,050
basically a passage to get the cables
 

327
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,290
basically a passage to get the cables
through that's not a big stretch of PVC

328
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:43,300
through that's not a big stretch of PVC
 

329
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,810
through that's not a big stretch of PVC
and it looks like just a proper hole in

330
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:45,820
and it looks like just a proper hole in
 

331
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,280
and it looks like just a proper hole in
the wall but it has

332
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,290
the wall but it has
 

333
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,680
the wall but it has
because it's a tube it's nothing is

334
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:49,690
because it's a tube it's nothing is
 

335
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,230
because it's a tube it's nothing is
making contact with the drywall so and

336
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
making contact with the drywall so and
 

337
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,970
making contact with the drywall so and
you know you could have cut that PVC

338
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:53,980

you know you could have cut that PVC
down to like six inches or something

340
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,290
down to like six inches or something
 

341
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,360
down to like six inches or something
instead of it but then I just don't I'm

342
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,370
instead of it but then I just don't I'm
 

343
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,670
instead of it but then I just don't I'm

558
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:46,770
had to find a USB Drive to put it on and
 

559
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,920
had to find a USB Drive to put it on and
I installed it from a USB Drive yeah and

560
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:50,930
I installed it from a USB Drive yeah and
 

561
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,060
I installed it from a USB Drive yeah and
then I realized I couldn't play the

562
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,070
then I realized I couldn't play the
 

563
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,680
then I realized I couldn't play the
games I wanted to play out of boot too

564
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:54,690
games I wanted to play out of boot too
 

565
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:01,070
games I wanted to play out of boot too
so I went back to Windows No yeah that

566
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,080
so I went back to Windows No yeah that
 

567
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,440
so I went back to Windows No yeah that
was crazy you could do a dual boot I

568
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,450
was crazy you could do a dual boot I
 

569
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,150
was crazy you could do a dual boot I
would I would consider a dual boot

570
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,160
would I would consider a dual boot
 

571
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,010
would I would consider a dual boot
environment in a case like that if you

572
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,020
environment in a case like that if you
 

573
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,660
environment in a case like that if you
really needed Windows for something

574
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:08,670
really needed Windows for something
 

575
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,250
really needed Windows for something
because then at least you could get back

576
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:10,260
because then at least you could get back
 

577
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,590
because then at least you could get back
into linear or like using the web and

578
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:12,600
into linear or like using the web and
 

579
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,270
into linear or like using the web and
those kinds of things like your yeah

580
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:14,280
those kinds of things like your yeah
 

581
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,690
those kinds of things like your yeah
that's true yeah what a few people are

582
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:17,700
that's true yeah what a few people are
 

583
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:26,380
that's true yeah what a few people are
doing and even a few games they have an

bit of like lag with the mouse or
 

601
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,350
bit of like lag with the mouse or
something like that really installed

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,360
something like that really installed
 

603
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,220
something like that really installed
Linux and then he installed the windows

604
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,230
Linux and then he installed the windows
 

605
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,650
Linux and then he installed the windows
in a virtual machine and then windows in

606
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:00,660
in a virtual machine and then windows in
 

607
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,840
in a virtual machine and then windows in
the virtual machine was faster than it

608
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:02,850
the virtual machine was faster than it
 

609
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,829
the virtual machine was faster than it
ever was yeah you still don't get access

610
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:06,839
ever was yeah you still don't get access
 

611
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,500
ever was yeah you still don't get access
to the heart whether right but if it

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,250
works for you though it's sitting on a
non fragmenting filesystem so even

616
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,260
non fragmenting filesystem so even
 

617
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,470
non fragmenting filesystem so even
though NTFS will fragment itself the

618
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:15,480
though NTFS will fragment itself the
 

619
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,780
though NTFS will fragment itself the

my box of tricks of screws we have like

690
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,240
my box of tricks of screws we have like
 

691
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,240
my box of tricks of screws we have like
torque and a few others they started as

the m3 though when I got the vim 3 with

698
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:31,790
the m3 though when I got the vim 3 with
 

699
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,700
the m3 though when I got the vim 3 with
the case and everything it came with a

700
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:33,710
the case and everything it came with a
 

701
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,040
the case and everything it came with a
little tiny screwdriver that has an

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,050
little tiny screwdriver that has an
 

703
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,260

orange handle and that was that was the
 

705
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,030
orange handle and that was that was the
triangular thing so I actually took a

706
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,040
triangular thing so I actually took a
 

707
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,440
triangular thing so I actually took a
sharpie and I wrote

708
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,450
sharpie and I wrote
 

709
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,039
sharpie and I wrote
then three on it so I have it somewhere

710
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,049
then three on it so I have it somewhere
 

711
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,070
then three on it so I have it somewhere

worst part
it gets better heatsink

734
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:19,159
it gets better heatsink
 

735
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,730
it gets better heatsink
you screw you start the screw and it

736
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:21,740

an m2 to an M 1.5 what that and yeah how
 

747
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,259
an m2 to an M 1.5 what that and yeah how
do you attach it to the board so I had a

748
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:38,269
do you attach it to the board so I had a
 

749
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,799
do you attach it to the board so I had a
cake I had to take a pin vise and put a

cake I had to take a pin vise and put a
drill bit in it and and manually drill

752
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:44,179
drill bit in it and and manually drill
 

753

zoom in for these folks so that we can
 

763
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:06,009
zoom in for these folks so that we can
see it a little better together and this

see it a little better together and this
 

765
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:08,430
see it a little better together and this
is actually a Raspberry Pi acrylic case

766
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:08,440
is actually a Raspberry Pi acrylic case
 

767
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,200
is actually a Raspberry Pi acrylic case
see all these extra screw holes here I

768
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,210
see all these extra screw holes here I
 

769
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,200
see all these extra screw holes here I
had a drill holes in the acrylic because

770
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,210
had a drill holes in the acrylic because
 

771
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,200
had a drill holes in the acrylic because
them three holes don't line up with

772
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,210
them three holes don't line up with
 

773
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,759
them three holes don't line up with
anything else on the planet they're just

774
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:21,769
anything else on the planet they're just
 

775
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:33,039
anything else on the planet they're just

dude well I'm still trying to solve the

792
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:01,870
dude well I'm still trying to solve the
 

793
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,700
dude well I'm still trying to solve the
puzzle of the of the I don't know if you

794
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,710
puzzle of the of the I don't know if you
 

795
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,340
puzzle of the of the I don't know if you
can see it the same thing I can pin your

796
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,350
can see it the same thing I can pin your
 

797
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,450
can see it the same thing I can pin your
video so Oh sure that'll work yeah so

798
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:12,460
video so Oh sure that'll work yeah so
 

799
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,860
video so Oh sure that'll work yeah so
you got the white oh and then your video

800
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:13,870
you got the white oh and then your video
 

801
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,090
you got the white oh and then your video

804
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:21,399
white areas oh I'm back yeah okay I
 

805
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,940
white areas oh I'm back yeah okay I
don't see myself on the display though

806
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:23,950
don't see myself on the display though
 

807
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,120
don't see myself on the display though
I've got the funky-looking them and your

808
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,130
I've got the funky-looking them and your
 

809
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,070
I've got the funky-looking them and your
cameras doing what our exposure to by

810
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,080
cameras doing what our exposure to by
 

811
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:37,680
cameras doing what our exposure to by
the way yeah just on a webcam I hooked

812
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:37,690
the way yeah just on a webcam I hooked
 

813
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,590
the way yeah just on a webcam I hooked
up a webcam to the okay for the server

814
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:40,600
up a webcam to the okay for the server
 

815
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,590
up a webcam to the okay for the server
in the in this room here so so I think I

816
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
in the in this room here so so I think I
 

817
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,269
in the in this room here so so I think I
don't know if you can see it I'm gonna

818
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:45,279
don't know if you can see it I'm gonna
 

819
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,060
don't know if you can see it I'm gonna
jump to my view so that I can see it

820
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,070
jump to my view so that I can see it
 

821
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,529
jump to my view so that I can see it
better but the I don't know if that's

822
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:52,539
better but the I don't know if that's
 

823
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,509
better but the I don't know if that's
even in focus because I don't think the

824
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:54,519
even in focus because I don't think the
 

825
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:57,629
even in focus because I don't think the
camera is wanting to focus very well but

826
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:57,639
camera is wanting to focus very well but
 

827
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:01,500
camera is wanting to focus very well but
if you look with auto exposure well so

828
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,510
if you look with auto exposure well so
 

829
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,539
if you look with auto exposure well so
quick the phone just has what it has you

830
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:03,549
quick the phone just has what it has you
 

831
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,570
quick the phone just has what it has you
know it's focusing on my face but not on

832
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:06,580
know it's focusing on my face but not on
 

833
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,870
know it's focusing on my face but not on
what if I give that does that help could

834
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:09,880
what if I give that does that help could
 

835
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,659
what if I give that does that help could
you maybe if you drew a smiley way you

836
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:12,669
you maybe if you drew a smiley way you
 

837
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:17,070
you maybe if you drew a smiley way you
drew a smiley on the intercept

838
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,080

 

839
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,639

there's a picture of it anyway good

840
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:23,649
there's a picture of it anyway good
 

841
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,200
there's a picture of it anyway good
you'll see it you'll see a much better

842
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,210
you'll see it you'll see a much better
 

843
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,509
you'll see it you'll see a much better
picture than what I can do yeah yeah but

844
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:27,519
picture than what I can do yeah yeah but
 

845
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,820
picture than what I can do yeah yeah but
those those four holes that are spaced

846
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:29,830
those those four holes that are spaced
 

847
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,279
those those four holes that are spaced
very closely together I did a bunch of

848
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:32,289
very closely together I did a bunch of
 

849
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:36,060
very closely together I did a bunch of
research on the on the point 64 site and

850
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,070
research on the on the point 64 site and
 

851
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,060
research on the on the point 64 site and
on other sites that it branches off to a

852
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,070
on other sites that it branches off to a
 

853
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,250
on other sites that it branches off to a
fella by the name of luck young I think

854
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,260
fella by the name of luck young I think
 

855
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,639
fella by the name of luck young I think
his name is he's from Hong Kong I think

856
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:46,649
his name is he's from Hong Kong I think
 

857
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:49,560
his name is he's from Hong Kong I think
and he's been doing a lot of work on on

858
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:49,570
and he's been doing a lot of work on on
 

859
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,789
and he's been doing a lot of work on on
these on these Rutter I am fine times

860
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:53,799
these on these Rutter I am fine times
 

861
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,299
these on these Rutter I am fine times
yeah and he says that he does not use

862
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:57,309
yeah and he says that he does not use
 

863
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:59,760
yeah and he says that he does not use
the original programming cable that came

864
00:23:59,760 --> 00:23:59,770
the original programming cable that came
 

865
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,710
the original programming cable that came
with all the fine time

866
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:01,720
with all the fine time
 

867
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,930
with all the fine time
because the pins are too small they

868
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:03,940
because the pins are too small they
 

869
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,480
because the pins are too small they
make a reliable connection so you said

870
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,490
make a reliable connection so you said
 

871
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,289
make a reliable connection so you said
your best bet is to go is to go get some

872
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:09,299
your best bet is to go is to go get some
 

873
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,110
your best bet is to go is to go get some
AWG 22 so 22 gauge wire little bit

874
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
AWG 22 so 22 gauge wire little bit
 

875
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,840
AWG 22 so 22 gauge wire little bit
thicker than these pins and will work a

876
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:15,850
thicker than these pins and will work a
 

877
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,480
thicker than these pins and will work a
little more reliably so when you take

878
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,490
little more reliably so when you take
 

879
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,450
little more reliably so when you take
them spear having held that like if I

880
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:21,460
them spear having held that like if I
 

881
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,180
them spear having held that like if I
was to tin the cable the kind of tines

882
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,190
was to tin the cable the kind of tines
 

883
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,249
was to tin the cable the kind of tines
that I'm gonna take that 22 gauge wire

884
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:29,259
that I'm gonna take that 22 gauge wire
 

885
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,460
that I'm gonna take that 22 gauge wire
and I'm gonna tin it so it'll be solid

886
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:32,470
and I'm gonna tin it so it'll be solid
 

887
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,759
and I'm gonna tin it so it'll be solid
strand not not not stranded right and

888
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:35,769
strand not not not stranded right and
 

889
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,289
strand not not not stranded right and
also be just a little bit thicker and

890
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:37,299
also be just a little bit thicker and
 

891
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:39,180
also be just a little bit thicker and
I'm hoping I don't put so much solder on

892
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,190
I'm hoping I don't put so much solder on
 

893
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,769
I'm hoping I don't put so much solder on
then it's tricky to put in there

894
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:40,779
then it's tricky to put in there
 

895
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:51,169
then it's tricky to put in there
I really in the clinic the whole

896
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:51,179

 

897
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:57,570

tablespoon for flux so I'm not gonna

898
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:57,580
tablespoon for flux so I'm not gonna
 

899
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,090
tablespoon for flux so I'm not gonna
solve it the the wires in place I just

900
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,100
solve it the the wires in place I just
 

901
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,820
solve it the the wires in place I just
don't want to do that because and the

902
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:02,830
don't want to do that because and the
 

903
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,619
don't want to do that because and the
fact is that if I want to get this to a

904
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:04,629
fact is that if I want to get this to a
 

905
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,049
fact is that if I want to get this to a
point where I can program it and use it

906
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:07,059
point where I can program it and use it
 

907
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,210
point where I can program it and use it
I'm gonna have to wear it at some point

908
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,220
I'm gonna have to wear it at some point
 

909
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,789
I'm gonna have to wear it at some point
so I want to ultimately avoid doing that

910
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:11,799
so I want to ultimately avoid doing that
 

911
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,419
so I want to ultimately avoid doing that
yeah ultimately avoid tearing it up to a

912
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:15,429
yeah ultimately avoid tearing it up to a
 

913
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:19,440
yeah ultimately avoid tearing it up to a
point where I can't wear it so and if

914
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,450
point where I can't wear it so and if
 

915
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,509
point where I can't wear it so and if
not this unit then whatever other unit I

916
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:21,519
not this unit then whatever other unit I
 

917
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,100
not this unit then whatever other unit I
am that end up getting after all

918
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,110
am that end up getting after all
 

919
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,440
am that end up getting after all
ultimately my plan is to wear the thing

920
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,450
ultimately my plan is to wear the thing
 

921
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,600
ultimately my plan is to wear the thing
so yeah I'll probably break it anyway

922
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:27,610
so yeah I'll probably break it anyway
 

923
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,070
so yeah I'll probably break it anyway
because anything I put on my wrist I can

924
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,080
because anything I put on my wrist I can
 

925
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,070
because anything I put on my wrist I can
to tear up in any case so yeah you know

926
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
to tear up in any case so yeah you know
 

927
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,710
to tear up in any case so yeah you know
it is what it is arise you still haven't
