00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
hypervisor went down so that took down
 

329
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,220
hypervisor went down so that took down
my piehole so there was no DNS

330
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,230
my piehole so there was no DNS
 

331
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,770
my piehole so there was no DNS
so I couldn't I couldn't remote into the

studio my computer was off everything
 

335
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,930
studio my computer was off everything
was down and so no need to get that UPS

things where I know that I have to I got
to replace the UPS battery because it's

344
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,300
to replace the UPS battery because it's
 

345
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,960
to replace the UPS battery because it's
not holding a charge but it's not cheap

346
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:08,970
not holding a charge but it's not cheap
 

347
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,200
not holding a charge but it's not cheap
but these are industrial 1500 volt amp

348
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,210
but these are industrial 1500 volt amp
 

349
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,230
but these are industrial 1500 volt amp
ups is like you can buy three consumer

350
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,240
ups is like you can buy three consumer
 

351
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,840
ups is like you can buy three consumer
UPS's for the cost of replacing the

352
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:17,850
UPS's for the cost of replacing the
 

353
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,060
UPS's for the cost of replacing the
batteries but it's got to be a battery

354
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,070
batteries but it's got to be a battery
 

355
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,700
batteries but it's got to be a battery
replacement so it's kind of brutal so it

356
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:22,710
replacement so it's kind of brutal so it

this through the move you guys I think
 

361
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,950
this through the move you guys I think
know this especially those on

of these little unexpected that cost
that cost a lot of money the cables to

368
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:36,780
that cost a lot of money the cables to
 

369
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,410
that cost a lot of money the cables to
get stuff from this room into the other

370
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
get stuff from this room into the other
 

371
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,380
get stuff from this room into the other
room have been like unbelievably

372
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:42,390
room have been like unbelievably
 

373
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,930
room have been like unbelievably
expensive my webcam right now is plugged

374
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:44,940
expensive my webcam right now is plugged
 

375
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,810
expensive my webcam right now is plugged
into a sixty dollar USB extension

376
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:47,820
into a sixty dollar USB extension
 

377
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,940
into a sixty dollar USB extension
because it's got to be able to reach the

378
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:49,950
because it's got to be able to reach the
 

379
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,110
because it's got to be able to reach the
server in the other room well that's

380
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
server in the other room well that's
 

381
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,520
server in the other room well that's
just so that I have USB in here so and

382
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,530
just so that I have USB in here so and
 

383
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,190
just so that I have USB in here so and
then as soon as I want to have zoom

means I've got to run audio into the
 

389
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,970
means I've got to run audio into the
other room too so that costs like a

390
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:04,980
other room too so that costs like a
 

391
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,170
other room too so that costs like a
hundred and fifty bucks for that one

392
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,180
hundred and fifty bucks for that one
 

393
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,500
hundred and fifty bucks for that one
probably so there viola future right

394
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,510
probably so there viola future right
 

395
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,120
probably so there viola future right
just feels like it's like I know it's it

396
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,130
just feels like it's like I know it's it
 

397
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:24,860
just feels like it's like I know it's it
it's not a money pit and it's like oh my

got a vision for this place and I
 

415
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,120
got a vision for this place and I
actually pulled that guy in here that I

416
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,130
actually pulled that guy in here that I
 

417
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,980
actually pulled that guy in here that I
talked about last time

418
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:48,990

a big fan of like Arduino and all this
 

435
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,530
a big fan of like Arduino and all this
stuff and and and I just started talking

436
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:06,540
stuff and and and I just started talking
 

437
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,070
stuff and and and I just started talking
about my my thoughts about 3d printers

438
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,080
about my my thoughts about 3d printers
 

439
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,750
about my my thoughts about 3d printers
and you know that's kind of a cool tack

440
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
and you know that's kind of a cool tack
 

441
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,110
and you know that's kind of a cool tack
and he actually as a contractor he built

442
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
and he actually as a contractor he built
 

443
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,040
and he actually as a contractor he built
his own 3d printer like I don't mean I

444
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,050
his own 3d printer like I don't mean I
 

445
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,829
his own 3d printer like I don't mean I
don't mean he bought an SM assembly kit

446
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
don't mean he bought an SM assembly kit
 

447
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
don't mean he bought an SM assembly kit
with all the parts like he designed and

448
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,050
with all the parts like he designed and
 

449
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,420
with all the parts like he designed and
built his own 3d printed everything that

450
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,430
built his own 3d printed everything that
 

451
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,350
built his own 3d printed everything that
would mean very tight tolerances on the

452
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:32,360
would mean very tight tolerances on the
 

453
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,710
would mean very tight tolerances on the
on the part basically you know you don't

454
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
on the part basically you know you don't
 

455
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,030
on the part basically you know you don't
have a lot of room to mess around with

456
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,040
have a lot of room to mess around with
 

457
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,120
have a lot of room to mess around with
that it's got to be pretty precise yeah

458
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,130

 

459
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,980

that's what it seems like so is Zoe and

460
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:45,990
that's what it seems like so is Zoe and
 

461
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,019
that's what it seems like so is Zoe and
he starts talking about yeah well to

462
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:48,029
he starts talking about yeah well to
 

463
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:51,170
he starts talking about yeah well to
cover this the skylight we can put in

464
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,180
cover this the skylight we can put in
 

465
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,139
cover this the skylight we can put in
like a blind system where the blinds

466
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:54,149
like a blind system where the blinds
 

467
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,110
like a blind system where the blinds
open and close and then run a track and

468
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
open and close and then run a track and
 

469
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,240
open and close and then run a track and
plug that into an Arduino and then I'll

470
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,250
plug that into an Arduino and then I'll
 

471
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,620
plug that into an Arduino and then I'll
program it so that you just push a

472
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:00,630
program it so that you just push a
 

473
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,069
program it so that you just push a
button and it'll open or close and I

474
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:03,079
button and it'll open or close and I
 

475
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,310
button and it'll open or close and I

like this guy just kind of seemed like
that's a good match because like this is

478
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,270
that's a good match because like this is
 

479
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,280
that's a good match because like this is
gonna make some really interesting

480

behind the scenes if he starts doing
 

483
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,639
behind the scenes if he starts doing
that kind of thing it's just why the

484
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:16,649
that kind of thing it's just why the
 

485
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:19,910
that kind of thing it's just why the
fans running in your next to you is the

486
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
fans running in your next to you is the
 

487
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,470
fans running in your next to you is the
air conditioner not up to keeping the

488
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
air conditioner not up to keeping the
 

489
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,990
air conditioner not up to keeping the
space cool when the really it wasn't but

490
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,000
space cool when the really it wasn't but
 

491
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,870
space cool when the really it wasn't but
that brings a point point B oh when I

492
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:29,880
that brings a point point B oh when I
 

493
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,860
that brings a point point B oh when I
came in to get the server back up and

494
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:33,870
came in to get the server back up and
 

495
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,800
came in to get the server back up and
running the AC was actually running for

496
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:36,810

where I brought in the fan I'm confused
 

505
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,510
where I brought in the fan I'm confused
because when you moved into the space

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:53,630
any stretch but I posted on Twitter this
 

821
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,900
any stretch but I posted on Twitter this
this week because or maybe just

822
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:55,910
this week because or maybe just
 

823
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,030
this week because or maybe just
yesterday because I had a chat on the

824
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,040
yesterday because I had a chat on the
 

825
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
yesterday because I had a chat on the
names discord server with one of my

826
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,050
names discord server with one of my
 

827
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,020
names discord server with one of my
users about creating a box that would

828
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,030
users about creating a box that would
 

829
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,360
users about creating a box that would
connect to an M server over GPIO to a

830
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,370
connect to an M server over GPIO to a
 

831
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,200
connect to an M server over GPIO to a
Raspberry Pi and then based on the

832
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,210
Raspberry Pi and then based on the
 

833
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,970
Raspberry Pi and then based on the
response of the Tempur device which is

834
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:12,980
response of the Tempur device which is
 

835
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,680
response of the Tempur device which is
the temperature sensor the USB

836
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:14,690
the temperature sensor the USB
 

837
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,980
the temperature sensor the USB
temperature sensor if it got too hot it

838
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:17,990
temperature sensor if it got too hot it
 

839
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,940
temperature sensor if it got too hot it
would turn on 110 volt power outlet and

840
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:21,950
would turn on 110 volt power outlet and
 

841
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,220
would turn on 110 volt power outlet and
he'd have two fans plugged into that

842
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,230
he'd have two fans plugged into that
 

843
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,520
he'd have two fans plugged into that
outlet and so if the room got too hot

844
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,530
outlet and so if the room got too hot
 

845
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,500
outlet and so if the room got too hot
the fans would automatically turn on and

846
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:29,510
the fans would automatically turn on and
 

847
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,840
the fans would automatically turn on and
then if it came down to temperature it

848
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:31,850
then if it came down to temperature it
 

849
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,760
then if it came down to temperature it
would turn off the fans automatically so

850
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:33,770
would turn off the fans automatically so
 

851
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,860
would turn off the fans automatically so
like I love tinkering with that kind of

852
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:35,870
like I love tinkering with that kind of
 

853
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:49,880
like I love tinkering with that kind of
stuff yeah yeah

854
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:49,890

 

855
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,410

yeah you can easily enough make your own

856
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:52,420
yeah you can easily enough make your own
 

857
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,930
yeah you can easily enough make your own
temperature sensor I just have because

858
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:54,940
temperature sensor I just have because
 

859
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,090
temperature sensor I just have because
I've got the USB temper device it's just

860
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,100
I've got the USB temper device it's just
 

861
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:09,780
I've got the USB temper device it's just
so easy you just plug it yeah yeah yeah

862
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:09,790
so easy you just plug it yeah yeah yeah
 

863
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:37,110
so easy you just plug it yeah yeah yeah
they're so like oriented I love that in

864
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
they're so like oriented I love that in
 

865
00:24:37,120 --> 00:25:22,320
they're so like oriented I love that in
the floor so he had that's ok so he runs

866
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,330
the floor so he had that's ok so he runs
 

867
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,990
the floor so he had that's ok so he runs
up the CPU he oh there are more

868
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,000
up the CPU he oh there are more
 

869
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:37,260
up the CPU he oh there are more
efficient ways to do this yeah yeah I've

870
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,270
efficient ways to do this yeah yeah I've
 

871
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,120
efficient ways to do this yeah yeah I've
got some I've got all that like the

872
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,130
got some I've got all that like the
 

873
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,680
got some I've got all that like the
thermistors and everything yeah I can

874
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:40,690
thermistors and everything yeah I can
 

875
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,000
thermistors and everything yeah I can
build those things and but I'm I I still

876
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,010
build those things and but I'm I I still
 

877
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,100
build those things and but I'm I I still
like the temper I still like the

878
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,110
like the temper I still like the
 

879
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,799
like the temper I still like the
convenience

880
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:52,809

 

881
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:55,630

Peter I gotta give vp9 a chance to talk

882
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:55,640
Peter I gotta give vp9 a chance to talk
 

883
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,420
Peter I gotta give vp9 a chance to talk
because we're running short on time here

884
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,430
because we're running short on time here
 

885
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,670
because we're running short on time here
what do you been up to do well two

886
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:00,680
what do you been up to do well two
 

887
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:07,030
what do you been up to do well two
things the first is I've taken baby baby

888
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,040
things the first is I've taken baby baby
 

889
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,110
things the first is I've taken baby baby
baby steps with my own time and bricked

890
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
baby steps with my own time and bricked
 

891
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:19,330
baby steps with my own time and bricked
it yeah yeah well I say bricked it but

892
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:19,340
it yeah yeah well I say bricked it but
 

893
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,419
it yeah yeah well I say bricked it but
I've taken what you have to do is you

894
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:22,429
I've taken what you have to do is you
 

895
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:26,860
I've taken what you have to do is you
have to unlock a programming bit so that

896
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:26,870
have to unlock a programming bit so that
 

897
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,700
have to unlock a programming bit so that
you can reprogram the pine type because

898
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:30,710
you can reprogram the pine type because
 

899
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,160
you can reprogram the pine type because
as it comes it comes locked with a

900
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,170
as it comes it comes locked with a
 

901
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,090
as it comes it comes locked with a
software bit that prevents you from from

902
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,100
software bit that prevents you from from
 

903
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,970
software bit that prevents you from from
programming it so I did that I followed

904
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:39,980
programming it so I did that I followed
 

905
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,130
programming it so I did that I followed
that process doesn't make a whole lot of

906
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,140
that process doesn't make a whole lot of
 

907
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,299
that process doesn't make a whole lot of
sense for a developer camp it's just the

908
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:46,309
sense for a developer camp it's just the
 

909
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,570
sense for a developer camp it's just the
way it came delivered so I loved it then

910
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:49,580
way it came delivered so I loved it then
 

911
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,340
way it came delivered so I loved it then
I tried to program it but it refused to

912
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,350
I tried to program it but it refused to
 

913
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,240
I tried to program it but it refused to
program the process of unlocking it

914
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,250
program the process of unlocking it
 

915
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:59,169
program the process of unlocking it
causes it to means that whatever was in

916
00:26:59,169 --> 00:26:59,179
causes it to means that whatever was in
 

917
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:00,970
causes it to means that whatever was in
the memory gets a race that's part of a

918
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:00,980
the memory gets a race that's part of a
 

919
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,000
the memory gets a race that's part of a
process so now there's literally

920
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,010
process so now there's literally
 

921
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,950
process so now there's literally
literally nothing in the memory of it

922
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:05,960
literally nothing in the memory of it
 

923
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,520
literally nothing in the memory of it
anymore

924
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:06,530
anymore
 

925
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,680
anymore
it's waiting patiently for me to figure

926
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:08,690
it's waiting patiently for me to figure
 

927
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,760
it's waiting patiently for me to figure
out how to program it but have any idea

928
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:14,770

 

929
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:19,510

who episode did that discover the robot

930
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
who episode did that discover the robot
 

931
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,190
who episode did that discover the robot
floating in space it came out aboard and

932
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,200
floating in space it came out aboard and
 

933
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,110
floating in space it came out aboard and
the Bellomo was kidnapped and then in

934
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
the Bellomo was kidnapped and then in
 

935
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,370
the Bellomo was kidnapped and then in
order to build a new one

936
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:30,380
order to build a new one
 

937
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:42,190
order to build a new one
