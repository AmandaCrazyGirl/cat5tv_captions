other day Netflix recommended it to us I
 

647
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,830
other day Netflix recommended it to us I
don't know if it's brand new or what but

648
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
don't know if it's brand new or what but
 

649

all of their electricity is generated by

652
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:08,950
all of their electricity is generated by
 

653
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,440
all of their electricity is generated by
natural processes and it's just amazing

654
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,450
natural processes and it's just amazing
 

655
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,250
natural processes and it's just amazing
they have so outside of their generator

656
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:20,260
they have so outside of their generator
 

657
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,770

it into with turbines turning it into
 

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
it into with turbines turning it into
electricity and then taking the the

664
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,250
electricity and then taking the the
 

665
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,090
electricity and then taking the the
gases and pumping them back into the

666
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,100
gases and pumping them back into the
 

667

there's absolutely no waste there's

670
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,330
there's absolutely no waste there's
 

671
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,180
there's absolutely no waste there's
nothing and and they've got electric

672
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,190
nothing and and they've got electric
 

673
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,140

recharged by this steam station yes away

676
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,140
recharged by this steam station yes away
 

677
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,600
recharged by this steam station yes away
in a wild and I'm like man like if our

678
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:51,610
in a wild and I'm like man like if our
 

679
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,850
in a wild and I'm like man like if our
infrastructure wasn't so fossil fuel

680
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:53,860
infrastructure wasn't so fossil fuel
 

681
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,340
infrastructure wasn't so fossil fuel
days and maybe that's it like they had

682
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,350
days and maybe that's it like they had
 

683
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,290
days and maybe that's it like they had
to come up with solutions that worked

684
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,300
to come up with solutions that worked
 

685
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,650
to come up with solutions that worked
for them in in like in Iceland but man

686
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:01,660
for them in in like in Iceland but man
 

687
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,590
for them in in like in Iceland but man
that's just mind-bending Iceland has one

688
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:04,600
that's just mind-bending Iceland has one
 

689
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,780
that's just mind-bending Iceland has one
of the highest volcanic activity in the

690
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:06,790
of the highest volcanic activity in the
 

691
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,900
of the highest volcanic activity in the
world and their to it they're turning it

692
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:09,910
world and their to it they're turning it
 

693
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,720
world and their to it they're turning it
into it's really interesting

694
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:14,730
into it's really interesting
 

695
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,400
into it's really interesting
all right yeah here's they harnessed the

696
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,410
all right yeah here's they harnessed the
 

697
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,440
all right yeah here's they harnessed the
wind I feel like there would never be a

698
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,450
wind I feel like there would never be a
 

699
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:53,010
wind I feel like there would never be a
shortage of oh my gosh anyway so on that

700
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:53,020
shortage of oh my gosh anyway so on that
 

701
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,600
shortage of oh my gosh anyway so on that
note I think it's great that they're

702
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:54,610
note I think it's great that they're
 

703
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,070
note I think it's great that they're
putting in charging stations because

704
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,080
putting in charging stations because
 

705
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,920
putting in charging stations because
that's gonna but it depends on because

706
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:58,930
that's gonna but it depends on because
 

707
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,950
that's gonna but it depends on because
we have the problem here in in our area

708
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:01,960
we have the problem here in in our area
 

709
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,320
we have the problem here in in our area
that they can put in charging stations

710
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,330
that they can put in charging stations
 

711
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,070
that they can put in charging stations
and you think that you're doing

712
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,080
and you think that you're doing
 

713
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,700
and you think that you're doing
something good for the environment

714
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:05,710
something good for the environment
 

715
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,560
something good for the environment
because you're using an electric car but

716
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:07,570
because you're using an electric car but
 

717
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,290
because you're using an electric car but
where's the electricity coming from

718
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,300
where's the electricity coming from
 

719
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,780
where's the electricity coming from
fossil fuels well erm it is

720
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:12,790
fossil fuels well erm it is
 

721
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,820
fossil fuels well erm it is
that is the individual internal

722
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:17,830
that is the individual internal
 

723
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,380
that is the individual internal
combustion engines generate more

724
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,390
combustion engines generate more
 

725
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,380
combustion engines generate more
pollution than the central electricity

726
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,390
pollution than the central electricity
 

727
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,780
pollution than the central electricity
oh you know I absolutely understand that

728
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:24,790
oh you know I absolutely understand that
 

729
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,690
oh you know I absolutely understand that
is laying down that yeah I am sure of

730
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:27,700
is laying down that yeah I am sure of
 

731
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,720
is laying down that yeah I am sure of
that but what I saw in that documentary

732
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:30,730
that but what I saw in that documentary
 

733
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,300
that but what I saw in that documentary
took it like way to the next level and

734
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,310
took it like way to the next level and
 

735
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,940
took it like way to the next level and
showed that so much more could be done

736
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:35,950
showed that so much more could be done
 

737
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,160
showed that so much more could be done
that through it's really intriguing

738
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,170
that through it's really intriguing
 

739
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,270
that through it's really intriguing
don't sure about that yeah but a

740
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,280
don't sure about that yeah but a
 

741
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,070
don't sure about that yeah but a
question one last question for Sascha

765
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,850

project for you to do would be to go to

766
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:44,860
project for you to do would be to go to
 

767
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,530
project for you to do would be to go to
google and type type in speed test so

768
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:49,540
google and type type in speed test so
 

769
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,960
google and type type in speed test so
you're on a call but do that for the

770
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:51,970
you're on a call but do that for the
 

771
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,490
you're on a call but do that for the
next time that you see us and tell us

772
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:53,500
next time that you see us and tell us
 

773
00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:09,720
next time that you see us and tell us
what your results are if you just type

774
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:09,730
what your results are if you just type
 

775
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,850
what your results are if you just type
speed test in Google they actually have

776
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:11,860
speed test in Google they actually have
 

777
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
speed test in Google they actually have
one built into the search engine you run

778
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:13,870
one built into the search engine you run
 

779
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,020
one built into the search engine you run
speed test and it seems to be pretty

780
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,030
speed test and it seems to be pretty
 

781
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:23,220
speed test and it seems to be pretty
accurate okay do it twice no no once

782
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,230
