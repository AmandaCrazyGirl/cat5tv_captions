like a punch in here but i'm not careful

190
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
like a punch in here but i'm not careful

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
oh yeah okay
 

193
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,030
oh yeah okay
so we've got i think play rain metroid

194
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
so we've got i think play rain metroid
 

195
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,590
so we've got i think play rain metroid
uh uh playing very little for that's the

196
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
uh uh playing very little for that's the
 

197
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,310
uh uh playing very little for that's the
second hand

198
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
second hand
 

199
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,510
second hand
oh yeah hey that works yeah it's it's

200
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
oh yeah hey that works yeah it's it's
 

201
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,430
oh yeah hey that works yeah it's it's
harder to drill into the concrete block

202
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
harder to drill into the concrete block
 

203
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,870
harder to drill into the concrete block
so you may as well put that up and then

204
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
so you may as well put that up and then
 

205
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,310
so you may as well put that up and then
you've got something you can screw into

206
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
you've got something you can screw into
 

207
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,870
you've got something you can screw into
eh

208
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
eh
 

209
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,230
eh
we we actually uh uh have actually

210
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
we we actually uh uh have actually
 

211
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,590
we we actually uh uh have actually
screwed into the

212
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
screwed into the
 

213
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,950
screwed into the
what we got is uh um

214
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
what we got is uh um
 

215
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,150
what we got is uh um
blocks and then uh and then we

216
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
blocks and then uh and then we
 

217
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,070
blocks and then uh and then we
put the balls on top then we screwed in

218
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
put the balls on top then we screwed in
 

219
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,270
put the balls on top then we screwed in
with um

220
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
with um
 

221
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,629
with um
wall plugs and and then yeah

222
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
wall plugs and and then yeah
 

223
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,629
wall plugs and and then yeah
i guess that that can make it more solid

224
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
i guess that that can make it more solid
 

225
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,670
i guess that that can make it more solid
too like i know when

226
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
too like i know when
 

227
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,110
too like i know when
uh when the contractor was putting

228
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
uh when the contractor was putting
 

229
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,430
uh when the contractor was putting
everything up here he had

230
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
everything up here he had
 

231
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,749
everything up here he had
like quarter inch thick boards that he's

232
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
like quarter inch thick boards that he's
 

233
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,790
like quarter inch thick boards that he's
mounted on the wall

234
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
mounted on the wall
 

235
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,110
mounted on the wall
first and then he's mounted our things

236
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
first and then he's mounted our things
 

237
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,629
first and then he's mounted our things
onto that so that it's not putting too

238
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
onto that so that it's not putting too
 

239
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,150
onto that so that it's not putting too
much of a load on this

240
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
much of a load on this
 

241
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,350
much of a load on this
the single stud it's kind of spread out

242
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
the single stud it's kind of spread out
 

243
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,629
the single stud it's kind of spread out
yeah these things you'd think and they

well

518
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
well
 

519
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,150
well
um last week when when i talked it was

520
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
um last week when when i talked it was
 

521
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,990
um last week when when i talked it was
you know i was trying to find ways

522
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
you know i was trying to find ways
 

523
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,990
you know i was trying to find ways
i'm building another application that

524
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
i'm building another application that
 

525
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,910
i'm building another application that
works in a similar way

526
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
works in a similar way
 

527
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,750
works in a similar way
and i was trying to figure out what is

528
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
and i was trying to figure out what is
 

529
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,550
and i was trying to figure out what is
the best way to keep the data in sync

530
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
the best way to keep the data in sync
 

531
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,670
the best way to keep the data in sync
because i don't want to have separate

532
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
because i don't want to have separate
 

533
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,829
because i don't want to have separate
sets of data on each device i don't want

534
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
sets of data on each device i don't want
 

535
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,949
sets of data on each device i don't want
the laptop to have

536
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
the laptop to have
 

537
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,630
the laptop to have
one set of data the android phone to

538
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
one set of data the android phone to
 

539
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,990
one set of data the android phone to
have another set of data

540
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
have another set of data
 

541
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,509
have another set of data
the main machine to have another set of

542
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
the main machine to have another set of
 

543
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,990
the main machine to have another set of
data that won't work i really

544
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
data that won't work i really
 

545
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,550
data that won't work i really
need them to sync up and last week i

546
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
need them to sync up and last week i
 

547
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,670
need them to sync up and last week i
talked about well

548
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
talked about well
 

549
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,790
talked about well
one of my options is to have

550
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
one of my options is to have
 

551
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,230
one of my options is to have
the device or have an always

552
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
the device or have an always
 

553
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,230
the device or have an always
on connection to the server all the time

554
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
on connection to the server all the time
 

555
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,030
on connection to the server all the time
well great a great idea but not so smart

556
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
well great a great idea but not so smart
 

557
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,949
well great a great idea but not so smart
especially if you're not at the house or

558
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
especially if you're not at the house or
 

559
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,630
especially if you're not at the house or
or not in range of the network or

560
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
or not in range of the network or
 

561
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,389
or not in range of the network or
whatever the case may be

562
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
whatever the case may be
 

563
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,389
whatever the case may be
so i'm working right now on um

564
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
so i'm working right now on um
 

565
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,269
so i'm working right now on um
on that on implementing the same

566
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
on that on implementing the same
 

567
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,389
on that on implementing the same
protocol that task warrior does

568
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
protocol that task warrior does
 

569
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,389
protocol that task warrior does
and that's a batch that's that's a batch

570
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
and that's a batch that's that's a batch
 

571
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,230
and that's a batch that's that's a batch
process the idea is that

572
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
process the idea is that
 

573
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,670
process the idea is that
you collect all your data in a local

574
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
you collect all your data in a local
 

575
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,550
you collect all your data in a local
file on your local device then whenever

576
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
file on your local device then whenever
 

577
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,629
file on your local device then whenever
you get ready to sync you send that data

578
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
you get ready to sync you send that data
 

579
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,910
you get ready to sync you send that data
to the server

580
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
to the server
 

581
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,750
to the server
then it plays it back along with all the

582
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
then it plays it back along with all the
 

583
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,310
then it plays it back along with all the
other updates that everybody else gave

584
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
other updates that everybody else gave
 

585
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,310
other updates that everybody else gave
and then you build your database with

586
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
and then you build your database with
 

587
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,670
and then you build your database with
that uh

588
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
that uh
 

589
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,990
that uh
you end up having a set of server

590
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
you end up having a set of server
 

591
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,190
you end up having a set of server
requests

592
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
requests
 

593
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,829
requests
you store and that's how you build let's

594
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
you store and that's how you build let's
 

595
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,750
you store and that's how you build let's
take you keep your database in sync

596
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
take you keep your database in sync
 

597
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,590
take you keep your database in sync
so i would imagine the deduplication

598
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
so i would imagine the deduplication
 

599
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,269
so i would imagine the deduplication
occurs on the server

600
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
occurs on the server
 

601
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,030
occurs on the server
to make sure that it's not adding

602
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
to make sure that it's not adding
 

603
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,629
to make sure that it's not adding
duplicate data

604
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
duplicate data
 

605
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,790
duplicate data
and then sends out the consolidated

606
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
and then sends out the consolidated
 

607
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,670
and then sends out the consolidated
information

608
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
information
 

609
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,949
information
yeah yeah that's if you do an ad of an

610
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
yeah yeah that's if you do an ad of an
 

611
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,550
yeah yeah that's if you do an ad of an
item that is already there

612
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
item that is already there
 

613
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,629
item that is already there
um yeah the impact really is do you want

614
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
um yeah the impact really is do you want
 

615
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,030
um yeah the impact really is do you want
to just add it or replace it and

616
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
to just add it or replace it and
 

617
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,190
to just add it or replace it and
as a designer i could say well i could

618
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
as a designer i could say well i could
 

619
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,550
as a designer i could say well i could
just replace it

620
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
just replace it
 

621
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,150
just replace it
with the with the old palm pilot um

622
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
with the with the old palm pilot um
 

623
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,150
with the with the old palm pilot um
applications what would happen is you

624
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
applications what would happen is you
 

625
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,509
applications what would happen is you
would get two items

626
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
would get two items
 

627
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,670
would get two items
in your database yes the hot sync

628
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
in your database yes the hot sync
 

629
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,550
in your database yes the hot sync
protocol

630
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
protocol
 

631
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,310
protocol
you actually ended up with two duplicate

632
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
you actually ended up with two duplicate
 

633
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,910
you actually ended up with two duplicate
items that you'd have to delete one of

634
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
items that you'd have to delete one of
 

635
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,710
items that you'd have to delete one of
them

636
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
them
 

637
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,069
them
so that would be another way to go so

638
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
so that would be another way to go so
 

639
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,629
so that would be another way to go so
also if you go to delete an item that's

640
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
also if you go to delete an item that's
 

641
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,990
also if you go to delete an item that's
already gone

642
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
already gone
 

643
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,590
already gone
how do you treat that do you treat that

644
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
how do you treat that do you treat that
 

645
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,030
how do you treat that do you treat that
as an error or do you

646
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
as an error or do you
 

647
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,629
as an error or do you
uh or do you just uh uh treat it like oh

648
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
uh or do you just uh uh treat it like oh
 

649
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,910
uh or do you just uh uh treat it like oh
well it's already gone i don't have to

650
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
well it's already gone i don't have to
 

651
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,430
well it's already gone i don't have to
worry about it just acknowledge it and

652
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
worry about it just acknowledge it and
 

653
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,710
worry about it just acknowledge it and
be like all right done

654
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
be like all right done
 

655
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,389
be like all right done
yeah yeah these are these are the

656
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
yeah yeah these are these are the
 

657
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,069
yeah yeah these are these are the
questions that i'm

658
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
questions that i'm
 

659
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,509
questions that i'm
designing through right now that's

660
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
designing through right now that's
 

661
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,110
designing through right now that's
awesome very quick

662

00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
and maybe make it configurable or
 

669
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,590
and maybe make it configurable or

679
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,509
noticed that i knew i heard the uh about
this before um is a free software

680
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
this before um is a free software
 

681
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,350
this before um is a free software
project and it's in all the major

is a what software project task warrior

686
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
is a what software project task warrior
 

687
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,470
is a what software project task warrior
yeah i know but but what was it you said

688
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
yeah i know but but what was it you said

selbu about
 

691
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:11,750
selbu about
uh task warrior you said

692
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760

 

693
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,269

that's one of the reasons i like it you

694
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
that's one of the reasons i like it you
 

695
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,790
that's one of the reasons i like it you
don't have to have x running or anything

696
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
don't have to have x running or anything
 

697
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,389
don't have to have x running or anything
to make it work it's just

698
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
to make it work it's just
 

699
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,470
to make it work it's just
it's all it's all command line based

700
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
it's all it's all command line based
 

701
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,910
it's all it's all command line based
yeah and that means

702
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
yeah and that means
 

703
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,990
yeah and that means
that that makes it makes it so that if

704
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
that that makes it makes it so that if
 

705
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,670
that that makes it makes it so that if
you're out and about and

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
you're out and about and
 

707
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,150
you're out and about and
you don't have it on a system that you

708
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
you don't have it on a system that you
 

709
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,590
you don't have it on a system that you
yourself

710
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
yourself
 

711
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,350
yourself
the video you can

712
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360

 

713
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,509

you can always build a ui on top of it

714
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
you can always build a ui on top of it
 

715
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,389
you can always build a ui on top of it
if you want to

716
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
if you want to
 

717
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,069
if you want to
but you don't have to right it's always

718
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
but you don't have to right it's always
 

719
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,069
but you don't have to right it's always
nice to have that common denominator

720
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
nice to have that common denominator
 

721
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,350
nice to have that common denominator
that command line at the

722
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
that command line at the
 

723
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,110

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
this is
 

765
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,629
this is
obviously still a mess right here

766
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
obviously still a mess right here
 

767
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,069
obviously still a mess right here
because i haven't done the cabling or

768
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
because i haven't done the cabling or
 

769
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:28,949
because i haven't done the cabling or
anything but

770
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
anything but
 

771
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,590
anything but
um they've got the tv up on the wall

772
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
um they've got the tv up on the wall
 

773
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,470
um they've got the tv up on the wall
we've got the

774
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
we've got the
 

775
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,949
we've got the
rack uh the the rail system for the

776
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
rack uh the the rail system for the
 

777
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,590
rack uh the the rail system for the
drapes

778
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
drapes
 

779
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,550
drapes
that's what it looks like so there's a

780
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
that's what it looks like so there's a
 

781
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,069
that's what it looks like so there's a
like a pulley over here

782
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
like a pulley over here
 

783
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,310
like a pulley over here
to bring the drapes down or put them up

784
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
to bring the drapes down or put them up
 

785
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,829
to bring the drapes down or put them up
um and there's room

786
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
um and there's room
 

787
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,069
um and there's room
i'm going to put a black drape and

788
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
i'm going to put a black drape and
 

789
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,430
i'm going to put a black drape and
possibly a white one

790
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
possibly a white one
 

791
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,870
possibly a white one
so then we can just change the

792
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
so then we can just change the
 

793
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,470
so then we can just change the
background we're going to use a i

794
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
background we're going to use a i
 

795
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,590
background we're going to use a i

yeah those uh and the pulleys reminds me
 

833
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,230
yeah those uh and the pulleys reminds me
of a video i saw yesterday

834

835
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,389

give me a high five for the screen

836
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399

office and
 

869
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,829
office and
sitting down on the chair and

870
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
sitting down on the chair and
 

871
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,270
sitting down on the chair and
immediately as he

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
immediately as he
 

873
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,990
immediately as he
sat down and in the back the uh

sat down and in the back the uh
 

875
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,710
sat down and in the back the uh
elected there was elected curtains on

876
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
elected there was elected curtains on
 

877
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,750
elected there was elected curtains on
the window

878
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
the window
 

879
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,150
the window
and they closed just as he sat down and

880
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
and they closed just as he sat down and
 

881
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,990
and they closed just as he sat down and
the the switch for those turns

882
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
the the switch for those turns
 

883
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,150
the the switch for those turns
it was right behind the uh armrest

884
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
it was right behind the uh armrest
 

885
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,430
it was right behind the uh armrest
and so he bumped it by accident yeah

886
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440

 

887
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:52,070

and they lost them because

888
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080

 

889
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,750

i figure you could use like a motion

890
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
i figure you could use like a motion
 

891
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,270
i figure you could use like a motion
sensor like a pir

892
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
sensor like a pir
 

893
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,029
sensor like a pir
or something and as soon as you trip it

894
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
or something and as soon as you trip it
 

895
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,310
or something and as soon as you trip it
it like closes the blinds for you

896
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
it like closes the blinds for you
 

897
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,350
it like closes the blinds for you
that would be neat i i have a pir that i

898
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
that would be neat i i have a pir that i
 

899
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,710
that would be neat i i have a pir that i
was thinking about

900
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
was thinking about
 

901
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,750
was thinking about
connecting to an arduino uh maybe like a

902
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
connecting to an arduino uh maybe like a
 

903
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,950
connecting to an arduino uh maybe like a
digispark

904
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
digispark
 

905
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,549
digispark
and with the pir send a keystroke

906
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
and with the pir send a keystroke
 

907
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,990
and with the pir send a keystroke
to usb which would be like a keyboard

908
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
to usb which would be like a keyboard
 

909
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,909
to usb which would be like a keyboard
keystroke which would trigger a camera

910
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
keystroke which would trigger a camera
 

911
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,870
keystroke which would trigger a camera
shot

912
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
shot
 

913
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,150
shot
do you guys remember me talking about

914
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
do you guys remember me talking about
 

915
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,070
do you guys remember me talking about
this at any point so

916
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
this at any point so
 

917
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,630
this at any point so
if i put a camera say in the producer's

918
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
if i put a camera say in the producer's
 

919
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,350
if i put a camera say in the producer's
room

920
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
room
 

921
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,669
room
i could set up a pir sensor that as soon

922
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
i could set up a pir sensor that as soon
 

923
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,190
i could set up a pir sensor that as soon
as i walk in that room

924
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
as i walk in that room
 

925
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,990
as i walk in that room
it would turn on that camera so that if

926
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
it would turn on that camera so that if
 

927
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,669
it would turn on that camera so that if
if i was doing a presentation

928
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
if i was doing a presentation
 

929
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,270
if i was doing a presentation
and i didn't have somebody to do camera

930
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
and i didn't have somebody to do camera
 

931
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,710
and i didn't have somebody to do camera
switching for me it would automatically

932
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
switching for me it would automatically
 

933
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,470
switching for me it would automatically
switch based on the pir

934
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480

 

935
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,190

i have done something similar with uh

936
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
i have done something similar with uh
 

937
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,630
i have done something similar with uh
with cameras but they

938
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
with cameras but they
 

939
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,669
with cameras but they
use motion detection not sure what par

940
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
use motion detection not sure what par
 

941
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,990
use motion detection not sure what par
is is that uh infrared passive infrared

942
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
is is that uh infrared passive infrared
 

943
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,789
is is that uh infrared passive infrared
yeah like

944
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
yeah like
 

945
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,190
yeah like
like motion sensor yeah what i've done

946
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
like motion sensor yeah what i've done
 

947
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,029
like motion sensor yeah what i've done
with any regular webcam in a

948
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
with any regular webcam in a
 

949
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,310
with any regular webcam in a
fairly basic project uh package on

950
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
fairly basic project uh package on
 

951
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,510
fairly basic project uh package on
ubuntu is it will it will

952
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
ubuntu is it will it will
 

953
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,070
ubuntu is it will it will
sense any kind of change in pixels on

954
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
sense any kind of change in pixels on
 

955
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,190
sense any kind of change in pixels on
the camera

956
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
the camera
 

957
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,190
the camera
and only then will it fire up a shot so

958
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
and only then will it fire up a shot so
 

959
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,470
and only then will it fire up a shot so
it's not a time lapse

960
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
it's not a time lapse
 

961
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,470
it's not a time lapse
it doesn't do it every time yeah you

962
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
it doesn't do it every time yeah you
 

963
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,230
it doesn't do it every time yeah you
know at a regular time but what it will

964
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
know at a regular time but what it will
 

965
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,950
know at a regular time but what it will
do is

966
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
do is
 

967
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,310
do is
whenever um any motions detected

968
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
whenever um any motions detected
 

969
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,510
whenever um any motions detected
based on pixels changing on the uh

970
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
based on pixels changing on the uh
 

971
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,870
based on pixels changing on the uh
on the um on the camera then it it

972
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
on the um on the camera then it it
 

973
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,070
on the um on the camera then it it
preserves your shot so the difference

974
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
preserves your shot so the difference
 

975
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,630
preserves your shot so the difference
the difference with pixel versus pir is

976
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
the difference with pixel versus pir is
 

977
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,950
the difference with pixel versus pir is
pir is actually sensing the heat

978
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
pir is actually sensing the heat
 

979
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,350
pir is actually sensing the heat
so if a human walks in the room it will

980
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
so if a human walks in the room it will
 

981
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,390
so if a human walks in the room it will
set it off

982
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
set it off
 

983
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,270
set it off
but not an insect or a shift in the

984
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
but not an insect or a shift in the
 

985
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,150
but not an insect or a shift in the
lighting

986
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160

987
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,150
lighting
those kinds of things smoking what about

988
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
those kinds of things smoking what about
 

989
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,990
those kinds of things smoking what about
if we were smoking

990
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
if we were smoking
 

991
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,430
if we were smoking
well if someone was smoking in our

992
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
well if someone was smoking in our
 

993
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,010
well if someone was smoking in our
studio i'd tell them to get out

994
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,020
studio i'd tell them to get out
 

995
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,150
studio i'd tell them to get out
[Laughter]

996
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160

 

997
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,549

the cigarette sure would yeah the smoke

998
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
the cigarette sure would yeah the smoke
 

999
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,310
the cigarette sure would yeah the smoke
probably would as well because

1000
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
probably would as well because
 

1001
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,990
probably would as well because
uh the the the heat uh the moisture

1002
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
uh the the the heat uh the moisture
 

1003
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,990
uh the the the heat uh the moisture
droplets which we've all learned about

1004
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
droplets which we've all learned about
 

1005
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,830
droplets which we've all learned about
we've got our masks right

1006
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840

 

1007
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,510

yeah if you ever wonder if mass make a

1008
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
yeah if you ever wonder if mass make a
 

1009
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,870
yeah if you ever wonder if mass make a
difference just watch people at a

1010
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
difference just watch people at a
 

1011
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,750
difference just watch people at a
smoking section

1012
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760

 

1013
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,070

tested motion cameras as a security

1014
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
tested motion cameras as a security

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,070
tested motion cameras as a security
feature

1016
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
feature
 

1017
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,510
feature
about if you can fool them in some way

1018
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
about if you can fool them in some way
 

1019
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,430
about if you can fool them in some way
um and they test that fulfilling their

room completely with smoke
 

1023
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,310
room completely with smoke
it had no effect yeah but um holding up

1024
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
it had no effect yeah but um holding up
 

1025
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,750
it had no effect yeah but um holding up
a curtain and then walking

1026
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
a curtain and then walking
 

1027
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,430
a curtain and then walking
slowly past the camera that worked

1028
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
slowly past the camera that worked
 

1029
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,350
slowly past the camera that worked
because it sealed that right

1030
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
because it sealed that right
 

1031
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,430
because it sealed that right
the heat couldn't get so that that drape

1032
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
the heat couldn't get so that that drape
 

1033
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,190
the heat couldn't get so that that drape
would have to be thick enough

1034
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
would have to be thick enough
 

1035
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,630
would have to be thick enough
that it would it would block the heat

1036
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
that it would it would block the heat
 

1037
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,750
that it would it would block the heat
because infrared is detected

1038
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
because infrared is detected
 

1039
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,909
because infrared is detected
really all it would have to do is stop

1040
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
really all it would have to do is stop
 

1041
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,390
really all it would have to do is stop
movement of air robbie because uh

1042
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
movement of air robbie because uh
 

1043
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,830
movement of air robbie because uh
because this isn't that well infrared

1044
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
because this isn't that well infrared
 

1045
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,510
because this isn't that well infrared
but you are still generating a certain

1046
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
but you are still generating a certain
 

1047
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,669
but you are still generating a certain
amount of heat so that sheet if it was

1048
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
amount of heat so that sheet if it was
 

1049
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,870
amount of heat so that sheet if it was
cold would work

1050
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880
cold would work
 

1051
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,390
cold would work
but i would think if it was too thin it

1052
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
but i would think if it was too thin it
 

1053
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,149
but i would think if it was too thin it
would still allow some of that heat to

1054
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
would still allow some of that heat to
 

1055
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,789
would still allow some of that heat to
be visible to an infrared sensor

1056
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
be visible to an infrared sensor
 

1057
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,950
be visible to an infrared sensor
i would expect i don't know because it's

1058
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
i would expect i don't know because it's
 

1059
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,070
i would expect i don't know because it's
not it's not

1060
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
not it's not
 

1061
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,270
not it's not
visibility it's heat yeah yeah

1062
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
visibility it's heat yeah yeah
 

1063
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,270
visibility it's heat yeah yeah
yep and they also tested the

1064
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
yep and they also tested the
 

1065
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,029
yep and they also tested the
fingerprint sensors um in order to open

1066
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
fingerprint sensors um in order to open
 

1067
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,510
fingerprint sensors um in order to open
uh

1068
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
uh
 

1069
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,789
uh
locks in secure areas

1070
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
locks in secure areas
 

1071
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,669
locks in secure areas
um every lock they tried and all you had

1072
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
um every lock they tried and all you had
 

1073
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,470
um every lock they tried and all you had
to do was

1074
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
to do was
 

1075
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,830
to do was
getting a fingerprint or someone and

1076
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
getting a fingerprint or someone and
 

1077
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,909
getting a fingerprint or someone and
scan a fingerprint and then printing it

1078
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
scan a fingerprint and then printing it
 

1079
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,110
scan a fingerprint and then printing it
out and

1080
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
out and
 

1081
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,470
out and
holding that yeah i heard about that um

1082
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
holding that yeah i heard about that um
 

1083
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,149
holding that yeah i heard about that um
3d printers um printing to like uh

1084
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:40,159
3d printers um printing to like uh
 

1085
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,029
3d printers um printing to like uh
like a rubber filament or something like

1086
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
like a rubber filament or something like
 

1087
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:43,909
like a rubber filament or something like
a yeah

1088
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
a yeah
 

1089
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,510
a yeah
they could actually they could make

1090
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
they could actually they could make
 

1091
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,029
they could actually they could make
gloves that would work with

1092
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
gloves that would work with
 

1093
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,430
gloves that would work with
the thumb print yeah they tried that but

1094
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
the thumb print yeah they tried that but
 

1095
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,630
the thumb print yeah they tried that but
they

1096
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
they
 

1097
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,070
they
couldn't make them uh reliable the most

1098
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
couldn't make them uh reliable the most
 

1099
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,029
couldn't make them uh reliable the most
reliable

1100
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
reliable
 

1101
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,750
reliable
method was to do to print it on a piece

1102
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
method was to do to print it on a piece
 

1103
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,190
method was to do to print it on a piece
of paper

1104
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
of paper
 

1105
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,950
of paper
really so it was optical not touch

1106
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
really so it was optical not touch
 

1107
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,390
really so it was optical not touch
that's surprising that doesn't surprise

1108
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
that's surprising that doesn't surprise
 

1109
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,630
that's surprising that doesn't surprise
me at all you just push the finger out

1110
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
me at all you just push the finger out
 

1111
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,270
me at all you just push the finger out
over a glass pane then effectively take

1112
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
over a glass pane then effectively take
 

1113
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,310
over a glass pane then effectively take
a photo of it

1114
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
a photo of it
 

1115
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,950
a photo of it
but on my phone is it is it optical or

1116
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
but on my phone is it is it optical or
 

1117
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,950
but on my phone is it is it optical or
is it an actual touch sensor

1118
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
is it an actual touch sensor
 

1119
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,710
is it an actual touch sensor
like that is reading the actual

1120
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
like that is reading the actual
 

1121
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,710
like that is reading the actual
fingerprint i don't feel like it's

1122
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
fingerprint i don't feel like it's
 

1123
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,669
fingerprint i don't feel like it's
optical like it's

1124
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
optical like it's
 

1125
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,029
optical like it's
completely opaque

1126
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
completely opaque
 

1127
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,230
completely opaque
do you think it does wow

1128
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
do you think it does wow
 

1129
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,549
do you think it does wow
but you look at a laptop maybe a laptop

1130
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
but you look at a laptop maybe a laptop
 

1131
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,549
but you look at a laptop maybe a laptop
is a better example where the laptop has

1132
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
is a better example where the laptop has
 

1133
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,029
is a better example where the laptop has
a

1134
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
a
 

1135
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,430
a
finger sensor and it's just a strip of

1136
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
finger sensor and it's just a strip of
 

1137
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,310
finger sensor and it's just a strip of
metal

1138
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
metal
 

1139
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,350
metal
yeah that can't be optical is it no no

1140
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
yeah that can't be optical is it no no
 

1141
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,549
yeah that can't be optical is it no no
no not obviously so there must be

1142
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559
no not obviously so there must be
 

1143
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,390
no not obviously so there must be
various technologies to be able to read

1144
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
various technologies to be able to read
 

1145
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,470
various technologies to be able to read
the fingerprint

1146
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
the fingerprint
 

1147
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,310
the fingerprint
i i feel like it's like those touch

1148
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
i i feel like it's like those touch
 

1149
