00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,150
ago
um i also have the boiler in the room as

492
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
um i also have the boiler in the room as
 

493
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,070
um i also have the boiler in the room as
well so that makes it warm as well well

494
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
well so that makes it warm as well well
 

495
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,710
well so that makes it warm as well well
that's certainly

496
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
that's certainly
 

497
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,750
that's certainly
wow yeah for sure yeah over there

498
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
wow yeah for sure yeah over there
 

499
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,990
wow yeah for sure yeah over there
you know that direction roughly about

500
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
you know that direction roughly about
 

501
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,509
you know that direction roughly about
about 10 feet

502
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
about 10 feet
 

503
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,110
about 10 feet
that was very warm yeah yeah yeah so um

504
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
that was very warm yeah yeah yeah so um
 

505
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,350
that was very warm yeah yeah yeah so um
yeah so that's what that's and of course

506
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
yeah so that's what that's and of course
 

507
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,430
yeah so that's what that's and of course
the temperature and the humidity goes up

508
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
the temperature and the humidity goes up
 

509
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,230
the temperature and the humidity goes up
and down like crazy outside it's it's

510
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
and down like crazy outside it's it's
 

511
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,750
and down like crazy outside it's it's
nuts um and it differs quite a bit from

512
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
nuts um and it differs quite a bit from
 

513
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,630
nuts um and it differs quite a bit from
what the uh

514
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
what the uh
 

515
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,630
what the uh
the weather guesses so the temperature

516
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
the weather guesses so the temperature
 

517
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,230
the weather guesses so the temperature
in the humanity should be as well

518
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
in the humanity should be as well
 

519
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,990
in the humanity should be as well
which is always interesting now of

520
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
which is always interesting now of
 

521
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,670
which is always interesting now of
course it depends on what the accuracy

522
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
course it depends on what the accuracy
 

523
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,550
course it depends on what the accuracy
of the

524
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
of the
 

525
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,310
of the
sending devices you know the sensor

526
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
sending devices you know the sensor
 

527
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,230
sending devices you know the sensor
device but you know

528
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
device but you know
 

529
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,630
device but you know
if it's off by a degree or two it's

530
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
if it's off by a degree or two it's
 

531
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,350
if it's off by a degree or two it's
still going to be

532
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
still going to be
 

533
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,670
still going to be
it's going to give you a good idea oh

534
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
it's going to give you a good idea oh
 

535
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,670
it's going to give you a good idea oh
it's more than a degree i've i've seen

536
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
it's more than a degree i've i've seen
 

537
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,509
it's more than a degree i've i've seen
it register 100 degrees fahrenheit

538
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
it register 100 degrees fahrenheit
 

539
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,550
it register 100 degrees fahrenheit
outside

540
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
outside
 

541
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,509
outside
when the uh the weather um uh the local

542
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
when the uh the weather um uh the local
 

543
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,110
when the uh the weather um uh the local
weather station

544
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
weather station
 

545
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,310
weather station
uh which is at the local airport um is

546
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
uh which is at the local airport um is
 

547
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,430
uh which is at the local airport um is
reporting like

548
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
reporting like
 

549
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,509
reporting like
85 90 degrees fahrenheit could it be

550
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
85 90 degrees fahrenheit could it be
 

551
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,750
85 90 degrees fahrenheit could it be
like in direct sunlight or anything like

552
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
like in direct sunlight or anything like
 

553
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,829
like in direct sunlight or anything like
that no i

554
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
that no i
 

555
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,350
that no i
explicitly placed it so it would be in

556
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
explicitly placed it so it would be in
 

557
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,110
explicitly placed it so it would be in
shape no matter where the sun was

558
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
shape no matter where the sun was
 

559
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,949
shape no matter where the sun was
oh yeah so i was careful about doing

560
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
oh yeah so i was careful about doing
 

561
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,310
oh yeah so i was careful about doing
that so

562
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
that so
 

563
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,150
that so
yeah i don't know you know it's just a

564
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
yeah i don't know you know it's just a
 

565
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,350
yeah i don't know you know it's just a
bit of fun so

566
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
bit of fun so
 

567
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,990
bit of fun so
but it was i i did notice it was it was

568
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
but it was i i did notice it was it was
 

569
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,670
but it was i i did notice it was it was
specifically cooler

570
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
specifically cooler
 

571
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,190
specifically cooler
outside and i mean specifically cooler

572
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
outside and i mean specifically cooler
 

573
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,069
outside and i mean specifically cooler
downstairs

574
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
downstairs
 

575
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,590
downstairs
yes and uh and i did wonder uh why that

576
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
yes and uh and i did wonder uh why that
 

577
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,470
yes and uh and i did wonder uh why that
why that was or if it truly was and sure

578
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
why that was or if it truly was and sure
 

579
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,509
why that was or if it truly was and sure
enough it is so

580
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
enough it is so
 

581
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,389
enough it is so
yeah i showed a little usb dongle on

582
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
yeah i showed a little usb dongle on
 

583
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,509
yeah i showed a little usb dongle on
category 5

584
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
category 5
 

585
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,470
category 5
a while ago like back in old studios

586
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
a while ago like back in old studios
 

587
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,670
a while ago like back in old studios
studio d

588
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
studio d
 

589
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,949
studio d
um called the temper and it's just a

590
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
um called the temper and it's just a
 

591
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,910
um called the temper and it's just a
little 20

592
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
little 20
 

593
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,750
little 20
usb dongle it looks like a flash drive

594
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
usb dongle it looks like a flash drive
 

595
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,750
usb dongle it looks like a flash drive
and you plug it in and it gives you a

596
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
and you plug it in and it gives you a
 

597
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,550
and you plug it in and it gives you a
temperature

598
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
temperature
 

599
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,350
temperature
and humidity sensor for your computer

600
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360

 

601
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,750

really handy i love those things so i've

602
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
really handy i love those things so i've
 

603
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,030
really handy i love those things so i've
got one

604
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
got one
 

605
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,470
got one
i've got a couple in my house on

606
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
i've got a couple in my house on
 

607
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,790
i've got a couple in my house on
different floors and

608
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
different floors and
 

609
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,389
different floors and
i've got one here at the studio so i can

610
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
i've got one here at the studio so i can
 

611
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,509
i've got one here at the studio so i can
keep track of the temperature and

612
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
keep track of the temperature and
 

613
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,389
keep track of the temperature and
humidity here

614
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
humidity here
 

615
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,670
humidity here
and and i use that to like to just

616
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
and and i use that to like to just
 

617
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,470
and and i use that to like to just
monitor the

618
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
monitor the
 

619
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,630
monitor the
the temperature make sure that my server

620
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
the temperature make sure that my server
 

621
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,310
the temperature make sure that my server
room at home isn't too hot for example

622
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
room at home isn't too hot for example
 

623
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,750
room at home isn't too hot for example
maybe i should get a maybe i should get

624
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
maybe i should get a maybe i should get
 

625
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,110
maybe i should get a maybe i should get
a link for that because one of the

626
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
a link for that because one of the
 

627
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,190
a link for that because one of the
things i was curious about doing was

628
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
things i was curious about doing was
 

629
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,829
things i was curious about doing was
because it's wi-fi it's wireless yeah it

630
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
because it's wi-fi it's wireless yeah it
 

631
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,230
because it's wi-fi it's wireless yeah it
runs on like

632
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,240
runs on like
 

633
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,230
runs on like
433 degrees

634
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240

 

635
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,910

yeah something like that i think mine's

636
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
yeah something like that i think mine's
 

637
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,990
yeah something like that i think mine's
on 0.92 but it doesn't matter

638
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
on 0.92 but it doesn't matter
 

639
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,470
on 0.92 but it doesn't matter
in any case who's watching it is

640
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
in any case who's watching it is
 

641
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,550
in any case who's watching it is
specifically this frequency

642
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
specifically this frequency
 

643
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,230
specifically this frequency
if you want to tie it into pp9's

644
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
if you want to tie it into pp9's
 

645
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,389
if you want to tie it into pp9's
thermometer but the reason why is

646
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
thermometer but the reason why is
 

647
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,269
thermometer but the reason why is
because then i

648
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
because then i
 

649
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,630
because then i
actually tuned my ham radio to the

650
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
actually tuned my ham radio to the
 

651
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,150
actually tuned my ham radio to the
to that frequency and i could hear the

652
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
to that frequency and i could hear the
 

653
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,150
to that frequency and i could hear the
data bursts yeah and i was thinking

654
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
data bursts yeah and i was thinking
 

655
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,990
data bursts yeah and i was thinking
yeah oh yeah absolutely so i was

656
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
yeah oh yeah absolutely so i was
 

657
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,470
yeah oh yeah absolutely so i was
thinking maybe i could decode those

658
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
thinking maybe i could decode those
 

659
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,310
thinking maybe i could decode those
but if there's already devices that can

660
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
but if there's already devices that can
 

661
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,389
but if there's already devices that can
do that then

662
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
do that then
 

663
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,910
do that then
a good one and my one is on the uh was

664
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
a good one and my one is on the uh was
 

665
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,590
a good one and my one is on the uh was
on the input of the local

on the input of the local
 

667
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,870
on the input of the local

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
uhf repeater it doesn't call them in
 

669
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,629
uhf repeater it doesn't call them in
defense because it's too far away but

670
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
defense because it's too far away but
 

671
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,310

it's on the input to the
 

673
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:22,949
it's on the input to the
local ufs with beta

674
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959

 

675
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,069

yeah i'm trying to i'm pretty sure uh

676
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
yeah i'm trying to i'm pretty sure uh
 

677
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,710
yeah i'm trying to i'm pretty sure uh
for 433 megahertz is actually inside the

678
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
for 433 megahertz is actually inside the
 

679
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,230
for 433 megahertz is actually inside the
ham radio band isn't it

680
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
ham radio band isn't it
 

681
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,629
ham radio band isn't it
yeah it did yeah yeah it did interesting

682
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
yeah it did yeah yeah it did interesting
 

683
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,310
yeah it did yeah yeah it did interesting
okay i did not realize

684
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
okay i did not realize
 

685
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,910
okay i did not realize
i suspected it was and i meant to look

686
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
i suspected it was and i meant to look
 

687
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,269
i suspected it was and i meant to look
it up and it's been a while since i've

688
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
it up and it's been a while since i've
 

689
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:37,990
it up and it's been a while since i've
been on the air

690
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
been on the air
 

691
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,790
been on the air
so i needed to by the way

692
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800

 

693
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,829

oh very nice very good unfortunately my

694
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
oh very nice very good unfortunately my
 

695
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,870
oh very nice very good unfortunately my
antenna is down on the ground because um

696
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
antenna is down on the ground because um
 

697
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,750
antenna is down on the ground because um
i've had a whole bunch of trees taken

698
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
i've had a whole bunch of trees taken
 

699
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,389
i've had a whole bunch of trees taken
down

700
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
down
 

701
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,150
down
in the in the backyard because while i'm

702
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
in the in the backyard because while i'm
 

703
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,550
in the in the backyard because while i'm
home why not right so yeah

704
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
home why not right so yeah
 

705
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,750
home why not right so yeah
i had a tree come down and and uh

706
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
i had a tree come down and and uh
 

707
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,350
i had a tree come down and and uh
in the backyard and i had to get that

708
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
in the backyard and i had to get that
 

709
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,829
in the backyard and i had to get that
cleaned up and i took the opportunity to

710
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
cleaned up and i took the opportunity to
 

711
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,949
cleaned up and i took the opportunity to
tear down uh

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
tear down uh
 

713
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,470
tear down uh
to have a couple of more trees taken

714
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
to have a couple of more trees taken
 

715
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,990
to have a couple of more trees taken
down as well

716

uh you know what sort of power you're

740
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
uh you know what sort of power you're
 

741
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,069
uh you know what sort of power you're
running just 100 watts just running

in england yeah that's it what

766
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
in england yeah that's it what
 

767
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,710
in england yeah that's it what
wow okay thank you you'd still need an

768
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
wow okay thank you you'd still need an
 

769
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,550
wow okay thank you you'd still need an
amplifier for that though because uh

770
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
amplifier for that though because uh
 

771
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,069
amplifier for that though because uh
you know your your radio won't go oh god

772
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
you know your your radio won't go oh god
 

773
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,350
you know your your radio won't go oh god
my radio goes up 160 bucks okay turn the

774
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
my radio goes up 160 bucks okay turn the
 

775
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,350
my radio goes up 160 bucks okay turn the
drive down and uh and then i could draw

776
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
drive down and uh and then i could draw
 

777
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,230
drive down and uh and then i could draw
an amplifier but

778
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
an amplifier but
 

779
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,110
an amplifier but
uh the problem is all the other people

780
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
uh the problem is all the other people
 

781
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,829
uh the problem is all the other people
scandinavians the germans the french

scandinavians the germans the french
 

783
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,509
scandinavians the germans the french
and and white power and it gets a bit

784
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
and and white power and it gets a bit
 

785
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,629

dicey up from nature sometimes
 

787
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,670
dicey up from nature sometimes
you know yeah it is what it is do you

788
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
you know yeah it is what it is do you
 

789
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,670
you know yeah it is what it is do you
deal with that kind of interference from

790
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
deal with that kind of interference from
 

791
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,150
deal with that kind of interference from
other transmitters is that what you

792
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
other transmitters is that what you
 

793
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,350
other transmitters is that what you
you have to deal with

794
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360

 

795
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,670

it's called qrm uh man-made interference

796
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
it's called qrm uh man-made interference
 

797
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,470
it's called qrm uh man-made interference
as opposed to qr in november which is

3.1 usb c hub okay so
 

1263
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,909
3.1 usb c hub okay so
so i should be able to get full speed

1264
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
so i should be able to get full speed
 

1265
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,470
so i should be able to get full speed
out of these at usb 3 speeds

1266
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
out of these at usb 3 speeds
 

1267
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,270
out of these at usb 3 speeds
each one same time all at the same time

um with like some bandwidth sharing of

1272
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
um with like some bandwidth sharing of
 

1273
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,110
um with like some bandwidth sharing of
course because

1274
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
course because
 

1275
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,750
course because
3.1 but 3.1 is what like 10 gigabits a

1276
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
3.1 but 3.1 is what like 10 gigabits a
 

1277
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,110

second or something like that

1278
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
second or something like that
 

1279
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,870
second or something like that
if i recall correctly so it's it's

ridiculous so what i should be able to
 

1283
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,789
ridiculous so what i should be able to
do is take each camera card plug it in

1284
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
do is take each camera card plug it in
 

1285
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,870
do is take each camera card plug it in
so all three cameras plus this sound

00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
and be able to edit directly through
 

1295
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,750
and be able to edit directly through
this

1296
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
this
 

1297
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,350
this
so i'll be able to import the files

1298
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
so i'll be able to import the files
 

1299
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,029
so i'll be able to import the files
directly into davinci resolve

1300
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
directly into davinci resolve
 

1301
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,549
directly into davinci resolve
without having to copy them to the hard

1302
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
without having to copy them to the hard
 

1303
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,549
without having to copy them to the hard
drive and that's why you need the

1304
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
drive and that's why you need the
 

1305
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,350
drive and that's why you need the
clapboard

1306
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
clapboard
 

1307
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,909
clapboard
now i get it because you have to sync up

1308
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
now i get it because you have to sync up
 

1309
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,750
now i get it because you have to sync up
all four of those separate

1310
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
all four of those separate
 

1311
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,870
all four of those separate
files individually exactly yeah wow so

1312
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
files individually exactly yeah wow so
 

1313
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,230
files individually exactly yeah wow so
the clapboard gives me

1314
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
the clapboard gives me
 

1315
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,669
the clapboard gives me
what it does is you look at the

1316
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
what it does is you look at the
 

1317
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,510
what it does is you look at the
wavetable no

1318
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
wavetable no
 

1319
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,789
wavetable no
sorry peter

1320
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
sorry peter
 

1321
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,630
sorry peter
waveform you look at the waveform i'm

1322
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
waveform you look at the waveform i'm
 

1323
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,029
waveform you look at the waveform i'm
i'm an old old-school dj so i still say

1324
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
i'm an old old-school dj so i still say
 

1325
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,230
i'm an old old-school dj so i still say
wave table

1326
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
wave table
 

1327
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,549
wave table
because that was a synthesis that we

1328
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
because that was a synthesis that we
 

1329
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,669
because that was a synthesis that we
used to use

1330
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
used to use
 

1331
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,269
used to use
and probably still do um

1332
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
and probably still do um
 

1333
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,510
and probably still do um
yeah so you look at the waveform you

1334
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
yeah so you look at the waveform you
 

1335
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,950
yeah so you look at the waveform you
look at the waveform and

1336
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
look at the waveform and
 

1337
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,789
look at the waveform and
as soon as that clapboard hits you see a

1338
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
as soon as that clapboard hits you see a
 

1339
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,310
as soon as that clapboard hits you see a
big spike it's like a high heat

1340
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
big spike it's like a high heat
 

1341
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,990
big spike it's like a high heat
just go like that so then you just line

1342
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
just go like that so then you just line
 

1343
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,750
just go like that so then you just line
up those spikes and boom you're done it

1344
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
up those spikes and boom you're done it
 

1345
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,230
up those spikes and boom you're done it
just saves you so much work so

1346
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
just saves you so much work so
 

1347
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,430
just saves you so much work so
that's gonna save probably on

1348
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,440
that's gonna save probably on
 

1349
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,750
that's gonna save probably on
an average show night so on a wednesday

1350
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
an average show night so on a wednesday
 

1351
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,190
an average show night so on a wednesday
night that's gonna save about

1352
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,200
night that's gonna save about
 

1353
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,110
night that's gonna save about
two hours worth of waiting right there

1354
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
two hours worth of waiting right there
 

1355
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,190
two hours worth of waiting right there
and i can just get straight from record

1356
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
and i can just get straight from record
 

1357
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,630
and i can just get straight from record
into editing

1358
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
into editing
 

1359
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,310
into editing
right in one fell swoop just plug them

1360
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
right in one fell swoop just plug them
 

1361
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,230
right in one fell swoop just plug them
in and be ready to go

1362
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
in and be ready to go
 

1363
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,789
in and be ready to go
so i mean two hours is a perfect perfect

1364
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
so i mean two hours is a perfect perfect
 

1365
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,549
so i mean two hours is a perfect perfect
time for you to go get something to eat

1366
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
time for you to go get something to eat
 

1367
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,070
time for you to go get something to eat
while you're waiting on uh

1368
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
while you're waiting on uh
 

1369
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,350
while you're waiting on uh
while you're waiting for the files to

1370
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
while you're waiting for the files to
 

1371
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,870
while you're waiting for the files to
come no i don't i don't even have to

1372
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
come no i don't i don't even have to
 

1373
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,149
come no i don't i don't even have to
copy them anymore

1374
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
copy them anymore
 

1375
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,149
copy them anymore
i'll be able to edit them directly on

1376
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
i'll be able to edit them directly on
 

1377
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,909
i'll be able to edit them directly on
those drives they're fast enough

1378
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
those drives they're fast enough
 

1379
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,310
those drives they're fast enough
so so needless to say so the difference

1380
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
so so needless to say so the difference
 

1381
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,510
so so needless to say so the difference
in price to the four

1382
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
in price to the four
 

1383
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,549
in price to the four
unit um this was like 14 bucks for the

1384
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
unit um this was like 14 bucks for the
 

1385
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,029
unit um this was like 14 bucks for the
hub

1386
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
hub
 

1387
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,390
hub
and eight bucks per sd card reader

1388
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
and eight bucks per sd card reader
 

1389
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,549
and eight bucks per sd card reader
so you know you do the math i didn't do

1390
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
so you know you do the math i didn't do
 

1391
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,350
so you know you do the math i didn't do
the math it's a lot less than 120 bucks

1392
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
the math it's a lot less than 120 bucks
 

1393
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,470
the math it's a lot less than 120 bucks
so so i have a question

1394
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
so so i have a question
 

1395
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,110
so so i have a question
i have a rotating hard drive still in my

1396
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
i have a rotating hard drive still in my
 

1397
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,909
i have a rotating hard drive still in my
main machine

1398
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
main machine
 

1399
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,510
main machine
yeah and it i feel like the machine is

1400
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
yeah and it i feel like the machine is
 

1401
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,029
yeah and it i feel like the machine is
running slower

1402
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
running slower
 

1403
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,470
running slower
because the hard drive might be old and

1404
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
because the hard drive might be old and
 

1405
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,590
because the hard drive might be old and
and getting decrepit or whatever i may

1406
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
and getting decrepit or whatever i may
 

1407
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,029
and getting decrepit or whatever i may
have asked this before

1408
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
have asked this before
 

1409
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,350
have asked this before
replacing it with an ssd is certainly

1410
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
replacing it with an ssd is certainly
 

1411
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,070
replacing it with an ssd is certainly
doable i have no problem doing that

1412
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
doable i have no problem doing that
 

1413
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,789
doable i have no problem doing that
question is do you think the reliability

1414
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
question is do you think the reliability
 

1415
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,870
question is do you think the reliability
the reliability of the ssd

1416
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
the reliability of the ssd
 

1417
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,830
the reliability of the ssd
is going to be as good as uh spinning

1418
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
is going to be as good as uh spinning
 

1419
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,390
is going to be as good as uh spinning
drive

1420
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
drive
 

1421
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,630
drive
these days now we have as we general

1422
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
these days now we have as we general
 

1423
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,510
these days now we have as we general
drive

1424
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
drive
 

1425
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,149
drive
read write all that mess right yeah yeah

1426
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
read write all that mess right yeah yeah
 

1427
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:10,549
read write all that mess right yeah yeah
um

1428
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
um
 

1429
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,310
um
so first thing that i would look at bp9

1430
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
so first thing that i would look at bp9
 

1431
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,310
so first thing that i would look at bp9
is how much ram how much ram is in that

1432
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
is how much ram how much ram is in that
 

1433
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,230
is how much ram how much ram is in that
system

1434
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
system
 

1435
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,029
system
uh i want to say a gig okay so just keep

1436
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039
uh i want to say a gig okay so just keep
 

1437
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,590
uh i want to say a gig okay so just keep
in mind

1438
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
in mind
 

1439
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,350
in mind
anytime you start swapping that's going

1440
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,360
anytime you start swapping that's going
 

1441
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,710
anytime you start swapping that's going
to be using the drive so that will

1442
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
to be using the drive so that will
 

1443
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,230
to be using the drive so that will
definitely slow things down

1444
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
definitely slow things down
 

1445
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,909
definitely slow things down
i don't i don't believe it's i don't

1446
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
i don't i don't believe it's i don't
 

1447
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,750
i don't i don't believe it's i don't
believe that any of the work that i've

1448
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
believe that any of the work that i've
 

1449
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,230
believe that any of the work that i've
done is

1450
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
done is
 

1451
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,510
done is
has has caused it to swap out okay so

1452
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
has has caused it to swap out okay so
 

1453
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,789
has has caused it to swap out okay so
ssd yeah when ssds first came out we had

1454
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
ssd yeah when ssds first came out we had
 

1455
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,830
ssd yeah when ssds first came out we had
a concern about the read writes

1456
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840
a concern about the read writes
 

1457
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,710
a concern about the read writes
um like killing the life

1458
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
um like killing the life
 

1459
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,710
um like killing the life
lifetime of these things and failing

1460
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
lifetime of these things and failing
 

1461
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,549
lifetime of these things and failing
right right

1462
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
right right
 

1463
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,750
right right
these days i don't think that's an issue

1464
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
these days i don't think that's an issue
 

1465
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,630
these days i don't think that's an issue
i mean really realistically the the

1466
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
i mean really realistically the the
 

1467
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,789
i mean really realistically the the
technology has grown so much

1468
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
technology has grown so much
 

1469
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,789
technology has grown so much
and becomes so stable that

1470
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
and becomes so stable that
 

1471
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,310
and becomes so stable that
you're not you're not going to have any

1472
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
you're not you're not going to have any
 

1473
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,149
you're not you're not going to have any
more trouble with an ssd

1474
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:00,159
more trouble with an ssd
 

1475
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,710
more trouble with an ssd
a decent ssd than you would with a

1476
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
a decent ssd than you would with a
 

1477
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,390
a decent ssd than you would with a
standard spinner

1478
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,400
standard spinner
 

1479
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,029
standard spinner
i have eight gig in the machine yeah uh

1480
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,039
i have eight gig in the machine yeah uh
 

1481
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,990
i have eight gig in the machine yeah uh
it looks like

1482
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
it looks like
 

1483
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,630
it looks like
about uh two and a half gig is committed

1484
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640
about uh two and a half gig is committed
 

1485
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,590
about uh two and a half gig is committed
right now

1486
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
right now
 

1487
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,190
right now
and zero swap at the moment perfect

1488
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
and zero swap at the moment perfect
 

1489
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,909
and zero swap at the moment perfect
that's not swapping at all yeah so yeah

1490
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
that's not swapping at all yeah so yeah
 

1491
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,029
that's not swapping at all yeah so yeah
i deliberately put

1492
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:19,039
i deliberately put
 

1493
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,950
i deliberately put
enough memory in it to make sure it

1494
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
enough memory in it to make sure it
 

1495
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,389
enough memory in it to make sure it
didn't swap unless

1496
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399
didn't swap unless
 

1497
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,590
didn't swap unless
there is swap space in case it needs it

1498
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
there is swap space in case it needs it
 

1499
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,070
there is swap space in case it needs it
but i honestly it just hasn't uh hasn't

1500
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,080
but i honestly it just hasn't uh hasn't
 

1501
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,950
but i honestly it just hasn't uh hasn't
had to use it

1502
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
had to use it
 

1503
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,430
had to use it
so um what i would stay away from is

1504
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
so um what i would stay away from is
 

1505
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,430
so um what i would stay away from is
like like sd card storage

1506
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
like like sd card storage
 

1507
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,230
like like sd card storage
is agreed i find that even with the

1508
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
is agreed i find that even with the
 

1509
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,510
is agreed i find that even with the
raspberry pi

1510
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
raspberry pi
 

1511
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,710
raspberry pi
sure yeah um emmc is an

1512
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
sure yeah um emmc is an
 

1513
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,750
sure yeah um emmc is an
uh is a step in the right direction

1514
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:43,760
uh is a step in the right direction
 

1515
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,870
uh is a step in the right direction
ssd is now taking it to the next level

1516
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
ssd is now taking it to the next level
 

1517
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,950
ssd is now taking it to the next level
and is very very very reliable

1518
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
and is very very very reliable
 

1519
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,470
and is very very very reliable
especially if you get into data center

1520
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
especially if you get into data center
 

1521
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,070
especially if you get into data center
storage so like the

1522
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
storage so like the
 

1523
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,430
storage so like the
dc 400s dc 500s from kingston um those

1524
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
dc 400s dc 500s from kingston um those
 

1525
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,669
dc 400s dc 500s from kingston um those
are

1526
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
are
 

1527
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,909
are
really like they are meant to be always

1528
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
really like they are meant to be always
 

1529
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,149
really like they are meant to be always
on always reading always writing

1530
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:00,159
on always reading always writing
 

1531
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,710
on always reading always writing
and they can handle any kind of abuse

1532
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
and they can handle any kind of abuse
 

1533
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,990
and they can handle any kind of abuse
you throw at them

1534
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
you throw at them
 

1535
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,190
you throw at them
and then things like m.2s

1536
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200
and then things like m.2s
 

1537
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,110
and then things like m.2s
um nvme drives are very very reliable

1538
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
um nvme drives are very very reliable
 

1539
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,669
um nvme drives are very very reliable
now

1540
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
now
 

1541
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,789
now
i have had one nvme drive fail on me

1542
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799
i have had one nvme drive fail on me
 

1543
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,950
i have had one nvme drive fail on me
but they fail in an interesting way i

1544
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
but they fail in an interesting way i
 

1545
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,070
but they fail in an interesting way i
mean they can

1546
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
mean they can
 

1547
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,590
mean they can
sometimes they can just fail like their

1548
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
sometimes they can just fail like their
 

1549
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,149
sometimes they can just fail like their
ssd right you want to have a backup

1550
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
ssd right you want to have a backup
 

1551
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,430
ssd right you want to have a backup
it's not like a spinner where you can

1552
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
it's not like a spinner where you can
 

1553
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,590
it's not like a spinner where you can
replace the heads and be

1554
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
replace the heads and be

replace the heads and be
able to copy your files off when mine

1556
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:28,399
able to copy your files off when mine
 

1557
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,070
able to copy your files off when mine
failed i was able to

1558
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
failed i was able to
 

1559
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,269
failed i was able to
get the data off of it but you can't

1560
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
get the data off of it but you can't
 

1561
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,190
get the data off of it but you can't
but i couldn't use it to boot from like

1562
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
but i couldn't use it to boot from like
 

1563
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,190
but i couldn't use it to boot from like
it was just it was corrupted in some

1564
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
it was just it was corrupted in some
 

1565
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,149
it was just it was corrupted in some
strange way

1566
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,159
strange way
 

1567
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,909
strange way
that's the biggest concern i have about

1568
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:39,919
that's the biggest concern i have about
 

1569
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,430
that's the biggest concern i have about
ssds is that they failed

1570
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
ssds is that they failed
 

1571
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,710
ssds is that they failed
catastrophically

1572
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
catastrophically
 

1573
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,070
catastrophically
that's always it's so funny you're done

1574
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,080
that's always it's so funny you're done
 

1575
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,110
that's always it's so funny you're done
right whereas uh at least with a with

1576
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
right whereas uh at least with a with
 

1577
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,789
right whereas uh at least with a with
as you say with a spinning drive there's

1578
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
as you say with a spinning drive there's
 

1579
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,549
as you say with a spinning drive there's
some chance you could get the data off

1580
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:52,559
some chance you could get the data off
 

1581
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:52,950
some chance you could get the data off
it

1582
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
it
 

1583
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,470
it
correct yeah so backups

1584
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
correct yeah so backups
 

1585
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,630
correct yeah so backups
absolutely and so for people people like

have to have

1590
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
have to have
 

1591
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,230
have to have
good reliable backups at all times um

1592
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,240
good reliable backups at all times um
 

1593
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,990
good reliable backups at all times um
never have your data in one place at a

1594
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
never have your data in one place at a
 

1595

time
it's always going to be two three places

1598
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
it's always going to be two three places
 

1599
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,070
it's always going to be two three places
at any given time

conditions
 

1617
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,950
conditions
it's the reads and writes the constant

1618
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
it's the reads and writes the constant

um right i think you're probably gonna

1622
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,640
um right i think you're probably gonna

theoretically and technically an ssd

1624
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
theoretically and technically an ssd
 

1625
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,310
theoretically and technically an ssd
should should live longer in that

1626
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
should should live longer in that
 

1627
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,750
should should live longer in that
scenario because it's not

1628
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
scenario because it's not
 

1629
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,669
scenario because it's not
it doesn't have any moving mechanisms so

1630
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
it doesn't have any moving mechanisms so
 

1631
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,870
it doesn't have any moving mechanisms so
when it's idle

when it's idle
 

1633
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,430
when it's idle
it's doing nothing yep it's doing

1634
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
it's doing nothing yep it's doing
 

1635
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,870
it's doing nothing yep it's doing
literally nothing

1636
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
literally nothing
 

1637
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,710
literally nothing
so the only time that the ssd is

1638
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
so the only time that the ssd is
 

1639
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,549
so the only time that the ssd is
actually being is doing anything is when

1640
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
actually being is doing anything is when
 

1641
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,470
actually being is doing anything is when
it's reading or writing

1642
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
it's reading or writing
 

1643
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,710
it's reading or writing

1713
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,149
development environment as silly as it
is do you want to know my solution

1714
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
is do you want to know my solution
 

1715
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,509
is do you want to know my solution
not good no i have i have a

1716
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:13,519
not good no i have i have a
 

1717
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,710
not good no i have i have a
a windows machine that i have google

1718
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:16,720
a windows machine that i have google
 

1719
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,549

remote desktop setup
 

1721
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,590
remote desktop setup
and so i don't do remote desktop well

1722
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
and so i don't do remote desktop well
 

1723
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,269
and so i don't do remote desktop well
google remote desktop is different than

google remote desktop is different than
 

1725
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,590
google remote desktop is different than
remote desktop it's not rdp protocol

remote desktop it's not rdp protocol
 

1727
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,750
remote desktop it's not rdp protocol
and it uses two-factor authentication in

1728
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
and it uses two-factor authentication in
 

1729
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,389
and it uses two-factor authentication in
order to gain access to the device so

1730
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
order to gain access to the device so
 

1731
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,070
order to gain access to the device so
it's it's safe so i actually have

1732
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
it's it's safe so i actually have
 

1733
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,750
it's it's safe so i actually have
multi-factor authentication

1734
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
multi-factor authentication
 

1735
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,149

1753
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,669

and click on the computer and then it

1754
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:51,679
and click on the computer and then it
 

1755
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,430
and click on the computer and then it
asks me for the pin for the computer so

1756
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
asks me for the pin for the computer so
 

1757
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,950
asks me for the pin for the computer so
there's three factors

1758
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
there's three factors
 

1759
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,950
there's three factors
in order to gain access to the computer

1760
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
in order to gain access to the computer
 

1761
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,389
in order to gain access to the computer
itself then

1762
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:58,399
itself then
 

1763
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,070
itself then
once i connect to the computer i have to

1764
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
once i connect to the computer i have to
 

1765
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,909
once i connect to the computer i have to
also log in as the user

1766
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
also log in as the user
 

1767
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,190
also log in as the user
on the local machine so for four factors

1768
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
on the local machine so for four factors
 

1769
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,750
on the local machine so for four factors
to get in so unlike rdp which is

1770
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
to get in so unlike rdp which is
 

1771
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,750
to get in so unlike rdp which is
extremely insecure

1772
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
