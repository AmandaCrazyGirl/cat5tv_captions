a arm or armhv
architecture which is going to be

650
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
architecture which is going to be
 

651
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,870
architecture which is going to be
interesting

in the other system that yeah the the um
 

959
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,510
in the other system that yeah the the um
slower system uh it had the hard drive

960
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
slower system uh it had the hard drive
 

961
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,190
slower system uh it had the hard drive
with almost a year old uh something so

962
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
with almost a year old uh something so
 

963
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,150
with almost a year old uh something so
it's um relatively new i just moved it

to the
 

967
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,110
to the
new system so yeah and i also have a

968
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
new system so yeah and i also have a
 

969
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,029
new system so yeah and i also have a
curved um two screens and they came

970
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
curved um two screens and they came
 

971
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,470
curved um two screens and they came
along with their

972
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
along with their
 

973
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,270
along with their
um so one of those things it's a curved

974
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
um so one of those things it's a curved
 

975
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,310
um so one of those things it's a curved
one and it's and

976

one and it's and
 

977
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,669
one and it's and
still uh adapting to uh

978
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679

 

979
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,549

times i had a hard time switching from

980
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
times i had a hard time switching from
 

981
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,150
times i had a hard time switching from
two smaller screens

982
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
two smaller screens
 

983
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,430
two smaller screens
to one huge screen i had a hard time

984
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
to one huge screen i had a hard time
 

985
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,470
to one huge screen i had a hard time
with that because

986
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
with that because
 

987
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,110
with that because
when you have two smaller screens you

988
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
when you have two smaller screens you
 

989
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,669
when you have two smaller screens you
can

990
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
can
 

991
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,669
can
what i did specifically i had a fairly

992
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
what i did specifically i had a fairly
 

993
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,190
what i did specifically i had a fairly
large screen as my main screen

994
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
large screen as my main screen
 

995
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,710
large screen as my main screen
and then a smaller screen off to the

996
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
and then a smaller screen off to the
 

997
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,350
and then a smaller screen off to the
side and in fact i had the laptop screen

998
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
side and in fact i had the laptop screen
 

999
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,789
side and in fact i had the laptop screen
open this is at work

1000
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
open this is at work
 

1001
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,110
open this is at work
the laptop screen open as well so i

1002
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
the laptop screen open as well so i
 

1003
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,110
the laptop screen open as well so i
could work on the main screen

1004
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
could work on the main screen
 

1005
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,190
could work on the main screen
and then drag off the windows to

1006
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
and then drag off the windows to
 

1007
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,190
and then drag off the windows to
subsidiary screens whenever i

1008
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
subsidiary screens whenever i
 

1009
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,270
subsidiary screens whenever i
didn't want to work on that right away

1010
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
didn't want to work on that right away
 

1011
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,630
didn't want to work on that right away
even expand on there

1012
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
even expand on there
 

1013
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,270
even expand on there
and now it wouldn't blow up on the hole

1014
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
and now it wouldn't blow up on the hole
 

1015
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,950
and now it wouldn't blow up on the hole
like the problem you'll have solder is

1016
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
like the problem you'll have solder is
 

1017
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,150
like the problem you'll have solder is
with your curved screen

1018
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
with your curved screen
 

1019
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,470
with your curved screen
it'll all when you expand the window

1020
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
it'll all when you expand the window
 

1021
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,430
it'll all when you expand the window
it'll it'll go

1022
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
it'll it'll go
 

1023
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,270
it'll it'll go
all over your main screen and you don't

1024
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
all over your main screen and you don't
 

1025
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,950
all over your main screen and you don't
have any room for any of it

1026
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
have any room for any of it
 

1027
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,990
have any room for any of it
yeah but i kind of like

1028
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000

 

1029
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,110

having everything um and maximized so

1030
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
having everything um and maximized so
 

1031
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,750
having everything um and maximized so
yes

1032
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
yes
 

1033
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,350
yes
only one window is visible at the same

1034
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
only one window is visible at the same
 

1035
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,190
only one window is visible at the same
time it's how i

1036
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
time it's how i
 

1037
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,230
time it's how i
usually am it's how i do things but

1038
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
usually am it's how i do things but
 

1039
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,950
usually am it's how i do things but
the first thing that was strange was uh

1040
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
the first thing that was strange was uh
 

1041
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,310
the first thing that was strange was uh
setting up the first system

1042
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,320
setting up the first system
 

1043
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,830
setting up the first system
and then comparing um and then comparing

1044
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
and then comparing um and then comparing
 

1045
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,029
and then comparing um and then comparing
um

1046
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
um
 

1047
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,350
um
alongside the the other screen that was

1048
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
alongside the the other screen that was
 

1049
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,390
alongside the the other screen that was
still here

1050
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
still here
 

1051
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,029
still here
and then i noticed uh how bad the old

1052
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
and then i noticed uh how bad the old
 

1053
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,310
and then i noticed uh how bad the old
screen really was

1054
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
screen really was
 

1055
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,510
screen really was
when i had a really good so it's

1056
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
when i had a really good so it's
 

1057
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,470
when i had a really good so it's
probably really

1058
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
probably really
 

1059
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,630
probably really
dim and you don't even notice it because

1060
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
dim and you don't even notice it because
 

1061
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,510
dim and you don't even notice it because
it happens so

1062
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
it happens so
 

1063
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,430
it happens so
gradually that you don't even notice it

1064
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
gradually that you don't even notice it
 

1065
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,789
gradually that you don't even notice it
happening right yeah

1066
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
happening right yeah
 

1067
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,830
happening right yeah
um on on so on bp9's point

1068
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
um on on so on bp9's point
 

1069
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,270
um on on so on bp9's point
i i'm sure this is probably both of you

1070
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
i i'm sure this is probably both of you
 

1071
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,830
i i'm sure this is probably both of you
but

1072
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
but
 

1073
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,909
but
uh have i frozen oh there i am no you're

1074
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
uh have i frozen oh there i am no you're
 

1075
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,590
uh have i frozen oh there i am no you're
not you're good this is probably pretty

1076
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
not you're good this is probably pretty
 

1077
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,470
not you're good this is probably pretty
obvious but

1078
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
obvious but
 

1079
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,430
obvious but
on both windows 10 and any modern linux

1080
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
on both windows 10 and any modern linux
 

1081
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,630
on both windows 10 and any modern linux
desktop that i've seen

1082
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
desktop that i've seen
 

1083
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,110
desktop that i've seen
if you drag your window all the way to

1084
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
if you drag your window all the way to
 

1085
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,830
if you drag your window all the way to
the left or

1086
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
the left or
 

1087
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,669
the left or
all the way to the right or even all the

1088
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
all the way to the right or even all the
 

1089
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,870
all the way to the right or even all the
way to the top or all the way to the

1090
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
way to the top or all the way to the
 

1091
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,070
way to the top or all the way to the
bottom it will actually

1092
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
bottom it will actually
 

1093
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,149
bottom it will actually
split it it will maximize it and split

1094
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
split it it will maximize it and split
 

1095
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,390
split it it will maximize it and split
it so you can drag one to the very very

1096
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
it so you can drag one to the very very
 

1097
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,990
it so you can drag one to the very very
far left and let go and it will only

1098
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
far left and let go and it will only
 

1099
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,510
far left and let go and it will only
take up half of the screen

1100
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
take up half of the screen
 

1101
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,870
take up half of the screen
then take another one and drag it all

1102
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
then take another one and drag it all
 

1103
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,990
then take another one and drag it all
the way to the right and it will only

1104
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
the way to the right and it will only
 

1105
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,510
the way to the right and it will only
take up the right hand side

1106
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
take up the right hand side
 

1107
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,029
take up the right hand side
so i think they've accommodated that

1108
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
so i think they've accommodated that
 

1109
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,190
so i think they've accommodated that
like major but i know exactly what

1110
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
like major but i know exactly what
 

1111
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,070
like major but i know exactly what
you're talking about and that's why i

1112
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
you're talking about and that's why i
 

1113
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,990
you're talking about and that's why i
got screens all around me

1114
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000

10 on one screen
 

1121
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,549
10 on one screen
because internally we use that for

1122
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
because internally we use that for
 

1123
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,789
because internally we use that for
communication unfortunately and i got

1124

mint on my screen in front of me and
 

1127
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,310
mint on my screen in front of me and
then i've got another windows machine

uh it's going to take a couple weeks for
 

1469
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,350
uh it's going to take a couple weeks for
me to kind of get the momentum going and

1470
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
me to kind of get the momentum going and
 

1471
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,149

00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
vacuuming up sawdust and and and
 

1483
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,110
vacuuming up sawdust and and and
finishing the wiring and getting

1484
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
finishing the wiring and getting
 

1485
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,070

um and then i gotta shoot some video for
 

1489
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,830
um and then i gotta shoot some video for
the show on wednesday

1490
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840

 

1491
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:15,430

um

1492
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,440

 

1493
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,190

you're going to control the rotator with

1494
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,200
you're going to control the rotator with
 

1495
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,430
you're going to control the rotator with
the raspberry pi yeah

1496
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,440
the raspberry pi yeah
 

1497
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,789
the raspberry pi yeah
right yeah and your d converted it all

1498
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
right yeah and your d converted it all
 

1499
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,950
right yeah and your d converted it all
out

1500
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
out
 

1501
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,029
out
what's that a to d h d converter is an

1502
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
what's that a to d h d converter is an
 

1503
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,190
what's that a to d h d converter is an
analog to digital converter oh yeah yeah

1504
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
analog to digital converter oh yeah yeah
 

1505
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,990
analog to digital converter oh yeah yeah
yeah

1506
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
yeah
 

1507
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,269
yeah
it's very cool

1508
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279

 

1509
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,870

i think that's what's neat about like

1510
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:40,880
i think that's what's neat about like
 

1511
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,549
i think that's what's neat about like
single board computers you can use them

1512
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,559
single board computers you can use them
 

1513
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,590
single board computers you can use them
for anything

1514
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:43,600
for anything
 

1515
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,710
for anything
you know a question i said how many uh

1516
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
you know a question i said how many uh
 

1517
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,230
you know a question i said how many uh
a today converters are on the pi

1518
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240

 

1519
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,789

how many hd converters are on the

1520
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:56,799
how many hd converters are on the
 

1521
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,710
how many hd converters are on the
raspberry pi oh i don't know you'd have

1522
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
raspberry pi oh i don't know you'd have
 

1523
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,149
raspberry pi oh i don't know you'd have
to

1524
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
to
 

1525
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,789
to
the spec diagram that would i agree

1526
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:02,799
the spec diagram that would i agree
 

1527
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,430
the spec diagram that would i agree
there are

1528
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
there are
 

1529
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,909
there are
there are gpio pins there are digital

1530
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
there are gpio pins there are digital
 

1531
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,830
there are gpio pins there are digital
and analog pins but i don't know if

1532
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
and analog pins but i don't know if
 

1533
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,549
and analog pins but i don't know if
they're

1534
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559
they're
 

1535
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,310
