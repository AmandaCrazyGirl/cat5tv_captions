must be like if you were using it

466
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:04,679
must be like if you were using it
 

467
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,189
must be like if you were using it
non-stop for 21 hours but who does that

468
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
non-stop for 21 hours but who does that
 

469

battery life but that that will last for

480
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:22,529
battery life but that that will last for
 

481
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,499
battery life but that that will last for
a month before I have to put it on the

hour battery I wired up this USB hub to

496
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:07,379
hour battery I wired up this USB hub to
 

497
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:16,059
hour battery I wired up this USB hub to
it so that I could connect let's see a

498

and this one running Android just
 

503
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:26,480
and this one running Android just
because the C 0 runs Android really

504
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,490
because the C 0 runs Android really
 

505
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,350

I might get a pine phone though they're
 

511
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:52,789
I might get a pine phone though they're
still viable if you want to remember

that the graphics driver we have then
 

537
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,130
that the graphics driver we have then
the kernel now is actually binary blob

538

the kernel now is actually binary blob
 

539
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,930

came up with this think of the lima
 

547
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,630
came up with this think of the lima
driver and it got excited the kernel so

548
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:11,640
driver and it got excited the kernel so
 

549
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,550
driver and it got excited the kernel so
that's that's cool yeah so this is not a

definitely because of the software work
 

597
00:19:48,030 --> 00:20:01,100
definitely because of the software work
that they're doing and is the kind of

upfront about how alpha quality the
 

605
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,570
upfront about how alpha quality the

606
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:11,580
software is the point where they
 

607
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,909
software is the point where they
released like you know the first few

608
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
released like you know the first few
 

609

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,100
we're gonna give ship these out to
people or whatever and it's like yeah I

620
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,110
people or whatever and it's like yeah I
 

621
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,140
people or whatever and it's like yeah I
think probably I mean it makes sense

622
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,150
think probably I mean it makes sense
 

623
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,880
think probably I mean it makes sense
that they do want to test the software

624
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:31,890
that they do want to test the software
 

625
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,799
that they do want to test the software
and have the community develop it with

626
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:33,809
and have the community develop it with
 

627
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,820
and have the community develop it with
them but at the same time it's I mean

628
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:36,830
them but at the same time it's I mean
 

629
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,980
them but at the same time it's I mean
they they could be a little bit more

630
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:39,990
they they could be a little bit more
 

631
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,049
they they could be a little bit more
upfront about how alpha quality the

632
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:42,059
upfront about how alpha quality the
 

633
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,930
upfront about how alpha quality the
software is yeah I think it's a fine

634
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:44,940
software is yeah I think it's a fine
 

635
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,169
software is yeah I think it's a fine

the same time so yeah but the thing is
 

641
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,700
the same time so yeah but the thing is
when you when you charge a premium price

like that there's an expectation that it
 

645
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:09,799
like that there's an expectation that it
should work still you can't charge seven

646
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:09,809
should work still you can't charge seven

developments happening pretty much I
 

767
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,080

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,290
in rust right now rough and from what I
can tell it doesn't actually run a full

about it I think it's not but if you
 

785
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,220
about it I think it's not but if you
could develop like if they if they can

complete watch I thought I was trying to

798
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,030
complete watch I thought I was trying to
 

799
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,270
complete watch I thought I was trying to
get it I couldn't get out I just thought

800
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,280
get it I couldn't get out I just thought
 

801
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,550
get it I couldn't get out I just thought
oh oh maybe it maybe that's change

802
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:22,560
oh oh maybe it maybe that's change
 

803
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,900
oh oh maybe it maybe that's change
reason you know I think I should

804
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:26,910
reason you know I think I should
 

805
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,750
reason you know I think I should
absolutely check that out I'd love like

806
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
absolutely check that out I'd love like
 

807
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,390
absolutely check that out I'd love like
to create an app for that your system

808
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
to create an app for that your system
 

809
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,830
to create an app for that your system
admins that would be like a notification

810
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
admins that would be like a notification
 

811
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,340
admins that would be like a notification
app just just imagine looking at your

812
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,350
app just just imagine looking at your
 

813
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,200
app just just imagine looking at your
watch and being able to tell the status

814
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,210
watch and being able to tell the status
 

815
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,150
watch and being able to tell the status
and all your surveys and Robin it has a

816
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,160
and all your surveys and Robin it has a
 

817
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,450
and all your surveys and Robin it has a
heart rate sensor in the pine time watch

818
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,460
heart rate sensor in the pine time watch
 

819
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,870
heart rate sensor in the pine time watch
I said now I don't know if it is if it's

820
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
I said now I don't know if it is if it's
 

821
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,460
I said now I don't know if it is if it's
a slick as the as a smart badge but it

822
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,470
a slick as the as a smart badge but it
 

823
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,320
a slick as the as a smart badge but it
certainly has it it took me has a heart

824
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,330
certainly has it it took me has a heart
 

825

rate sensor so here you go Robbie yet

826
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,120
rate sensor so here you go Robbie yet
 

827
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,749
rate sensor so here you go Robbie yet
you can have MEMS monitor your

828
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:02,759
you can have MEMS monitor your
 

829
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,329

your health would that be neat there you

830
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:05,339
your health would that be neat there you
 

831
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:05,869

go

832
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:05,879
go
 

833
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:08,869
go
add a sensor for it crushed over the

834
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:08,879
add a sensor for it crushed over the
 

835
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:12,469
add a sensor for it crushed over the
data would be going fine time kiddos

836
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:12,479
data would be going fine time kiddos
 

837
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:16,249
