165
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,229
have i frozen again you have but i can
still hear you

166
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
still hear you
 

167
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,110
still hear you
but i can see all right um so it's rgb

168
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
but i can see all right um so it's rgb
 

169
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,270
but i can see all right um so it's rgb
receiver so

170
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
receiver so
 

171
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,990
receiver so
white i can use the red green blue

172
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
white i can use the red green blue
 

173
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,670
white i can use the red green blue
channels for

174
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
channels for
 

175
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,070
channels for
two different uh for three different um

176
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
two different uh for three different um
 

177
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,589
two different uh for three different um
light channels

178
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
light channels
 

179
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,390
light channels
so basically i can have this must be for

180
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
so basically i can have this must be for
 

181
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,390
so basically i can have this must be for
some super secret squirrel video stuff

182
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
some super secret squirrel video stuff
 

183
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,710
some super secret squirrel video stuff
because i'm not quite sure that i

184
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
because i'm not quite sure that i
 

185
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,430
because i'm not quite sure that i
understand

186
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
understand
 

187
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,670
understand
what it's for oh okay so we have all

188
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
what it's for oh okay so we have all
 

189
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,470
what it's for oh okay so we have all
those uh

190
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
those uh
 

191
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,430
those uh
the fancy lights um like the led lights

192
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
the fancy lights um like the led lights
 

193
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,789
the fancy lights um like the led lights
in the studio which you can change the

194
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
in the studio which you can change the
 

195
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,990
in the studio which you can change the
color of right

196
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
color of right
 

197
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,710
color of right
oh no no no i'm thinking i'm thinking of

198
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
oh no no no i'm thinking i'm thinking of
 

199
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,309
oh no no no i'm thinking i'm thinking of
the highlights the

200
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
the highlights the
 

201
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,390
the highlights the
shining not the upline no i'm talking

202
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
shining not the upline no i'm talking
 

203
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,830
shining not the upline no i'm talking
about i'm talking about the ones that

204
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
about i'm talking about the ones that
 

205
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,550
about i'm talking about the ones that
illuminate

206
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
illuminate
 

207
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,229
illuminate
them got it okay so this is to

208
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
them got it okay so this is to
 

209
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,149
them got it okay so this is to
to be able to control those from in here

210
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
to be able to control those from in here
 

211
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,070
to be able to control those from in here
so basically basically be able to turn

212
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
so basically basically be able to turn
 

213
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,750
so basically basically be able to turn
on and off the lights that are mounted

214
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
on and off the lights that are mounted
 

215
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,949
on and off the lights that are mounted
on the ceiling

216
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
on the ceiling
 

217
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,229
on the ceiling
without um without having to actually

218
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
without um without having to actually
 

219
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,910
without um without having to actually
like climb up and flip switches in the

220
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
like climb up and flip switches in the
 

221
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,590
like climb up and flip switches in the
ceiling to turn them on and off

222
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
ceiling to turn them on and off
 

223
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,189
ceiling to turn them on and off
but i would have thought you'd just need

224
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
but i would have thought you'd just need
 

225
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,670
but i would have thought you'd just need
one one connector for each light

226
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
one one connector for each light
 

227
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,070
one one connector for each light
is that not how it's supposed to well

228
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
is that not how it's supposed to well
 

229
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,870
is that not how it's supposed to well
then i'd have to

230
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
then i'd have to
 

231
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,430
then i'd have to
if i did each light then it would be uh

232
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
if i did each light then it would be uh
 

233
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,350
if i did each light then it would be uh
it would be 15 volts times

234
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
it would be 15 volts times
 

235
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,950
it would be 15 volts times
six so i'd have 15 15 volt

236
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
six so i'd have 15 15 volt
 

237
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,030
six so i'd have 15 15 volt
uh bricks up in the ceiling so what i'm

238
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
uh bricks up in the ceiling so what i'm
 

239
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,550
uh bricks up in the ceiling so what i'm
doing instead is i'm i'm

240
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
doing instead is i'm i'm
 

241
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,749
doing instead is i'm i'm
putting all of the lights through this

242
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
putting all of the lights through this
 

243
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,870
putting all of the lights through this
in a in a parallel circuit and

244
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
in a in a parallel circuit and
 

245
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,990
in a in a parallel circuit and
each of the lights are going to be

246
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
each of the lights are going to be
 

247
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,390
each of the lights are going to be
powered from this unit but this unit

248
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
powered from this unit but this unit
 

249
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,510
powered from this unit but this unit
receives

250
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
receives
 

251
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,790
receives
the signal from the console here

252
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
the signal from the console here
 

253
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,629
the signal from the console here
so that if i want to turn on the lights

254
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
so that if i want to turn on the lights
 

255
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,070
so that if i want to turn on the lights
in the studio all i have to do is just

256
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
in the studio all i have to do is just
 

257
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,310
in the studio all i have to do is just
flip the light switch here

258
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
flip the light switch here
 

259
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,150
flip the light switch here
it's more than a signal though right

260
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
it's more than a signal though right
 

261
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,710
it's more than a signal though right
because

262
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720

 

263
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,629

think of it as a really fancy light

264
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
think of it as a really fancy light
 

265
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,070
think of it as a really fancy light
switch i get it i

266
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
switch i get it i
 

267
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,070
switch i get it i
i get that part but are you still using

268
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
i get that part but are you still using
 

269
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,310
i get that part but are you still using
the 15 volt bricks that come with this

270
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
the 15 volt bricks that come with this
 

271
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,950
the 15 volt bricks that come with this
no no i'm gonna be creating my own power

272
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
no no i'm gonna be creating my own power
 

273
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,790
no no i'm gonna be creating my own power
circuit because i need three amps per

274
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
circuit because i need three amps per
 

275
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,629
circuit because i need three amps per
light

276
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
light
 

277
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,270
light
so which that thing provides no this is

278
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
so which that thing provides no this is
 

279
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,310
so which that thing provides no this is
just a receiver

280
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
just a receiver
 

281
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,510
just a receiver
this provides nothing it input and

282
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
this provides nothing it input and
 

283
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,710
this provides nothing it input and
output right if you have that input

284
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
output right if you have that input
 

285
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,909
output right if you have that input
right there so that's switching 15 volts

286
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
right there so that's switching 15 volts
 

287
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,749
right there so that's switching 15 volts
then

288
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
then
 

289
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,150
then
i'll be sending it 15 volts but maybe

290
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
i'll be sending it 15 volts but maybe
 

291
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,550
i'll be sending it 15 volts but maybe
like 10 amps

292
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
like 10 amps
 

293
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,909
like 10 amps
that's a 1900 that's 15

294
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
that's a 1900 that's 15
 

295
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,029
that's a 1900 that's 15
watts i don't know

296
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
watts i don't know
 

297
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,550
watts i don't know
i gotta work out the math but you know

298
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
i gotta work out the math but you know
 

299
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,469
i gotta work out the math but you know
what i mean yeah

300
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
what i mean yeah
 

301
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,070
what i mean yeah
anyway so that's that's kind of

302
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
anyway so that's that's kind of
 

303
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,670
anyway so that's that's kind of
interesting i mean it sounds great i'm

304
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
interesting i mean it sounds great i'm
 

305
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,990
interesting i mean it sounds great i'm
still

306
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
still
 

307
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,310
still
not sure i think i've figured out that

308
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
not sure i think i've figured out that
 

309
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,550
not sure i think i've figured out that
what you're trying to do is just

310
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
what you're trying to do is just
 

311
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,670
what you're trying to do is just
um enabling the switching of it from

312
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
um enabling the switching of it from
 

313
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,309
um enabling the switching of it from
your brain right yeah oh and you were

314
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
your brain right yeah oh and you were
 

315
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,909
your brain right yeah oh and you were
asking about a relay so i'll take one of

316
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
asking about a relay so i'll take one of
 

317
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,670
asking about a relay so i'll take one of
those channels and put it to a

318
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
those channels and put it to a
 

319
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,870
those channels and put it to a
12 uh like a 12 volt um

320
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
12 uh like a 12 volt um
 

321
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,990
12 uh like a 12 volt um
by 120 volt relay right

322
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
by 120 volt relay right
 

323
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
by 120 volt relay right
and then that then i'll be able to trip

324
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
and then that then i'll be able to trip
 

325
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,430
and then that then i'll be able to trip
the 110 volt

326
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
the 110 volt
 

327
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,189
the 110 volt
lamps as well okay okay so those will be

328
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
lamps as well okay okay so those will be
 

329
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,990
lamps as well okay okay so those will be
on a relay

330
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
on a relay
 

331
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,150
on a relay
yeah okay i'll figure it out

332
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
yeah okay i'll figure it out
 

333
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,189
yeah okay i'll figure it out
yeah okay it's complicated but not

334
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
yeah okay it's complicated but not
 

335
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,070
yeah okay it's complicated but not
complicated

336
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080

 

337
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,550

this is just it's just a receiver

338
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560

 

339
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,350

so it sends a signal a voltage so when i

340
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
so it sends a signal a voltage so when i
 

341
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,189
so it sends a signal a voltage so when i
flip a switch here it'll either trigger

342
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
flip a switch here it'll either trigger
 

343
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,950
flip a switch here it'll either trigger
turn on or off the voltage here

344
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960

 

345
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,070

yeah how fun hey yeah

346
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
yeah how fun hey yeah
 

347
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,550
yeah how fun hey yeah
it does look like fun you're actually

348
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
it does look like fun you're actually
 

349
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,830
it does look like fun you're actually
getting into electronics without

350
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
getting into electronics without
 

351
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,589
getting into electronics without
soldering

352
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
soldering
 

353
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,749
soldering
yeah well there will be some soldering

354
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
yeah well there will be some soldering
 

355
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,830
yeah well there will be some soldering
um but mostly just to

356
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
um but mostly just to
 

357
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,830
um but mostly just to
um to connect although i did get t

358
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
um to connect although i did get t
 

359
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,950
um to connect although i did get t
connectors for the

360
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
connectors for the
 

361
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,510
connectors for the
for the wiring so so i won't be

362
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
for the wiring so so i won't be
 

363
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,309
for the wiring so so i won't be
soldering that

364
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
soldering that
 

365
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,550
soldering that
but uh it should should work pretty nice

366
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
but uh it should should work pretty nice
 

367
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,070
but uh it should should work pretty nice
so i'm going to put one single circuit

368
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
so i'm going to put one single circuit
 

369
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,790
so i'm going to put one single circuit
to

370
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
to
 

371
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,830
to
a 15 volt light and then along that

372
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
a 15 volt light and then along that
 

373
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,029
a 15 volt light and then along that
along that circuit i'm going to be

374
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
along that circuit i'm going to be
 

375
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,870
along that circuit i'm going to be
branching out some parallel circuits

376
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
branching out some parallel circuits
 

377
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,830
branching out some parallel circuits
from that using t

378
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
from that using t
 

379
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,950
from that using t
connectors so i think that should work

380
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
connectors so i think that should work
 

381
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,870
connectors so i think that should work
peter does it sound like it'll work am i

382
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
peter does it sound like it'll work am i
 

383
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,309
peter does it sound like it'll work am i
going to blow up everything

384
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
going to blow up everything
 

385
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,510
going to blow up everything
yeah yeah i'm good okay

386
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
yeah yeah i'm good okay
 

387
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,110
yeah yeah i'm good okay
yeah yeah no one ever yet nine amps okay

388
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
yeah yeah no one ever yet nine amps okay
 

389
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,830
yeah yeah no one ever yet nine amps okay
so i gotta find a 15 volt nine amp or

390
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
so i gotta find a 15 volt nine amp or
 

391
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,270
so i gotta find a 15 volt nine amp or
probably what i'll end up doing is

392
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
probably what i'll end up doing is
 

393
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,790
probably what i'll end up doing is
getting like a 19 volt

394
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
getting like a 19 volt
 

395
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,270
getting like a 19 volt
power supply from a laptop or something

396
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
power supply from a laptop or something
 

397
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,070
power supply from a laptop or something
and

398
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
and
 

399
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,870
and
uh down downstepping it to 15 volts most

400
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
uh down downstepping it to 15 volts most
 

401
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,469
uh down downstepping it to 15 volts most
likely so i get the amperage but

402
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
likely so i get the amperage but
 

403
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,510
likely so i get the amperage but
most likely eh yeah yeah all right

404
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
most likely eh yeah yeah all right
 

405
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,430
most likely eh yeah yeah all right
peter's like i just i would just build

406
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
peter's like i just i would just build
 

407
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,430
peter's like i just i would just build
my own power supply out of spare parts

408
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
my own power supply out of spare parts
 

409
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,230
my own power supply out of spare parts
yeah and put it in oh exactly

410
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
yeah and put it in oh exactly
 

411
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,510
yeah and put it in oh exactly
i'm not i'm not doing that but yeah

412
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
i'm not i'm not doing that but yeah
 

413
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,029
i'm not i'm not doing that but yeah
should be a fun project so

414
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
should be a fun project so
 

415
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,350
should be a fun project so
reid what are you up to reid is joining

416
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
reid what are you up to reid is joining
 

417

you've been here a few times before but

420
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
you've been here a few times before but
 

421
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,950
you've been here a few times before but
it's been uh a problem trying to get

you're here with us today well finally i
 

431
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,589
you're here with us today well finally i
had to use a different laptop

432
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
had to use a different laptop
 

433
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,390
had to use a different laptop
uh windows has been doing its job every

434
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
uh windows has been doing its job every
 

435
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,589
uh windows has been doing its job every
time it updates

436
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
time it updates
 

437
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,909
time it updates
yeah not surprised

438
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919

 

439
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,110

doing that i had to switch to

440
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
doing that i had to switch to
 

441
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,430
doing that i had to switch to
i had to to boot up windows on my

442
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
i had to to boot up windows on my
 

443
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,790
i had to to boot up windows on my
desktop machine

444
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
desktop machine
 

445
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,509
desktop machine
earlier this week for a small project i

446
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
earlier this week for a small project i
 

447
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,870
earlier this week for a small project i
was doing

448
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
was doing
 

449
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,469
was doing
and it just made me feel dirty i

450
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
and it just made me feel dirty i
 

451
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,310
and it just made me feel dirty i
switched it right back to linux i wasn't

452
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
switched it right back to linux i wasn't
 

453
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,690
switched it right back to linux i wasn't
happy

454
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,700
happy
 

455
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,030
happy
[Laughter]

456
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
[Laughter]
 

457
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,630
[Laughter]
so is this windows that you're on read

458
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
so is this windows that you're on read
 

459
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,110
so is this windows that you're on read
that's working or is it yeah it is

460
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
that's working or is it yeah it is
 

461
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,870
that's working or is it yeah it is
windows it's working you're on windows

462
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
windows it's working you're on windows
 

463
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,470
windows it's working you're on windows
10 my

464
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
10 my
 

465
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,470
10 my
i don't just don't like it but i need it

466
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
i don't just don't like it but i need it
 

467
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,710
i don't just don't like it but i need it
for when i go out on the road

468
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
for when i go out on the road
 

469
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,990
for when i go out on the road
right yeah my media server is

470
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
right yeah my media server is
 

471
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,269
right yeah my media server is
is unrate and i've got a uh hardware

472
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
is unrate and i've got a uh hardware
 

473
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,910
is unrate and i've got a uh hardware
pass-through

474
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
pass-through
 

475
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,150
pass-through
on it and then switched over to linux

476
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
on it and then switched over to linux
 

477
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,030
on it and then switched over to linux
now

478
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
now
 

479
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,150
now
it's working quite nicely

480
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
it's working quite nicely
 

481
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,630
it's working quite nicely
excellent yeah i have an unraid server

482
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
excellent yeah i have an unraid server
 

483
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,150
excellent yeah i have an unraid server
at home as well

484
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
at home as well
 

485
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,150
at home as well
and i've really really liked it but the

486
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
and i've really really liked it but the
 

487
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,070
and i've really really liked it but the
problem that i've run into reed

488
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
problem that i've run into reed
 

489
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,750
problem that i've run into reed
is that the hardware is now

490
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
is that the hardware is now
 

491
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,430
is that the hardware is now
so it because it's it's just old

492
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
so it because it's it's just old
 

493
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,190
so it because it's it's just old
faithfully like unread just runs and

494
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
faithfully like unread just runs and
 

495
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,949
faithfully like unread just runs and
runs and runs

496
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
runs and runs
 

497
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,150
runs and runs
but um because it's been running for

498
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
but um because it's been running for
 

499
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,190
but um because it's been running for
how many years boy oh boy if we search

500
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
how many years boy oh boy if we search
 

501
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,269
how many years boy oh boy if we search
the category 5 site and looked at when i

502
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
the category 5 site and looked at when i
 

503
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,710
the category 5 site and looked at when i
first started talking about unraid you'd

504
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
first started talking about unraid you'd
 

505
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,389
first started talking about unraid you'd
know how long ago i built that

506
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
know how long ago i built that
 

507
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,829
know how long ago i built that
that would have been in like studio b so

508
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
that would have been in like studio b so
 

509
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,150
that would have been in like studio b so
um it's been running forever but now i'm

510
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
um it's been running forever but now i'm
 

511
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,070
um it's been running forever but now i'm
running into this case where it still

512
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
running into this case where it still
 

513
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,389
running into this case where it still
works it's still holding all my files

514
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
works it's still holding all my files
 

515
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,110
works it's still holding all my files
but um h.265 didn't exist back then

516
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
but um h.265 didn't exist back then
 

517
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,230
but um h.265 didn't exist back then
so the hardware is i don't have an h.265

518
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
so the hardware is i don't have an h.265
 

519
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,470
so the hardware is i don't have an h.265
decoder and the cpu is not powerful

520
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
decoder and the cpu is not powerful
 

521
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,190
decoder and the cpu is not powerful
enough

522
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
enough
 

523
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,269
enough
so my videos stutter if i'm trying to

524
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
so my videos stutter if i'm trying to
 

525
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,790
so my videos stutter if i'm trying to
watch h.265

526
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
watch h.265
 

527
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,230
watch h.265
so i have to either convert everything

528
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
so i have to either convert everything
 

529
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,230
so i have to either convert everything
to h.264

530
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
to h.264
 

531
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,430
to h.264
or load it locally on the computer so so

532
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
or load it locally on the computer so so
 

533
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,069
or load it locally on the computer so so
i'm looking at qnap

534
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
i'm looking at qnap
 

535
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,990
i'm looking at qnap
because qnap have some really

536
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
because qnap have some really
 

537
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,750
because qnap have some really
interesting

538
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
interesting
 

539
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,949
interesting
raid devices and nas units that have tv

540

549
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,670
synology as well yeah the thing i like
about okay so qnap versus synology

550
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
about okay so qnap versus synology
 

551
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,190
about okay so qnap versus synology
synology is like a closed box qnap

552
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
synology is like a closed box qnap
 

553
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,990
synology is like a closed box qnap
is like a linux computer with a really

554
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
is like a linux computer with a really
 

555
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,190
is like a linux computer with a really
cool back end

556
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
cool back end
 

557
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,550
cool back end
and really nice uh back plane so

558
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
and really nice uh back plane so
 

559
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,470
and really nice uh back plane so
cue the reason i'm more interested in

560
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
cue the reason i'm more interested in
 

561
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,310
cue the reason i'm more interested in
qnap versus synology is

562
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
qnap versus synology is
 

563
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,310
qnap versus synology is
synology is like you're locked to their

564

if i wanted to i could boot a debian
 

569
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,750
if i wanted to i could boot a debian
distro on it and run it myself without

00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
distro on it and run it myself without
 

571
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,110
distro on it and run it myself without
so the only question i have about qnab

572
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
so the only question i have about qnab
 

573
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,470
so the only question i have about qnab
since i think i'm not sure

574
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
since i think i'm not sure
 

575
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,150
since i think i'm not sure
but um synology has this awesome

576
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
but um synology has this awesome
 

577
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,110

app called moments that what it will do

578
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
app called moments that what it will do
 

579
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,069
app called moments that what it will do
is if you just

580
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
is if you just
 

581
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,069
is if you just
load your pictures into a pictures

582
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
load your pictures into a pictures

folder you know whatever pictures you
 

585
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,069
folder you know whatever pictures you
you get from your camera and it will

you get from your camera and it will
 

587
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,990
you get from your camera and it will
just sync up to the

588
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
just sync up to the
 

589
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,590
just sync up to the
um to moments it will categorize it will

590
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
um to moments it will categorize it will
 

591
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,829
um to moments it will categorize it will
find

592
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
find
 

593
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,470
find
faces in every single photo in your

594
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
faces in every single photo in your
 

595
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,069
faces in every single photo in your
library

596
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
library
 

597
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,110
library
and it will figure out who they are

598
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
and it will figure out who they are
 

599
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,389
and it will figure out who they are
or at least it will figure out that

600
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
or at least it will figure out that
 

601
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,949
or at least it will figure out that
they're the same person and ask you who

602
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
they're the same person and ask you who
 

603
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,829
they're the same person and ask you who
is this

604
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
is this
 

605
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,870
is this
and if you say this person is

606
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
and if you say this person is
 

607
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,790
and if you say this person is
this person once it will go and

608
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
this person once it will go and
 

609
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,790
this person once it will go and
categorize everywhere that that person

610
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
categorize everywhere that that person
 

611
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,910
categorize everywhere that that person
appears

612
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
appears
 

613
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,470
appears
and link that photo in that's the

614
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
and link that photo in that's the
 

615
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,269
and link that photo in that's the
primary reason i went with synology

616
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
primary reason i went with synology
 

617
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,310
primary reason i went with synology
i could not find that same app

618
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
i could not find that same app
 

619
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,629
i could not find that same app
in in qnap otherwise i would have done

620
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
in in qnap otherwise i would have done
 

621
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,990
in in qnap otherwise i would have done
qnap as well

622
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
qnap as well
 

623
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,030
qnap as well
but ai is just just one of that stuff

624
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
but ai is just just one of that stuff
 

625
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,430
but ai is just just one of that stuff
yeah and it's done locally if they don't

626
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
yeah and it's done locally if they don't
 

627
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,310
yeah and it's done locally if they don't
send wow

628
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
send wow
 

629
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,910
send wow
they don't send the pictures off to the

630
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
they don't send the pictures off to the
 

631
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,389
they don't send the pictures off to the
internet to get to categorize them

632
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
internet to get to categorize them
 

633
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,910
internet to get to categorize them
it's done locally and that means it

634
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
it's done locally and that means it
 

635
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,590
it's done locally and that means it
takes a while to run

636
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
takes a while to run
 

637
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,470
takes a while to run

like
 

657
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,990
like
a uh the math units oh i thought you

658
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
a uh the math units oh i thought you
 

659
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,990
a uh the math units oh i thought you
were talking about

660
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,000
were talking about
 

661
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,069
were talking about
c-o-b-o-l programming language

662
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
c-o-b-o-l programming language
 

663
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,590
c-o-b-o-l programming language
oh cobalt helio 64

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
oh cobalt helio 64
 

665
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,190
oh cobalt helio 64
is um an open source

666
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
is um an open source
 

667
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,870
is um an open source
um sbc kind of soc powered

nas unit and they've been they

670
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
nas unit and they've been they
 

671
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,870
nas unit and they've been they
introduced this thing

672
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
introduced this thing
 

673
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,269
introduced this thing
several months ago but then the pandemic

674
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
several months ago but then the pandemic
 

675
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,190
several months ago but then the pandemic
hit and it affected manufacturing and

676
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
hit and it affected manufacturing and
 

677
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,110
hit and it affected manufacturing and
distribution and qc

678
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
distribution and qc
 

679
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,190
distribution and qc
and uh so you know things are behind

680
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
and uh so you know things are behind
 

681
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,430
and uh so you know things are behind
schedule but they just sent out an email

682
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
schedule but they just sent out an email
 

683
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,790
schedule but they just sent out an email
today i think

684
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
today i think
 

685
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,550
today i think
uh might have been last night but today

686
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
uh might have been last night but today
 

687
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,069
uh might have been last night but today
i received it anyways

688
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
i received it anyways
 

689
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,470
i received it anyways
um saying that they're getting back on

690
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
um saying that they're getting back on
 

691
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,829
um saying that they're getting back on
track and they're starting to ship so

692
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
track and they're starting to ship so
 

693
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,470
track and they're starting to ship so
these are like

694
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
these are like
 

695
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,430
these are like
open source math units read it would be

696
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
open source math units read it would be
 

697
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,389
open source math units read it would be
amazing

698
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
amazing
 

699
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,110
amazing
for unraid because this is like a

700
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
for unraid because this is like a
 

701
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,230
for unraid because this is like a
self-contained now

702
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240

 

703
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,870

okay this is a self-contained mass unit

704
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
okay this is a self-contained mass unit
 

705
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,509
okay this is a self-contained mass unit
that looks like a qnap or a synology or

706
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
that looks like a qnap or a synology or
 

707
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,470
that looks like a qnap or a synology or
something like that

708
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
something like that
 

709
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,069
something like that
but it's entirely open source and you

710
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
but it's entirely open source and you
 

711
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,829
but it's entirely open source and you
can just install linux on it so

712
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
can just install linux on it so
 

713
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,310
can just install linux on it so
i would imagine if it runs linux it's

714
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
i would imagine if it runs linux it's
 

715
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,629
i would imagine if it runs linux it's
going to be able to run slack

716
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
going to be able to run slack
 

717
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,110
going to be able to run slack
if it can run slack it can run unraid so

718
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
if it can run slack it can run unraid so
 

719
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,710
if it can run slack it can run unraid so
it would be a nice little unit for that

720
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
it would be a nice little unit for that
 

721
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,710
it would be a nice little unit for that
see how i circled back and got right

722
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
see how i circled back and got right
 

723
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,750
see how i circled back and got right
back to your conversation

724
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
back to your conversation
 

725
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,790
back to your conversation
well unraid's pretty easy to swap from

726
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
well unraid's pretty easy to swap from
 

727
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,189
well unraid's pretty easy to swap from
uh

728
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
uh
 

729
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,829
uh
you know cpu or something like that you

730
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
you know cpu or something like that you
 

731
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,550
you know cpu or something like that you
just

732
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
just
 

733
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,670
just
yeah i've upgraded my server completely

734
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
yeah i've upgraded my server completely
 

735
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,590
yeah i've upgraded my server completely
like put it in new motherboard new

736
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
like put it in new motherboard new
 

737
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,150
like put it in new motherboard new
server everything

738
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160

 

739
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,350

are you doing anything with the vms no

740
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
are you doing anything with the vms no
 

741
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,710
are you doing anything with the vms no
because my

742
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
because my
 

743
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,430
because my
my hardware was i just i put it in old

744
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
my hardware was i just i put it in old
 

745
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,389
my hardware was i just i put it in old
hardware

746
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
hardware
 

747
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,470
hardware
that was part of my purpose with unraid

748
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
that was part of my purpose with unraid
 

749
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,629
that was part of my purpose with unraid
was to repurpose old stuff

750
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
was to repurpose old stuff
 

751
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,110
was to repurpose old stuff
that's what i'm now i'm feeling the

752
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
that's what i'm now i'm feeling the
 

753
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,550
that's what i'm now i'm feeling the
effects of that because it's not

754
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
effects of that because it's not
 

755
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,670
effects of that because it's not
powerful enough

756
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
powerful enough
 

757
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,750
powerful enough
because the unraid has evolved to be

758
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
because the unraid has evolved to be
 

759
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,590
because the unraid has evolved to be
able to support vms and docker and

760
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
able to support vms and docker and
 

761
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,629
able to support vms and docker and
things like that

762
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
things like that
 

763
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,670
things like that
so i do run plugins because i've got

764
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
so i do run plugins because i've got
 

765
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,750
so i do run plugins because i've got
like plex media server on there but i'm

766
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
like plex media server on there but i'm
 

767
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,750
like plex media server on there but i'm
using the old plug-in architecture

768
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
using the old plug-in architecture
 

769
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,150
using the old plug-in architecture
because the virtualization platform is

770
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
because the virtualization platform is
 

771
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,430
because the virtualization platform is
just too too much for

772
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
just too too much for
 

773
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,030
just too too much for
my server so although i might

774
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
my server so although i might
 

775
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,189
my server so although i might
can like i could even install i'll bet

776
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
can like i could even install i'll bet
 

777
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,430
can like i could even install i'll bet
you you can install unraid on a qnap

778
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440

 

779
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,710

don't know because they are they're

780
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
don't know because they are they're
 

781
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,949
don't know because they are they're
linux machines they're just like a

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,629
linux machines they're just like a
the one that i'm looking at is a pbs

784
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
the one that i'm looking at is a pbs
 

785
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,069
the one that i'm looking at is a pbs
something and it's uh

786
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
something and it's uh
 

787
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,790
something and it's uh
it's an i3 so at its heart it's just an

00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
pc but it you know how qnap has made it
 

793
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,790
pc but it you know how qnap has made it
into a really nice looking

794
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
into a really nice looking
 

795
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,069
into a really nice looking

so the idea is that you plug it directly

812
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
so the idea is that you plug it directly
 

813
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,910
so the idea is that you plug it directly
into your tv

814
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
into your tv
 

815
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,509
into your tv
if you want to uh if you want to watch

816
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
if you want to uh if you want to watch
 

817
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,749
if you want to uh if you want to watch
although having that h.165 decoding

818
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
although having that h.165 decoding
 

819
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,189
although having that h.165 decoding
capability means that

820
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
capability means that
 

821
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,269
capability means that
even if you like with you with unraid

822
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
even if you like with you with unraid
 

823
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,350
even if you like with you with unraid
with

any of your devices and the the device
 

827
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,430
any of your devices and the the device
would be able to handle the h.265

828
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
would be able to handle the h.265
 

829
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,430
would be able to handle the h.265
okay okay with the uh the uh

830
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
okay okay with the uh the uh
 

831
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,870
okay okay with the uh the uh
ability to take and uh

832
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
ability to take and uh
 

833
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,790
ability to take and uh
pass hardware and whatnot you if you

834
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
pass hardware and whatnot you if you
 

835
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,550
pass hardware and whatnot you if you
have an extra video card you can use

836
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
have an extra video card you can use
 

837
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,430
have an extra video card you can use
that to do the

838
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
that to do the
 

839
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,590
that to do the
decoding hmm

840
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
decoding hmm
 

841
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,829
decoding hmm
that's an interest oh you know what yes

842
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
that's an interest oh you know what yes
 

843
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,110
that's an interest oh you know what yes
that's an interesting point

844
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
that's an interesting point
 

845
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,150
that's an interesting point
however in my old server

846
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
however in my old server
 

847
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,069
however in my old server
guess what's taking up all the pcie

848
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
guess what's taking up all the pcie
 

849
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,470
guess what's taking up all the pcie
lanes yeah of course

850
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
lanes yeah of course
 

851
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,829

so yeah i gotta i gotta do something

854
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
so yeah i gotta i gotta do something
 

855
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,430
so yeah i gotta i gotta do something
with that that bad boy

856
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
with that that bad boy
 

857
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,350
with that that bad boy
i imported a couple of a couple more

858
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
i imported a couple of a couple more
 

859
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,470
i imported a couple of a couple more
episodes of one of the shows we're

860
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
episodes of one of the shows we're
 

861
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,910
episodes of one of the shows we're
watching last night

watching last night
 

863
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,829
watching last night
and you hear it's a dual cpu

864
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
and you hear it's a dual cpu
 

865
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,350
and you hear it's a dual cpu
uh uh xeon

866
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
uh uh xeon
 

867
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,629
uh uh xeon
3.0 gigahertz like old gen so when

868
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
3.0 gigahertz like old gen so when
 

869
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,710
3.0 gigahertz like old gen so when
when you load files into it and plex

870
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
when you load files into it and plex
 

871
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,189
when you load files into it and plex
starts transcoding those on the cpu

872
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199

 

873
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,389

you're trying to watch your show and

874
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
you're trying to watch your show and
 

875
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,230
you're trying to watch your show and
it's like oh you imported videos again

876
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
it's like oh you imported videos again
 

877
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,269
it's like oh you imported videos again
didn't you

878
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
didn't you
 

879
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,430
didn't you
as soon as plex starts transcoding it

880
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
as soon as plex starts transcoding it
 

881
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,470
as soon as plex starts transcoding it
just it takes off

882
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480

 

883
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,069

so what's your hardware look like reed

884
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
so what's your hardware look like reed
 

885
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,230
so what's your hardware look like reed
like you're running it on an old pc as

886
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
like you're running it on an old pc as
 

887
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,829
like you're running it on an old pc as
well or you've got a little bit more of

888
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
well or you've got a little bit more of
 

889
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,069
well or you've got a little bit more of
a

890

to
get crazy with it i'm passing uh the

898
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
get crazy with it i'm passing uh the
 

899
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,510
get crazy with it i'm passing uh the
video card

900
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
video card
 

901
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,350
video card
so my unrate is also my media center

902
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
so my unrate is also my media center
 

903
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,990
so my unrate is also my media center
perfect yeah uh what are you using for

904
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
perfect yeah uh what are you using for
 

905
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,429
perfect yeah uh what are you using for
the media center are you using like

906
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
the media center are you using like
 

907
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,150
the media center are you using like
something like i

908
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
something like i
 

909
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,710
something like i
am with plex or yeah well i'm using plex

910
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
am with plex or yeah well i'm using plex
 

911
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,350
am with plex or yeah well i'm using plex
is my

912
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
is my
 

913
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,750
is my
you know my backbone but uh yeah okay

you know my backbone but uh yeah okay
running uh

916
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
running uh
 

917
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,710
running uh
i was running windows i was running

918
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
i was running windows i was running
 

919
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,230
i was running windows i was running
windows media center

920

windows media center
 

921
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,990
windows media center
but i've uh i've been playing around

922
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
but i've uh i've been playing around
 

923
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,430
but i've uh i've been playing around
with a couple of different linux

924
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
with a couple of different linux
 

925
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,630
with a couple of different linux
distributions

926
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640

 

927
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,510

they all seem to work pretty well it's

928
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
they all seem to work pretty well it's
 

929
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,110
they all seem to work pretty well it's
the one thing i got right now

930
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
the one thing i got right now
 

931
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,750
the one thing i got right now
uh because there's been some changes and

932
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
uh because there's been some changes and
 

933
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,750
uh because there's been some changes and
i moved some hardware around

934
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
i moved some hardware around
 

935
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,950
i moved some hardware around
if i uh if i shut down the vm

936
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
if i uh if i shut down the vm
 

937
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,029
if i uh if i shut down the vm
a lot of times i got a reboot to get the

938
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
a lot of times i got a reboot to get the
 

939
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,190
a lot of times i got a reboot to get the
the the hardware back i didn't have that

940
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
the the hardware back i didn't have that
 

941
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,950
the the hardware back i didn't have that
happening before but i moved some stuff

942
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
happening before but i moved some stuff
 

943
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,830
happening before but i moved some stuff
around and

944
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
around and
 

945
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,430
around and
i got to look into that a little bit

946
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
i got to look into that a little bit
 

947
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,070
i got to look into that a little bit
more are you talking like your config

oh okay see where i've done things
 

967
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,470
oh okay see where i've done things
differently is i'm using the mount

968
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
differently is i'm using the mount
 

969
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,029
differently is i'm using the mount
points

975
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,549
so that way i take advantage of all the
redundancy that unraid gives me because

976
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
redundancy that unraid gives me because
 

977
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,630
redundancy that unraid gives me because
if i drop any files

978
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
if i drop any files
 

979
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,870
if i drop any files
um to that it's going to span across the

980
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
um to that it's going to span across the
 

981
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,029
um to that it's going to span across the
array well everything works the only

982
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
array well everything works the only
 

983
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,710
array well everything works the only
problem is it like i say if

984
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
problem is it like i say if
 

985
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,830
problem is it like i say if
if i reboot the vm you know

986
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
if i reboot the vm you know
 

987
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,830
if i reboot the vm you know
whatever it is especially with linux i

988
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
whatever it is especially with linux i
 

989
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,830
whatever it is especially with linux i
didn't have the problem with windows

990
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
didn't have the problem with windows
 

991
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,190
didn't have the problem with windows
but uh you you get a blank screen

992
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
but uh you you get a blank screen
 

993
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,830
but uh you you get a blank screen
everything else works uh you've got the

994
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
everything else works uh you've got the
 

995
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,669
everything else works uh you've got the
presence on the net and everything but

996
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
presence on the net and everything but
 

997
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,549
presence on the net and everything but
uh

998
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
uh
 

999
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,630
uh
you just don't have the video showing up

1000
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
you just don't have the video showing up
 

1001
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,909
you just don't have the video showing up
the only way of getting it back

1002
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
the only way of getting it back
 

1003
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,590
the only way of getting it back
is to uh reboot the whole unit oh i see

1004
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
is to uh reboot the whole unit oh i see
 

1005
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,230
is to uh reboot the whole unit oh i see
okay interesting yeah my on rate server

1006
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
okay interesting yeah my on rate server
 

1007
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,830
okay interesting yeah my on rate server
runs completely headless

1008
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:07,840
runs completely headless
 

1009
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,710
runs completely headless
so everything is done through either the

1010
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
so everything is done through either the
 

1011
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,830
so everything is done through either the
web browser like

1012
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
web browser like
 

1013
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,950
web browser like
plex is at port 32400

1014
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
plex is at port 32400
 

1015
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,789
plex is at port 32400
so you just access it through your web

1016
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
so you just access it through your web
 

1017
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,549
so you just access it through your web
browser and i do that from any of my

1018
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
browser and i do that from any of my
 

1019
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,510
browser and i do that from any of my
devices

1020
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
devices
 

1021
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,350
devices
or i have the plex app on my phone and

1022
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
or i have the plex app on my phone and
 

1023
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,430
or i have the plex app on my phone and
tablets and things like that

1024
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
tablets and things like that
 

1025
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,430
tablets and things like that
that's what i do other than the fast

1026
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
that's what i do other than the fast
 

1027
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,110
that's what i do other than the fast
group of the media center the media

1028
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
group of the media center the media
 

1029
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,430
group of the media center the media
center is just like another computer

1030
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
center is just like another computer
 

1031
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,430
center is just like another computer
right yeah so i use samba shares for

1032
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
right yeah so i use samba shares for
 

1033
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,470
right yeah so i use samba shares for
that

1034
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
that
 

1035
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,190
that
so accessing them through samba i just

1036
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
so accessing them through samba i just
 

1037
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,310
so accessing them through samba i just
run clicks

1038
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
run clicks
 

1039
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,190
run clicks
on my roku box and it just it just

1040
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
on my roku box and it just it just
 

1041
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,230
on my roku box and it just it just
connects to the

1042
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
connects to the
 

1043
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,070
connects to the
to the now you're using you're using it

1044
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
to the now you're using you're using it
 

1045
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,750
to the now you're using you're using it
as a client versus a

1046
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
as a client versus a
 

1047
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,270
as a client versus a
server then it's kind of like two ways

1048
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
server then it's kind of like two ways
 

1049
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,710
server then it's kind of like two ways
to use plex the roku is the client

1050
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
to use plex the roku is the client
 

1051
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,549
to use plex the roku is the client
which is which is what's plugged up to

1052
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
which is which is what's plugged up to
 

1053
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,750
which is which is what's plugged up to
the tv i have

1054
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
the tv i have
 

1055
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,029
the tv i have
two or three rokus and the server

1056
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
two or three rokus and the server
 

1057
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,390
two or three rokus and the server
is the uh synology box right so click

1058
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
is the uh synology box right so click
 

1059
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,470
is the uh synology box right so click
servers running on that and of course

1060
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
servers running on that and of course
 

1061
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,990
servers running on that and of course
that's where all the that's where all

1062
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
that's where all the that's where all
 

1063
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,110
that's where all the that's where all
the

1064
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
the
 

1065
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,909
the
you know the videos are stored there as

1066
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
you know the videos are stored there as
 

1067
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,390
you know the videos are stored there as
well

1068
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
well
 

1069
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,909
well
and the transcoding would be taking

1070
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
and the transcoding would be taking
 

1071
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,750
and the transcoding would be taking
place on the synology

1072
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
place on the synology
 

1073
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,149
place on the synology
so you're absolutely sure it doesn't it

1074
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
so you're absolutely sure it doesn't it
 

1075
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,230
so you're absolutely sure it doesn't it
doesn't spin up like my bad boy

1076
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
doesn't spin up like my bad boy
 

1077
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,590
doesn't spin up like my bad boy
so does the synology have you have you

1078
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
so does the synology have you have you
 

1079
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,430
so does the synology have you have you
like done any experimenting with various

1080
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
like done any experimenting with various
 

1081
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,830
like done any experimenting with various
like hebc formats and

1082
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
like hebc formats and
 

1083
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,830
like hebc formats and
to be able to know if it's able to play

1084
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:25,840
to be able to know if it's able to play
 

1085
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,230
to be able to know if it's able to play
them i haven't really really

1086
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
them i haven't really really
 

1087
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,830
them i haven't really really
that much attention to that um i have

1088
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
that much attention to that um i have
 

1089
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,789
that much attention to that um i have
found that

1090
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
found that
 

1091
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,310
found that
um you know i can play in p4 videos

1092
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
um you know i can play in p4 videos
 

1093
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,590
um you know i can play in p4 videos
i can play now yeah i say that but i

1094
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
i can play now yeah i say that but i
 

1095
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,270
i can play now yeah i say that but i
don't know what the internal structure

1096
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
don't know what the internal structure
 

1097
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,149
don't know what the internal structure
of it is

1098
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
of it is
 

1099
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,950
of it is
yeah it takes 264 but i don't know that

1100
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
yeah it takes 264 but i don't know that
 

1101
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,990
yeah it takes 264 but i don't know that
for sure

1102
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
for sure
 

1103
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,310
for sure
and p4 is just a container right so

1104
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
and p4 is just a container right so
 

1105
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,029
and p4 is just a container right so
right

1106
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
right
 

1107
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,310
right
where where the difference is is h.264

1108
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
where where the difference is is h.264
 

1109
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,750
where where the difference is is h.264
is is very very lightweight on the cpu

1110
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:56,760
is is very very lightweight on the cpu
 

1111
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,230
is is very very lightweight on the cpu
h.265 sacrifices cpu

1112
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
h.265 sacrifices cpu
 

1113
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,390
h.265 sacrifices cpu
cycles for lower uh file size

1114
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
cycles for lower uh file size
 

1115
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,789
cycles for lower uh file size
okay so so you get a smaller file with

1116
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
okay so so you get a smaller file with
 

1117
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,830
okay so so you get a smaller file with
h.265

1118
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
h.265
 

1119
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,590
h.265
but it takes a lo decided whether i want

1120
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
but it takes a lo decided whether i want
 

1121
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,549
but it takes a lo decided whether i want
to sign up for the flip for the plex um

good idea to put the antenna in the
 

1331
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,149
good idea to put the antenna in the
attic because

1332

1337
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,950
you're not going to get the best
reception up in the attic there bp now

1338
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
reception up in the attic there bp now
 

1339
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,070
reception up in the attic there bp now
you're going to get to about

1340
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
you're going to get to about
 

1341
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,510
you're going to get to about
10 to 12 tb

1342
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520

 

1343
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,430

if you've got weeks it will make it

1344
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
if you've got weeks it will make it
 

1345
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,909
if you've got weeks it will make it
worse what uh what are you basing that

1346
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
worse what uh what are you basing that
 

1347
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,190
worse what uh what are you basing that
on i mean my

1348
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200
on i mean my
 

1349
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,870
on i mean my
my roof is um is a wooden

1350
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
my roof is um is a wooden
 

1351
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,230
my roof is um is a wooden
wooden um uh planks and then

1352
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
wooden um uh planks and then
 

1353
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,350
wooden um uh planks and then
um shingles uh tar

1354
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
um shingles uh tar
 

1355
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,230
um shingles uh tar
tar shingles so there's no metal in the

1356
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
tar shingles so there's no metal in the
 

1357
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,990
tar shingles so there's no metal in the
roof at all

1358
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
roof at all
 

1359
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,909
roof at all
but when it goes together by the actual

1360
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
but when it goes together by the actual
 

1361
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,310
but when it goes together by the actual
roof itself you need to put it outside

1362
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
roof itself you need to put it outside
 

1363
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,350
roof itself you need to put it outside
on a boat

1364
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,360
on a boat
 

1365
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,789
on a boat
and basically uh if you're allowed to do

1366
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
and basically uh if you're allowed to do
 

1367
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,070
and basically uh if you're allowed to do
that

1368
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
that
 

1369
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,710
that
yeah i think so yeah i don't think i'd

1370
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
yeah i think so yeah i don't think i'd
 

1371
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,990
yeah i think so yeah i don't think i'd
have any problem doing that

1372
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
have any problem doing that
 

1373
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,630
have any problem doing that
so yeah yeah yeah because uh you just

1374
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
so yeah yeah yeah because uh you just
 

1375
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,029
so yeah yeah yeah because uh you just
fighting it all the time

1376
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039

 

1377
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,990

even in in yeah in your house anywhere

1378
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
even in in yeah in your house anywhere
 

1379
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,549
even in in yeah in your house anywhere
it probably got a weak

1380
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559

 

1381
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,710

well as you know with um with hf

1382
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
well as you know with um with hf
 

1383
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,549
well as you know with um with hf
frequencies night time is usually

1384
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559
frequencies night time is usually
 

1385
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:23,350
frequencies night time is usually
better when you can hear stations

1386
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360

 

1387
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,029

yeah all i was all i was going to say

1388
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
yeah all i was all i was going to say
 

1389
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,269
yeah all i was all i was going to say

was that i do have better luck
 

1391
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,029
was that i do have better luck

um receiving uh free over-the-air
 

1393
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,110
um receiving uh free over-the-air
even on the internal antenna that i hang

1394
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
even on the internal antenna that i hang
 

1395
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,230
even on the internal antenna that i hang
up on the wall

1396

1401
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,750

um are radio waves affected by heat

1402
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
um are radio waves affected by heat
 

1403
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,510
um are radio waves affected by heat
no they're affected by the by the um

1404
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
no they're affected by the by the um
 

1405
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,269
no they're affected by the by the um
ionosphere whether the signal is

1406
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279
ionosphere whether the signal is
 

1407
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,230
ionosphere whether the signal is
bouncing off

1408
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240

 

1409
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,669

well that's true that'll go right

1410
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
well that's true that'll go right
 

1411
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,430
well that's true that'll go right
through but um

1412
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,440
through but um
 

1413
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,390
through but um
the i don't know i'd have to go check

1414
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
the i don't know i'd have to go check
 

1415
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,190
the i don't know i'd have to go check
the um

1416

the um
 

1417
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,269
the um
the frequencies of the tv channels that

1418
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
the frequencies of the tv channels that
 

1419
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,630
the frequencies of the tv channels that
i'm receiving because i'm not sure if

1420
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
i'm receiving because i'm not sure if
 

1421
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,590
i'm receiving because i'm not sure if
they're uh

1422
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
they're uh
 

1423
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,789
they're uh
i do make sure something no

1424
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
i do make sure something no
 

1425
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,350
i do make sure something no
okay yeah that'd be uh for sure

1426
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360

 

1427
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,430

away from you yeah i'm i'm trying to

1428
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
away from you yeah i'm i'm trying to
 

1429
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,789
away from you yeah i'm i'm trying to
come up with the answer for that i want

1430
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
come up with the answer for that i want
 

1431
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,510
come up with the answer for that i want
to say

1432
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
to say
 

1433
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,789
to say
20 miles in one direction and probably

1434
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
20 miles in one direction and probably
 

1435
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,430
20 miles in one direction and probably
30 miles in a different direction so at

1436
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
30 miles in a different direction so at
 

1437
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,510
30 miles in a different direction so at
a minimum i would need two antennas one

1438
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
a minimum i would need two antennas one
 

1439
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,549
a minimum i would need two antennas one
point this direction

1440
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:30,559

 

1441
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,830

up and down or they're flat uh it's up

1442
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840
up and down or they're flat uh it's up
 

1443
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,950
up and down or they're flat uh it's up
and down

1444
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
and down
 

1445
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,389
and down
you my problem oh i understand oh

1446
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:38,399
you my problem oh i understand oh
 

1447

00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
oh yeah i get it i get it i may not be
 

1449
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,190
oh yeah i get it i get it i may not be
able to get a a tower tall enough to

1450
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
able to get a a tower tall enough to
 

1451
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,029
able to get a a tower tall enough to
peek over the hill

1452
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039

 

1453
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,830

the where the uh uh transmitter is i

1454
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
the where the uh uh transmitter is i
 

1455
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,510
the where the uh uh transmitter is i
absolutely get that

1456
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
absolutely get that
 

1457
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,029
absolutely get that
i've i've used i've used software peter

1458
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
i've i've used i've used software peter
 

1459
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,190
i've i've used i've used software peter
for determining the footprint of a

1460
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
for determining the footprint of a
 

1461
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,070
for determining the footprint of a
repeater

1462
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
repeater
 

1463
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,870
repeater
a ham radio repeater to figure out where

1464
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
a ham radio repeater to figure out where
 

1465
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,710
a ham radio repeater to figure out where
it would be visible based on the

1466
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
it would be visible based on the
 

1467
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,990
it would be visible based on the
on the terrain so yeah i get that i get

1468
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
on the terrain so yeah i get that i get
 

1469
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,830
on the terrain so yeah i get that i get
that

1470
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840
that
 

1471
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,149
that
you would have to be even worse yeah

1472
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
you would have to be even worse yeah
 

1473
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,149
you would have to be even worse yeah
yeah that's true

1474
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
yeah that's true
 

1475
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,990
yeah that's true
and then you got to uh uh it's over

1476
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
and then you got to uh uh it's over
 

1477
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,190
and then you got to uh uh it's over
12 12 96 even better yeah

1478
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
12 12 96 even better yeah
 

1479
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,269
12 12 96 even better yeah
so you know that's that's why i'm not

1480
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
so you know that's that's why i'm not

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,190
up and they got tv
well peter will tell you peter will tell

1586
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200
well peter will tell you peter will tell
 

1587
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,470
well peter will tell you peter will tell
you this as well but

1588
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
you this as well but
 

1589
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,710
you this as well but
with uhf you only have to move a few

1590
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
with uhf you only have to move a few
 

1591
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,549
with uhf you only have to move a few
inches one direction or another

1592
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
inches one direction or another
 

1593
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,470
inches one direction or another
and you you that could be the difference

1594
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
and you you that could be the difference
 

1595
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,070
and you you that could be the difference
between no signal

1596
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
between no signal
 

1597
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,470
between no signal
and full strength and just because you

1598
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
and full strength and just because you
 

1599
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,789
and full strength and just because you
go higher doesn't mean it's better

1600
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
go higher doesn't mean it's better
 

1601
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,789
go higher doesn't mean it's better
sometimes you go up and you lose a

1602
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
sometimes you go up and you lose a
 

1603
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,630
sometimes you go up and you lose a
signal entirely sure

1604
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
signal entirely sure
 

1605
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,590
signal entirely sure
yep yep yep i know that there's a chance

1606
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600
yep yep yep i know that there's a chance
 

1607
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,789
yep yep yep i know that there's a chance
that i can get

1608
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:34,799
that i can get
 

1609
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,510
that i can get
i can get at least one station from from

1610
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
i can get at least one station from from
 

1611
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,029
i can get at least one station from from
that one direction

1612
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
that one direction
 

1613
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,590
that one direction
um just because there's nothing in the

1614
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
um just because there's nothing in the
 

1615
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,070
um just because there's nothing in the
