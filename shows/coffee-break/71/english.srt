817
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,110
going to a tt shell that you can do
during installation and then he started

818
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
during installation and then he started
 

819
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,030
during installation and then he started
debugging and then he uh

820
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
debugging and then he uh
 

821
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,350
debugging and then he uh
thought if he found the problem it

822
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
thought if he found the problem it
 

823
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,910
thought if he found the problem it
started working so he implemented the

824
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
started working so he implemented the
 

825
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,949
started working so he implemented the
solution and he

826
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
solution and he
 

827
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,870
solution and he
installed once again and it would still

828
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
installed once again and it would still
 

829
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,030
installed once again and it would still
hang

830
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
hang
 

831
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,430
hang
and then he was uh i mentioned and then

832
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
and then he was uh i mentioned and then
 

833
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,430
and then he was uh i mentioned and then
he thought that maybe something is

834
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
he thought that maybe something is
 

835
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,509
he thought that maybe something is
waiting for some input and it's not

836
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
waiting for some input and it's not
 

837
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,350
waiting for some input and it's not
displaying on the screen and he

838
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
displaying on the screen and he
 

839
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,749
displaying on the screen and he
tried for several hours no nothing is

840
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
tried for several hours no nothing is
 

841
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,949
tried for several hours no nothing is
waiting for anything when

842
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
waiting for anything when
 

843
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,350
waiting for anything when
when pgp when you used to generate a key

844
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
when pgp when you used to generate a key
 

845
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,110
when pgp when you used to generate a key
with pgp it was the same thing you had

846
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
with pgp it was the same thing you had
 

847
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,949
with pgp it was the same thing you had
to type on the keyboard or you had to

848
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
to type on the keyboard or you had to
 

849
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,350
to type on the keyboard or you had to
run the mouse or whatever yeah but they

850
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
run the mouse or whatever yeah but they
 

851
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,269
run the mouse or whatever yeah but they
would put up a message on the console to

852
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
would put up a message on the console to
 

853
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,470
would put up a message on the console to
say

854
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
say
 

855
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,470
say
give us some random data by typing the

856
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
give us some random data by typing the
 

857
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,990
give us some random data by typing the
keyboard or running the mouse around

858
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
keyboard or running the mouse around
 

859
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,710
keyboard or running the mouse around
yeah but

860
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
yeah but
 

861
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,749
yeah but
then you you had a console open that

862
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
then you you had a console open that
 

863
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,150
then you you had a console open that
would

864
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
would
 

865
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,790
would
tell you these things you can't generate

866
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
tell you these things you can't generate
 

867
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,790
tell you these things you can't generate
a pgp key otherwise

868
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
a pgp key otherwise
 

869
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,030
a pgp key otherwise
yeah but um in the most uh the gui

870
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
yeah but um in the most uh the gui
 

871
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,829
yeah but um in the most uh the gui
applications

872
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
applications
 

873
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,069
applications
yeah if there is our console message it

874
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
yeah if there is our console message it
 

875
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,670
yeah if there is our console message it
would not show up in there if you just

876
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
would not show up in there if you just
 

877
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,590
would not show up in there if you just
show yourself

878
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
show yourself
 

879
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,230
show yourself
yeah you just throw a pop-up on the

880
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
yeah you just throw a pop-up on the
 

881
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,990
yeah you just throw a pop-up on the
screen i mean that works too right yeah

882
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
screen i mean that works too right yeah
 

883
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,310
screen i mean that works too right yeah
if

884
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
if
 

885
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,470
if
you if it is important enough and they

886
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
you if it is important enough and they
 

887
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,590
you if it is important enough and they
have accounted for

888
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
have accounted for
 

889
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,189
have accounted for
this particular pop message

890
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
this particular pop message
 

891
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,150
this particular pop message
to show so i would think hanging i would

892
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
to show so i would think hanging i would
 

893
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,069
to show so i would think hanging i would
think making the process hang

894
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
think making the process hang
 

895
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,829
think making the process hang
is important enough to put a message up

896
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
is important enough to put a message up
 

897
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,350
is important enough to put a message up
to say give us some random data

898
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
to say give us some random data
 

899
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,990
to say give us some random data
yeah but um interesting yeah but this

900
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
yeah but um interesting yeah but this
 

901
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,990
yeah but um interesting yeah but this
was the problem he was debugging and he

902
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
was the problem he was debugging and he
 

903
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,949
was the problem he was debugging and he
found out that there was not enough and

904
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
found out that there was not enough and
 

905
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,310
found out that there was not enough and
the colonel had uh

906
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
the colonel had uh
 

907
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,430
the colonel had uh
run out of uh entropy

908
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
run out of uh entropy
 

909
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,470
run out of uh entropy
and so he was working to figure to

910
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
and so he was working to figure to
 

911
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,189
and so he was working to figure to
thinking about what would generate

912
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
thinking about what would generate
 

913
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,350
thinking about what would generate
entropy and that is

914
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
entropy and that is
 

915
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,069
entropy and that is
either typing on the keyboard uh or in

916
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
either typing on the keyboard uh or in
 

917
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,710
either typing on the keyboard uh or in
the disk

918
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
the disk
 

919
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,390
the disk
right or read or in some selected cases

920
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
right or read or in some selected cases
 

921
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,750
right or read or in some selected cases
and

922
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
and
 

923
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,990
and
network traffic but in this stage of the

924
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
network traffic but in this stage of the
 

925
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,510
network traffic but in this stage of the
installation there is no more network

926
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
installation there is no more network
 

927
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,990
installation there is no more network
traffic

928
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
traffic
 

929
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,669
traffic
it has already downloaded all everything

930
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
it has already downloaded all everything
 

931
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,669
it has already downloaded all everything
it needs to know so yeah

932
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
it needs to know so yeah
 

933
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,669
it needs to know so yeah
and what's the purpose in it what's the

934
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
and what's the purpose in it what's the
 

935
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,510
and what's the purpose in it what's the
purpose in the installer being so

936
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
purpose in the installer being so
 

937
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,750
purpose in the installer being so
secure that it needs that much entropy

938
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
secure that it needs that much entropy
 

939
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,590
secure that it needs that much entropy
it's not the installer it is it is a

940
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
it's not the installer it is it is a
 

941
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,230
it's not the installer it is it is a
package

942
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
package
 

943
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,870
package
who needs a truly random number in order

944
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
who needs a truly random number in order
 

945
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,630
who needs a truly random number in order
to generate a key

946
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
to generate a key
 

947
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,990
to generate a key
for kerberos yeah

948
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
for kerberos yeah
 

949
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,630
for kerberos yeah
um which is like ssh it's like

950
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
um which is like ssh it's like
 

951
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,110
um which is like ssh it's like
generating keys like ssh does yeah or

952
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
generating keys like ssh does yeah or
 

953
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,070
generating keys like ssh does yeah or
pgp

954
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
pgp
 

955
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,150
pgp
yeah okay

956
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160

 

957
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,110

and then he and um and and then nothing

958
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
and then he and um and and then nothing
 

959
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,590
and then he and um and and then nothing
is

960
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
is
 

961
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,789
is
generic in in uh reading or earning

962
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
generic in in uh reading or earning
 

963
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,549
generic in in uh reading or earning
to the disc because everything is

964
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
to the disc because everything is
 

965
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:03,750
to the disc because everything is
waiting for something yeah

966
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760

 

967
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,110

was the last step and he figured out uh

968
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
was the last step and he figured out uh
 

969
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,390
was the last step and he figured out uh
eventually he figured out that all he

970
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
eventually he figured out that all he
 

971
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,110
eventually he figured out that all he
had to do was to change the tte

972
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
had to do was to change the tte
 

973
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,909
had to do was to change the tte
a few times that was enough because you

974
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
a few times that was enough because you
 

975
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,110
a few times that was enough because you
were tapping on the keyboard in order to

976
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
were tapping on the keyboard in order to
 

977
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,750
were tapping on the keyboard in order to
do that

978
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
do that
 

979
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,590
do that
so the solution that he came up with

980
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
so the solution that he came up with
 

981
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,070
so the solution that he came up with
which is i think that they are still

982
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
which is i think that they are still

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,029
which is i think that they are still

the ubuntu installer and all the
derivatives there is a process running

988
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
derivatives there is a process running
 

989
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,669
derivatives there is a process running
that is checking for um

990
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
that is checking for um
 

991
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,510
that is checking for um
a certain um proxies uh something um

992
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
a certain um proxies uh something um
 

993
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,350
a certain um proxies uh something um
wherever the available entropy is listed

994
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
wherever the available entropy is listed
 

995
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,750
wherever the available entropy is listed
and if it's below us a certain number

996
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
and if it's below us a certain number
 

997
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,270
and if it's below us a certain number
um he have uh here um

998
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
um he have uh here um
 

999
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,710
um he have uh here um
a command is flushing the disk

1000
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
a command is flushing the disk
 

1001
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,510
a command is flushing the disk
and it starts uh a fine command on the

1002
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
and it starts uh a fine command on the
 

1003
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,710
and it starts uh a fine command on the
slash root

1004
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
slash root
 

1005
00:18:50,720 --> 00:19:02,230
slash root
yeah that'll do it that'll do it

1006
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240

 

1007
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,310

whatever he did in order to debug it

1008
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
whatever he did in order to debug it
 

1009
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,909
whatever he did in order to debug it
worked it was subversive yeah

1010
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
worked it was subversive yeah
 

1011
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,630
worked it was subversive yeah
so yeah encryption keys are they can be

1012
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
so yeah encryption keys are they can be
 

1013
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,350
so yeah encryption keys are they can be
pretty long

1014
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
pretty long
 

1015
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,590
pretty long
that's crazy i just think like for a

1016
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
that's crazy i just think like for a
 

1017
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,710
that's crazy i just think like for a
password or something i'll just take the

1018
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
password or something i'll just take the
 

1019
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,590
password or something i'll just take the
micro time

1020
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
micro time
 

1021
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,390
micro time
and shot 256 it and cut it off at 32

1022
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
and shot 256 it and cut it off at 32
 

1023
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,909
and shot 256 it and cut it off at 32
characters or something

1024
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
characters or something
 

1025
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,950
characters or something
yeah like it's random enough

1026
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
yeah like it's random enough
 

1027
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,390
yeah like it's random enough
so pretty unlikely for you to replicate

1028
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
so pretty unlikely for you to replicate
 

1029
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,350
so pretty unlikely for you to replicate
it

1030
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
it
 

1031
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,430
it
or i could add a salt or something throw

1032
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
or i could add a salt or something throw
 

1033
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,630
or i could add a salt or something throw
salt on there

1034
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
salt on there
 

1035
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,630
salt on there
and then what are the chances of

1036
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
and then what are the chances of
 

1037
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,430
and then what are the chances of
replicating that right

1038
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
replicating that right
 

1039
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,669
replicating that right
wow well i think i've mentioned that the

1040
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
wow well i think i've mentioned that the
 

1041
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,549
wow well i think i've mentioned that the
uh

1042
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
uh
 

1043
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,150
uh
that the pine phone is um looking a lot

1044
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
that the pine phone is um looking a lot
 

1045
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,870
that the pine phone is um looking a lot
better now after its latest update

1046
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
better now after its latest update
 

1047
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,070
better now after its latest update
now it um properly um

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
now it um properly um
 

1049
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,830
now it um properly um
keeps track of the time which is just

1050
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:52,840
keeps track of the time which is just
 

1051
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,549
keeps track of the time which is just
fantastic

1052
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
fantastic
 

1053
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,669
fantastic
finally keeping track of the time next

1054
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
finally keeping track of the time next
 

1055
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,230
finally keeping track of the time next
time you can they can take calls on your

that it's not that it's not getting a
signal oh there it is the phone just

1074
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
signal oh there it is the phone just
 

1075
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,710
signal oh there it is the phone just
came up

1076
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
came up
 

1077
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,190
came up
the phone icon just came up so that's

1078
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
the phone icon just came up so that's
 

1079
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,350
the phone icon just came up so that's
good

1080

1081
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,789

did you program any of that the only

1082
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
did you program any of that the only
 

1083
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,029
did you program any of that the only
thing i had to program

1084
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
thing i had to program
 

1085
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,149
thing i had to program
program was the credentials for the uh

1086
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,159
program was the credentials for the uh
 

1087
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,590
program was the credentials for the uh
for the hotspot for the wi-fi router oh

1088
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
for the hotspot for the wi-fi router oh
 

1089
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,710
for the hotspot for the wi-fi router oh
um and it it will correctly connect into

1090
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
um and it it will correctly connect into
 

1091
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,549
um and it it will correctly connect into
that although the icon right now doesn't

1092
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
that although the icon right now doesn't
 

1093
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:42,950
that although the icon right now doesn't
say

1094
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:42,960
say
 

1095
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,590
say
doesn't say it is uh putting a new

1096
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
doesn't say it is uh putting a new
 

1097
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,110
doesn't say it is uh putting a new
putting a sim in there i put a

1098
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
putting a sim in there i put a
 

1099
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,870
putting a sim in there i put a
pay-as-you-go sim in there

1100
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
pay-as-you-go sim in there
 

1101
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,110
pay-as-you-go sim in there
based on one of our networks here and it

1102
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
based on one of our networks here and it
 

1103
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,149
based on one of our networks here and it
just came right up

1104
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
just came right up
 

1105
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,070
just came right up
i didn't have to do anything and it just

1106
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
i didn't have to do anything and it just
 

1107
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,510
i didn't have to do anything and it just
literally came right up

1108
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
literally came right up
 

1109
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,270
literally came right up
and i started getting text messages

1110
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
and i started getting text messages
 

1111
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,510
and i started getting text messages
right away to say your new phone number

1112
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
right away to say your new phone number
 

1113
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,350
right away to say your new phone number
is and

1114
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360

 

1115
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,630

uh battery life is still is still

1116
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
uh battery life is still is still
 

1117
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,350
uh battery life is still is still
a bit iffy it won't last more than more

1118
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
a bit iffy it won't last more than more
 

1119
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,750
a bit iffy it won't last more than more
than

1120
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
than
 

1121
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,430
than
maybe eight nine hours something like

1122
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
maybe eight nine hours something like
 

1123
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,870
maybe eight nine hours something like
that so

1124
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
that so
 

1125
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,990
that so
um that's still that's still working the

1126
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
um that's still that's still working the
 

1127
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,750
um that's still that's still working the
camera works now

1128
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
camera works now
 

1129
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,990
camera works now
i can um the camera wasn't even working

1130
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
i can um the camera wasn't even working
 

1131
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,789
i can um the camera wasn't even working
previously

1132
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
previously
 

1133
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,149
previously
but um if i turn the camera on then it

1134
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
but um if i turn the camera on then it
 

1135
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,950
but um if i turn the camera on then it
will actually

1136
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
will actually
 

1137
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,029
will actually
uh it will actually at least show an

1138
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
uh it will actually at least show an
 

1139
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,549
uh it will actually at least show an
image i haven't tried taking photos or

1140
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
image i haven't tried taking photos or
 

1141
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,669
image i haven't tried taking photos or
any of that but

1142
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
any of that but
 

1143
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,390
any of that but

intellij idea or any of that just use vi
uh don't try to run vss code it's just

1322
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
uh don't try to run vss code it's just
 

1323
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,510
uh don't try to run vss code it's just
too slow

1324
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
too slow
 

1325
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,149
too slow
and i don't expect it

you can use nano if you want yeah but
 

1329
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,390
you can use nano if you want yeah but
the key point though

00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,400
the key point though
 

1331
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,549
the key point though
the key point though is that you use

1332

the key point though is that you use
 

1333
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,750
the key point though is that you use
make

1334
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
make
 

1335
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,909

um
 

1351
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,350
um
an application that was that was written

1352
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
an application that was that was written
 

1353
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,390
an application that was that was written
in pascal

1354
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
in pascal
 

1355
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,230
in pascal
it had a make file so i was able to type

1356
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
it had a make file so i was able to type
 

1357
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,070
it had a make file so i was able to type
make in it and it didn't make but what

1358
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
make in it and it didn't make but what
 

1359
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,870
make in it and it didn't make but what
it does

1360
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
it does
 

1361
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,590
it does
is it calls the lazarus ide and then

1362
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
is it calls the lazarus ide and then
 

1363
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,990
is it calls the lazarus ide and then
caught and makes the ide do the build

1364
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
caught and makes the ide do the build
 

1365
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,310
caught and makes the ide do the build
instead of doing all the build in the in

1366
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
instead of doing all the build in the in
 

1367
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,149
instead of doing all the build in the in
the make file like it should do

1368
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
the make file like it should do
 

1369
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,430
the make file like it should do
so if you don't have lazarus the

1370
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
so if you don't have lazarus the
 

1371
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,430
so if you don't have lazarus the
makefile won't work

1372
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
makefile won't work
 

1373
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,710
makefile won't work

1381
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,549

should not should not be calling an ide

1382
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
should not should not be calling an ide
 

1383
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,110

to perform the the build process
 

1385
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,470
to perform the the build process
it should be yeah calling the compiler

1386
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
it should be yeah calling the compiler
 

1387
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,470
it should be yeah calling the compiler
right we just imagine it's just

1388
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
right we just imagine it's just
 

1389
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,390
right we just imagine it's just
compiling in the command line yeah

1390
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,400
compiling in the command line yeah
 

1391
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:37,029
compiling in the command line yeah
there's a lot of um

1392
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039

 

1393
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,190

but the makefile just calls lazarus and

1394
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
but the makefile just calls lazarus and
 

1395
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,549
but the makefile just calls lazarus and
says hey lazarus go build this project

1396
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559
says hey lazarus go build this project
 

1397
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,549
says hey lazarus go build this project
so you know if you don't have pretty
