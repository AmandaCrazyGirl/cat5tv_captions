doug
no okay because that's the here at the

380
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
no okay because that's the here at the
 

381
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,629
no okay because that's the here at the
studio it's a little different because i

382
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
studio it's a little different because i
 

383
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,550
studio it's a little different because i
have a server so i have virtualbox

384
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
have a server so i have virtualbox
 

385
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,070
have a server so i have virtualbox
installed and i actually run it as a

386
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
installed and i actually run it as a
 

387
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,670
installed and i actually run it as a
debian virtual machine

388
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
debian virtual machine
 

389
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,990
debian virtual machine
so you can always it is just a linux

390
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
so you can always it is just a linux
 

391
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,749
so you can always it is just a linux
application so you can follow the steps

392
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
application so you can follow the steps
 

393
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,230
application so you can follow the steps
i did in this in the tutorial and you

394
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
i did in this in the tutorial and you
 

395
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,150
i did in this in the tutorial and you
should be able to install it on any

396
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
should be able to install it on any
 

397
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,990
should be able to install it on any
linux machine but you just want to make

398
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
linux machine but you just want to make
 

399
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,670
linux machine but you just want to make
sure it's something that can always be

400
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
sure it's something that can always be
 

401
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:11,990
sure it's something that can always be
up

402
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
up
 

403
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,150
up
that's all because as soon as as soon as

404
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
that's all because as soon as as soon as
 

405
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,189
that's all because as soon as as soon as
you turn it off

406
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
you turn it off
 

407
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,390
you turn it off
like you wouldn't put it on your desktop

408
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
like you wouldn't put it on your desktop
 

409
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,589
like you wouldn't put it on your desktop
computer because as soon as you turn it

all of the internet goes down because

414
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
all of the internet goes down because
 

415
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,430
all of the internet goes down because
you've lost all dns

416
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
you've lost all dns
 

417
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,909
you've lost all dns
yeah so just make sure something

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
yeah so just make sure something
 

419
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,189
yeah so just make sure something
reliable that's all

420
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
reliable that's all
 

421
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,029
reliable that's all
i've got a computer running point linux

422
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
i've got a computer running point linux
 

423
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,950
i've got a computer running point linux
that i might be able to put it on

424
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
that i might be able to put it on
 

425
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,950
that i might be able to put it on
yeah yeah just make sure it's reliable

426
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
yeah yeah just make sure it's reliable
 

427

that you as soon as you install a pie
 

431
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,589
that you as soon as you install a pie
hole you have to

432
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
hole you have to
 

433
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,990
hole you have to
immediately go to it's probably dns when

434
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
immediately go to it's probably dns when
 

435
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,749
immediately go to it's probably dns when
there's a problem with the internet

436
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
there's a problem with the internet
 

437
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,150
there's a problem with the internet
because um i've had it happen where you

438
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
because um i've had it happen where you
 

439
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,230
because um i've had it happen where you
know i've accidentally unplugged my

440
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
know i've accidentally unplugged my
 

441
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,390
know i've accidentally unplugged my
pie hole and internet goes down for the

442
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
pie hole and internet goes down for the
 

443
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,510
pie hole and internet goes down for the
whole house and you're looking around

444
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
whole house and you're looking around
 

445
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,869
whole house and you're looking around
trying to figure out why is internet

446
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
trying to figure out why is internet
 

447
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,589
trying to figure out why is internet
down

448
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
down
 

449
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,830
down
and it turns out my dns server was down

450
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
and it turns out my dns server was down
 

451
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,510
and it turns out my dns server was down
so it's just not resolving so the first

452
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
so it's just not resolving so the first
 

453
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,710
so it's just not resolving so the first
test you can do is just

454
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
test you can do is just
 

455
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,830
test you can do is just
ping an ip address on the public public

456
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
ping an ip address on the public public
 

457
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,230
ping an ip address on the public public
land

458
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
land
 

459
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,670
land
and you know like 8.8.8.8 is a really

460
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
and you know like 8.8.8.8 is a really
 

461
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,510
and you know like 8.8.8.8 is a really
easy one to remember so ping it

462
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
easy one to remember so ping it
 

463
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,110
easy one to remember so ping it
see if it replies and if it does you

464
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
see if it replies and if it does you
 

465
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,629
see if it replies and if it does you
know it's your dns

466
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
know it's your dns
 

467
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,670
know it's your dns
what does that come back to that's

468
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
what does that come back to that's
 

469
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,070
what does that come back to that's
uh the dns servers at google that's what

470
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
uh the dns servers at google that's what
 

471
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,110
uh the dns servers at google that's what
i thought okay

472
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
i thought okay
 

473
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,670
i thought okay
yeah yeah and there are others so it's

474
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
yeah yeah and there are others so it's
 

475
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,309
yeah yeah and there are others so it's
just a way

476
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
just a way
 

477
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,550
just a way
because if your pie hole goes down

478
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
because if your pie hole goes down
 

479
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,150
because if your pie hole goes down
google.com will not come

480
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
google.com will not come
 

481
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,830
google.com will not come
up but 8.8.8.8 will so because dns is

482
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
up but 8.8.8.8 will so because dns is
 

483
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,469
up but 8.8.8.8 will so because dns is
specifically domain name resolution so

484
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
specifically domain name resolution so
 

485
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,550
specifically domain name resolution so
it converts the dot com to an ip address

486
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
it converts the dot com to an ip address
 

487
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,070
it converts the dot com to an ip address
as long as you know the ip address you

488
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
as long as you know the ip address you
 

489
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,589
as long as you know the ip address you
can get there anyway

490
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
can get there anyway
 

491
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,469
can get there anyway
but it's a quick way to test if your dns

492
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
but it's a quick way to test if your dns
 

493
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,070
but it's a quick way to test if your dns
server is the problem

494
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
server is the problem
 

495
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,110
server is the problem
right okay

496
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
right okay
 

497
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,310
right okay
so a quick question for for anyone in in

498
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
so a quick question for for anyone in in
 

499
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,630
so a quick question for for anyone in in
the

500
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
the
 

501
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,550
the
in the chat um the pine book pro

502
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
in the chat um the pine book pro
 

503
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,590
in the chat um the pine book pro
uh and probably my my new lap my laptop

504
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
uh and probably my my new lap my laptop
 

505
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,470
uh and probably my my new lap my laptop
with uh

506
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
with uh
 

507
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,470
with uh
uh ubuntu two 2020 on it

508
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
uh ubuntu two 2020 on it
 

509
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,829
uh ubuntu two 2020 on it
um it will use

510
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
um it will use
 

511
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,949
um it will use
a dns address of 127.0.0.53

512
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
a dns address of 127.0.0.53
 

513
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,150
a dns address of 127.0.0.53
and that seems to cause a delay

514
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
and that seems to cause a delay
 

515
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,870
and that seems to cause a delay
in name resolution every single time and

516
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
in name resolution every single time and
 

517
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,590
in name resolution every single time and
if i

518
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
if i
 

519
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,949
if i
go into etsyresolve.com and change that

520
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
go into etsyresolve.com and change that
 

521
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,829
go into etsyresolve.com and change that
to my

522
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
to my
 

523
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,430
to my
local router 192.168.

524
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
local router 192.168.
 

525
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,550
local router 192.168.
whatever it is then it works

526
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
whatever it is then it works
 

527
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,350
whatever it is then it works
every single time yeah have you seen

528
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
every single time yeah have you seen
 

529
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,750
every single time yeah have you seen
that

530
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
that
 

531
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,910
that
and what's the what's the solution for

532
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
and what's the what's the solution for
 

533
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,990
and what's the what's the solution for
that i mean it looks like

534
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
that i mean it looks like
 

535
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,150
that i mean it looks like
that 127.0.0.53

536
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
that 127.0.0.53
 

537
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,389
that 127.0.0.53
is designed to dynamically switch dns

538
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
is designed to dynamically switch dns
 

539
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,910
is designed to dynamically switch dns
depending on whether you have a wi-fi

540
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
depending on whether you have a wi-fi
 

541
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,190
depending on whether you have a wi-fi
connection or a wired connection to

542
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
connection or a wired connection to
 

543
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,790
connection or a wired connection to
wherever the case may be

544
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
wherever the case may be
 

545
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,230
wherever the case may be
but it just seems to be great it's a

546
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
but it just seems to be great it's a
 

547
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,630
but it just seems to be great it's a
hard time so

548
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640

 

549
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,350

i it's why it's using a loopback but uh

550
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
i it's why it's using a loopback but uh
 

551
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,509
i it's why it's using a loopback but uh
i think your solution is correct

552
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
i think your solution is correct
 

553
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,470
i think your solution is correct
uh you say etsy i always say etc so i

554
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
uh you say etsy i always say etc so i
 

555
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,990
uh you say etsy i always say etc so i
gotta get into the habit of saying etsy

556
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
gotta get into the habit of saying etsy
 

557
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,790
gotta get into the habit of saying etsy
i like it

558
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
i like it
 

559
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,509
i like it
um so in etsyresolve.com yeah i think

560
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
um so in etsyresolve.com yeah i think
 

561
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,870
um so in etsyresolve.com yeah i think
your solution is perfect

562
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880

 

563
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,269

oh every time you power it up yeah

564
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
oh every time you power it up yeah
 

565
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,310
oh every time you power it up yeah
because oh

566
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
because oh
 

567
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,910
because oh
change the permissions on the file so it

568
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
change the permissions on the file so it
 

569
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,670
change the permissions on the file so it
doesn't get rewritten well

570
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
doesn't get rewritten well
 

571
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,910
doesn't get rewritten well
what happens is that the um there is a

572
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
what happens is that the um there is a
 

573
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,190
what happens is that the um there is a
process

574
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
process
 

575
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,110
process
um and i'm trying to remember the name

576
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
um and i'm trying to remember the name
 

577
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,790
um and i'm trying to remember the name
of it that i can't remember

578
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
of it that i can't remember
 

579
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,069
of it that i can't remember
but what it does is it it overwrites

580
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
but what it does is it it overwrites
 

581
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,590
but what it does is it it overwrites
the at the etc resolve dot com

582
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
the at the etc resolve dot com
 

583
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,030
the at the etc resolve dot com
yeah and uh it rewrites the 120

584
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
yeah and uh it rewrites the 120
 

585
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,590
yeah and uh it rewrites the 120
uh 127.0.0.53 on startup every time

586
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
uh 127.0.0.53 on startup every time
 

587
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,670
uh 127.0.0.53 on startup every time
you're on a 192 network right so

588
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
you're on a 192 network right so
 

589
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,829
you're on a 192 network right so
create a client you create a cron job as

590
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839

this is an actual command so at reboot

and rewrite the file with the correct

618
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
and rewrite the file with the correct
 

619
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,509

and then if that's hacky then yeah i

622
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
and then if that's hacky then yeah i
 

623
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,190
and then if that's hacky then yeah i
know it works

624
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
know it works
 

625
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,949
know it works
but it depends on when it runs because

626
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
but it depends on when it runs because
 

627

it may come right behind that job yes

636
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
it may come right behind that job yes
 

637
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,230
it may come right behind that job yes
okay

or have it run have it run have it run

650
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
or have it run have it run have it run
 

651
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,230
or have it run have it run have it run
every 15 minutes

652
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
every 15 minutes
 

653
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,910
every 15 minutes
so just go star star slash 15

654
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
so just go star star slash 15
 

655
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,550
so just go star star slash 15
space star space star space star space

656
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560

star
 

659
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,350
star
and then the command and that will run

660
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
and then the command and that will run
 

661
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,389
and then the command and that will run
once i

662
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
once i
 

663
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,509
once i
do it once i do it and make the change

664
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
do it once i do it and make the change
 

665
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,190
do it once i do it and make the change
it never changes after that not until i

666
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
it never changes after that not until i
 

667
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,790
it never changes after that not until i
reboot so there you go

668
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
reboot so there you go
 

669
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,790
reboot so there you go
yeah so i only have to worry about

670
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
yeah so i only have to worry about
 

671
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,790
yeah so i only have to worry about
reboot so

672
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
reboot so
 

673
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,910
reboot so
anyway back to you doug you were

674
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
anyway back to you doug you were
 

675
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,910
anyway back to you doug you were
we rooted rudely interrupted you

676
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920

 

677
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,150

that was the next question doug no i was

678
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
that was the next question doug no i was
 

679
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,269
that was the next question doug no i was
just saying i'd have to

680
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
just saying i'd have to
 

681
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,790
just saying i'd have to
switch to something a little bit more

682
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
switch to something a little bit more
 

683
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,949
switch to something a little bit more
suitable the um

684
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
suitable the um
 

685
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,470
suitable the um
that's very probably probably wouldn't

686
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
that's very probably probably wouldn't
 

687
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,069
that's very probably probably wouldn't
be able to handle it it's too slow

688
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
be able to handle it it's too slow
 

689
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,069
be able to handle it it's too slow
doesn't have enough memory not enough

690
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
doesn't have enough memory not enough
 

691
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,750
doesn't have enough memory not enough
ram i should say

692
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
ram i should say
 

693
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,670
ram i should say
the pie hole your hole is pretty

694
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
the pie hole your hole is pretty
 

695
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,350
the pie hole your hole is pretty
lightweight i would just suggest you

696
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
lightweight i would just suggest you
 

697
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,629
lightweight i would just suggest you
turn off the logging

698
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
turn off the logging
 

699
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,069
turn off the logging
just turn off logging so it's not

700
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
just turn off logging so it's not
 

701
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,150
just turn off logging so it's not
constantly writing to the sd card

702
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
constantly writing to the sd card
 

703
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,030
constantly writing to the sd card
otherwise it's gonna

704
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
otherwise it's gonna
 

705
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,230
otherwise it's gonna
ah okay kill it a lot sooner yeah

706
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
ah okay kill it a lot sooner yeah
 

707
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,790
ah okay kill it a lot sooner yeah
but but i mean it's just about a by nine

708
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
but but i mean it's just about a by nine
 

709
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,350
but but i mean it's just about a by nine
server

710
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
server
 

711
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,910
server
at its heart so with a with a blacklist

712
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
at its heart so with a with a blacklist
 

713
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,030
at its heart so with a with a blacklist
so you just

714
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
so you just
 

715
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,030
so you just
it's not really doing much outside of

716
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
it's not really doing much outside of
 

717
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,030
it's not really doing much outside of
ram as long as it's not logging

718
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
ram as long as it's not logging
 

719
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,949
ram as long as it's not logging
so a raspberry pi 2 would do it just

720
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
so a raspberry pi 2 would do it just
 

721
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,949
so a raspberry pi 2 would do it just
fine okay

722
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
fine okay
 

723
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,190
fine okay
yeah okay yeah i've got a raspberry pi 3

724
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
yeah okay yeah i've got a raspberry pi 3
 

725
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,790
yeah okay yeah i've got a raspberry pi 3
so perfect yeah

726
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
so perfect yeah
 

727
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,069
so perfect yeah
that worked just fine just watch the

728
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
that worked just fine just watch the
 

729
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,230
that worked just fine just watch the
logs yeah

730
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
logs yeah
 

731
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,389
logs yeah
and whatever you do put it on a ups or

732
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
and whatever you do put it on a ups or
 

733
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,750
and whatever you do put it on a ups or
something because if it ever

734
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
something because if it ever
 

735
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,949
something because if it ever
loses power unexpectedly it could work

736
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
loses power unexpectedly it could work
 

737
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,509
loses power unexpectedly it could work
that sd card yeah the kid will have to

738
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
that sd card yeah the kid will have to
 

739
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,150
that sd card yeah the kid will have to
put it into a

740
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
put it into a
 

741
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,350
put it into a
voyager on it what's that rob

742
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
voyager on it what's that rob
 

743
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,910
voyager on it what's that rob
uh pi voyager is my favorite uh from

744
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920

um just do a search supply

748
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
um just do a search supply
 

749
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,949
um just do a search supply
yes but it it's a smart intelligent

750
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
yes but it it's a smart intelligent
 

751
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,310
yes but it it's a smart intelligent
battery backup so if the battery

752
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
battery backup so if the battery
 

753
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,030
battery backup so if the battery
depletes

754
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
depletes
 

755
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,110
depletes
it will safely shut down the raspberry

756
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
it will safely shut down the raspberry
 

757
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,230
it will safely shut down the raspberry
pi

758
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
pi
 

759
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,189
pi
uh i'm like i'm like just plugging it in

760
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
uh i'm like i'm like just plugging it in
 

761
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,230
uh i'm like i'm like just plugging it in
oh yeah but i don't have to

762
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
oh yeah but i don't have to
 

763
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,910
oh yeah but i don't have to
i don't have to worry about the arduino

764
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
i don't have to worry about the arduino
 

765
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,509
i don't have to worry about the arduino
shutting down because it's all firmware

766
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
shutting down because it's all firmware
 

767
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,030
shutting down because it's all firmware
right once you've programmed it

768
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
right once you've programmed it
 

769
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,910
right once you've programmed it
that's it you're in you know even if the

770
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
that's it you're in you know even if the
 

771
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,509
that's it you're in you know even if the
power goes off unexpectedly it just

772
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
power goes off unexpectedly it just
 

773
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,310
power goes off unexpectedly it just
comes right back

774
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
comes right back
 

775
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,790
comes right back
back up again but uh i have a battery

776
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
back up again but uh i have a battery
 

777
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,069
back up again but uh i have a battery
backup for the arduino

778
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
backup for the arduino
 

779
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,590
backup for the arduino
so that works all right

780
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
so that works all right
 

781
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,030
so that works all right

need to hook up my
kilowatt to it and see how many amps

958
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
kilowatt to it and see how many amps
 

959
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,310
kilowatt to it and see how many amps
it's actually drawing

960
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
it's actually drawing
 

961
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,350
it's actually drawing
because i don't i don't know it's a

962
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
because i don't i don't know it's a
 

963
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,110
because i don't i don't know it's a
three amp power supply it might only be

964
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
three amp power supply it might only be
 

965
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,190
three amp power supply it might only be
drawing one for all i know

966
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
drawing one for all i know
 

967
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,430
drawing one for all i know
so there may be some startup brush

968
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
so there may be some startup brush
 

969
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,110
so there may be some startup brush
current though it may take

970
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
current though it may take
 

971
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,070
current though it may take
it may take momentarily to get started

972
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
it may take momentarily to get started
 

973
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,430
it may take momentarily to get started
and then settle on

974
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
and then settle on
 

975
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,990
and then settle on
on like one amp that's an interesting

976
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
on like one amp that's an interesting
 

977
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,789
on like one amp that's an interesting
point

978
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
point
 

979
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,789
point
so if i got a power supply like like

980
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
so if i got a power supply like like
 

981
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,150
so if i got a power supply like like
peter was recommending i get this kind

982
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
peter was recommending i get this kind
 

983
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,470
peter was recommending i get this kind
of

984
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
of
 

985
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,310
of
uh universal power supply that had

986
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
uh universal power supply that had
 

987
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,630
uh universal power supply that had
enough amperage at 15 volts that i could

988
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
enough amperage at 15 volts that i could
 

989
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,990
enough amperage at 15 volts that i could
just wire everything in a circuit

990
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
just wire everything in a circuit
 

991
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,470
just wire everything in a circuit
but i wonder if i could like create a

992
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
but i wonder if i could like create a
 

993
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,430
but i wonder if i could like create a
bit of a relay

994
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
bit of a relay
 

995
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,150
bit of a relay
circuit that would like trip them after

996
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
circuit that would like trip them after
 

997
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,510
circuit that would like trip them after
like a timer so that

998
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
like a timer so that
 

999
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,750
like a timer so that
like light one comes on light two comes

1000
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
like light one comes on light two comes
 

1001
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,029
like light one comes on light two comes
on light three comes on

1002
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
on light three comes on
 

1003
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,150
on light three comes on
five five five dimensions by five timers

1004
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
five five five dimensions by five timers
 

1005
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,950
five five five dimensions by five timers
yeah right

1006
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
yeah right
 

1007
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,310
yeah right
what does that mean what are they called

1008
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
what does that mean what are they called
 

1009
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,710
what does that mean what are they called
there's an ic called a five five

1010
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
there's an ic called a five five
 

1011
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,110
there's an ic called a five five
five and it you can you put that in a

1012
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
five and it you can you put that in a
 

1013
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,990
five and it you can you put that in a
circuit

1014
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
circuit
 

1015
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,070
circuit
you can put that in a circuit to cause a

1016
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
you can put that in a circuit to cause a
 

1017
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,350
you can put that in a circuit to cause a
time for my

1018
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
time for my
 

1019
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,990
time for my
wouldn't that be that's clever i will

1020
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
wouldn't that be that's clever i will
 

1021
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,390
wouldn't that be that's clever i will
give you the circuit right bobby via

1022
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
give you the circuit right bobby via
 

1023
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,549
give you the circuit right bobby via
if things that doesn't go again i've

1024
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
if things that doesn't go again i've
 

1025
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,830
if things that doesn't go again i've
already had to go on

1026
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
already had to go on
 

1027
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,870
already had to go on
about that because i'm annoyed with that

1028
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
about that because i'm annoyed with that
 

1029
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,630
about that because i'm annoyed with that
i am very inaudible because he's been

1030
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
i am very inaudible because he's been
 

1031
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,110
i am very inaudible because he's been
doing this for a month

1032
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
doing this for a month
 

1033
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,549
doing this for a month
and uh they got you to find the fault i

1034
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
and uh they got you to find the fault i
 

1035
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,549
and uh they got you to find the fault i
asked them for about them

1036
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
asked them for about them
 

1037
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,549
asked them for about them
and um and they started to try to charge

1038
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
and um and they started to try to charge
 

1039
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,029
and um and they started to try to charge
me

and i pointed out to him that uh i'm
 

1043
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,510
and i pointed out to him that uh i'm
going to get an 80

1044
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
going to get an 80
 

1045

1099
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,350

them off about that one as well that's a

1100
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
them off about that one as well that's a
 

1101
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,310
them off about that one as well that's a
problem

1102
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
problem
 

1103
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,789
problem
especially especially when they set a

1104
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
especially especially when they set a
 

1105
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,390
especially especially when they set a
time of day somewhere between eight

1106
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
time of day somewhere between eight
 

1107
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,909
time of day somewhere between eight
o'clock in the morning and one o'clock

1108
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
o'clock in the morning and one o'clock
 

1109

o'clock in the morning and one o'clock
in the afternoon

1110
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
in the afternoon
 

1111
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:56,830
in the afternoon
right i mean yeah what can you do yeah

1112
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840

 

1113
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:04,230

um

1114
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240

 

1115
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,149

you know i'm trying to eliminate

1116
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
you know i'm trying to eliminate
 

1117
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,909
you know i'm trying to eliminate
problems uh

1118
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
problems uh
 

1119
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,070
problems uh
but regardless well you rent all that

1120
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
but regardless well you rent all that
 

1121
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,029
but regardless well you rent all that
from

1122
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
from
 

1123
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,870
from
you rent all that from british telecom

1124
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
you rent all that from british telecom
 

1125
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,549
you rent all that from british telecom
right so they they should be able to

1126
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
right so they they should be able to
 

1127
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,230
right so they they should be able to
replace them they've done that for me

1128
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
replace them they've done that for me
 

1129
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:24,789
replace them they've done that for me
not not bt but uh my local um

dessert you've got early days because

1176
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
dessert you've got early days because
 

1177
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,029
dessert you've got early days because
it's only when you get searched with a

1178
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039
it's only when you get searched with a
 

1179
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,590
it's only when you get searched with a
uh

1180
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600

 

1181
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,870

light you know uh um

1182
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
light you know uh um
 

1183
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,909
light you know uh um
but the best thing is a one one power

1184
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
but the best thing is a one one power
 

1185
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,630
but the best thing is a one one power
supply

1186
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640
supply
 

1187
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:55,269
supply
and the other thing i was doing was i i

1188
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279

 

1189
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,070

uh the thing would actually didn't work

1190
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
uh the thing would actually didn't work
 

1191
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,750
uh the thing would actually didn't work
and i discovered why it didn't work

1192
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
and i discovered why it didn't work
 

1193
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,350
and i discovered why it didn't work
because they didn't connect the

1194
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
because they didn't connect the
 

1195
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:24,230
because they didn't connect the
the pen to

1196
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240

 

1197
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,549

a rod down the middle with an allen key

1198
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
a rod down the middle with an allen key
 

1199
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,830
a rod down the middle with an allen key
well these this one

1200
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
well these this one
 

1201
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,789
well these this one
split like like a banana before

1202
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
split like like a banana before
 

1203
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:38,310
split like like a banana before
different

1204
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320

 

1205
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,190

we modeled another one on it and uh i

1206
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
we modeled another one on it and uh i
 

1207
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,870
we modeled another one on it and uh i
got it to work again

1208
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
got it to work again
 

1209
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,070
got it to work again
uh it was all very good it's uh it

1210
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
uh it was all very good it's uh it
 

1211
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,310
uh it was all very good it's uh it
must be white band you know but uh i've

1212
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
must be white band you know but uh i've
 

1213
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,590
must be white band you know but uh i've
never had anyone

1214
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
never had anyone
 

1215
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,710
never had anyone
really in any any real real play

1216
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
really in any any real real play
 

1217
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,590
really in any any real real play
uh real success with them it seemed to

1218
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
uh real success with them it seemed to
 

1219
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,269
uh real success with them it seemed to
be a bit uh

1220
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
be a bit uh
 

1221
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,750
be a bit uh
you know up and down up and down wrong

1222
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
you know up and down up and down wrong
 

1223
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,710
you know up and down up and down wrong
yeah

1224

know all right
um i've got some homework for the rest

1232
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
um i've got some homework for the rest
 

1233
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,830
um i've got some homework for the rest
of you a lot whenever

1234

of you a lot whenever
 

1235
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,269
of you a lot whenever
whenever we get back together next week

1236
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
whenever we get back together next week
 

1237
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,350
whenever we get back together next week
because i'm i'm trying i'm trying to

1238
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
because i'm i'm trying i'm trying to
 

1239
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,430
because i'm i'm trying i'm trying to
understand the difference between

1240
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,440
understand the difference between
 

1241
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,510
understand the difference between
ssl certificates and public private key

1242
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
ssl certificates and public private key
 

1243
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,390
ssl certificates and public private key
encryption because when you when you

1244
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
encryption because when you when you
 

1245
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,430
encryption because when you when you
look at ssl

1246
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
look at ssl
 

1247
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,590
look at ssl
it seems like there's a public and a

1248
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
it seems like there's a public and a
 

1249
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,830
it seems like there's a public and a
private key in there somewhere

1250
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
private key in there somewhere
 

1251
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,310
private key in there somewhere
but what i'm doing is i'm trying to use

1252
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
but what i'm doing is i'm trying to use
 

1253
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,510
but what i'm doing is i'm trying to use
the private key

1254
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
the private key
 

1255
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,950
the private key
to verify the identity of the person or

1256
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
to verify the identity of the person or
 

1257
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,990
to verify the identity of the person or
the the

1258
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
the the
 

1259
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,590
the the
you know the person who's connecting to

1260
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
you know the person who's connecting to
 

1261
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,870
you know the person who's connecting to
the uh to the server

1262
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
the uh to the server
 

1263
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,390
the uh to the server
and it seems to me ssl won't do that ssl

1264
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
and it seems to me ssl won't do that ssl
 

1265
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,470
and it seems to me ssl won't do that ssl
will encrypt the communication between

1266
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
will encrypt the communication between
 

1267
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,470
will encrypt the communication between
the client and the server

1268
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
the client and the server
 

1269
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,269
the client and the server
but i don't think that is an adequate

1270
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
but i don't think that is an adequate
 

1271
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:53,750
but i don't think that is an adequate
way

1272
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
way
 

1273
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,269
way
to verify a person's identity

1274
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
to verify a person's identity
 

1275
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,070
to verify a person's identity
i think the the the solution is public

1276
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,080
i think the the the solution is public
 

1277
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,950
i think the the the solution is public
private key

1278
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
private key
 

1279
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,190
private key
but i'm i'm looking at the gcrypt

1280
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
but i'm i'm looking at the gcrypt
 

1281
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,269
but i'm i'm looking at the gcrypt
library at the moment that comes on

1282
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
library at the moment that comes on
 

1283
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,590
library at the moment that comes on
um that comes standard with linux and i

1284
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
um that comes standard with linux and i
 

1285
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,630
um that comes standard with linux and i
think i figured out how to do it but um

1286
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:12,640
think i figured out how to do it but um
 

1287
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,070
think i figured out how to do it but um
i'm trying to understand as i say i'm

1288
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
i'm trying to understand as i say i'm
 

1289
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,350
i'm trying to understand as i say i'm
trying to understand the difference

1290
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
trying to understand the difference
 

1291
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,669
trying to understand the difference
between public and private key

1292
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
between public and private key
 

1293
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,710
between public and private key
and ssl i always thought that

1294
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
and ssl i always thought that
 

1295
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,230
and ssl i always thought that
ssl was just point to point encryption

1296
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240

 

1297
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,590

i think that's true as well

1298
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
i think that's true as well
 

1299
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,230
i think that's true as well
but it seems to rely on some kind of a

1300
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
but it seems to rely on some kind of a
 

1301
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,510
but it seems to rely on some kind of a
third party to

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
third party to
 

1303
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,830

and i'm i'm i'm trying to come up with a
 

1309
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:40,710
and i'm i'm i'm trying to come up with a
solution

1310
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
solution
 

1311
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,310
solution
trust no one right if i if i generate a

1312
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
trust no one right if i if i generate a
 

1313
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,710
trust no one right if i if i generate a
private key as my client

1314
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
private key as my client
 

1315
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,950
private key as my client
uh at me running the client when i talk

1316
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
uh at me running the client when i talk
 

1317
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,630
uh at me running the client when i talk
to the server i want to give the server

1318
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
to the server i want to give the server
 

1319
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,990
to the server i want to give the server
my public key

1320
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
my public key
 

1321
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,110
my public key
say right here's my public key and

1322
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
say right here's my public key and
 

1323
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,149
say right here's my public key and
um and use that

1324
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
um and use that
 

1325
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,350
um and use that
anytime you want to talk to me um

1326
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
anytime you want to talk to me um
 

1327

anytime you want to talk to me um
but the the thing when i'm reading

1328
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
but the the thing when i'm reading
 

1329
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,029
but the the thing when i'm reading
through the documentation is it looks

1330
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,039
through the documentation is it looks
 

1331
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,070
through the documentation is it looks
like you can only

1332
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
like you can only
 

1333
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,390
like you can only
encrypt with a private key and i'm not

1334
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,400
encrypt with a private key and i'm not
 

1335
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,750
encrypt with a private key and i'm not
going to give the server

1336
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:09,760
going to give the server
 

1337
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,029
going to give the server
my private key so that's that's your

1338
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
my private key so that's that's your
 

1339
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,549
my private key so that's that's your
homework for the uh

into it i just got into it deep enough
 

1389
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,029
into it i just got into it deep enough
to be able to compile the package that i

1390
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
to be able to compile the package that i
 

1391
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,430
to be able to compile the package that i
was

1392
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
was
 

1393
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,269
was
trying to compile the latest version of

00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
trying to compile the latest version of
 

1395
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,950
trying to compile the latest version of

1396
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960
and it just compiled and ran
 

1397
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,630
and it just compiled and ran
so there's a fold called

1398
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:12,640
so there's a fold called
 

1399
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,990
so there's a fold called
uh there's a following windows which you

1400
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
uh there's a following windows which you
 

1401
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,549
uh there's a following windows which you
you run with the program i've got a

1402
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
you run with the program i've got a
 

1403
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,830
you run with the program i've got a
script folder i'll run

1404
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
script folder i'll run
 

1405
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,909
script folder i'll run
and uh it takes off all this package

1406
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919
and uh it takes off all this package
 

1407
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,870
and uh it takes off all this package
level

1408
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
level
 

1409
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,269
level
and it makes it nice and slim i don't

1410
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
and it makes it nice and slim i don't
 

1411
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,789
and it makes it nice and slim i don't
know if you have to do that then

1412
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
know if you have to do that then
 

1413
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,389
know if you have to do that then
yeah i'm not doing this i'm not doing

yeah i'm not doing this i'm not doing
 

1415
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,230
yeah i'm not doing this i'm not doing
this to distribute it so i do not care

1416
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
this to distribute it so i do not care
 

1417
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,909
this to distribute it so i do not care
whether it has debug symbols in it or

1418
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
whether it has debug symbols in it or
 

1419
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,190
whether it has debug symbols in it or
any of that mess

1420

1423
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,470
so i'm quite happy just to uh just to
run it

1424
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
run it
 

1425
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,310
run it
as it comes out of the compiler because

1426
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
as it comes out of the compiler because
 

1427
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,389
as it comes out of the compiler because
i'm writing a program to that

1428
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
i'm writing a program to that
 

1429
