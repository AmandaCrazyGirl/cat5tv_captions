below us but he's not at his chair right
 

19
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,029
below us but he's not at his chair right
now

20
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
now
 

21
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,630
now
doug was trying to get in a while ago

22
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
doug was trying to get in a while ago
 

23
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,950
doug was trying to get in a while ago
and uh and he's um

24
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
and uh and he's um
 

25
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,710
and uh and he's um
having audio issues so hopefully he'll

26
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
having audio issues so hopefully he'll
 

27
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,230
having audio issues so hopefully he'll
be able to come in and say hello

28
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
be able to come in and say hello
 

29
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,710
be able to come in and say hello
real quick as well here's peter all

30
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
real quick as well here's peter all
 

31
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,669
real quick as well here's peter all
right then so

32
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
right then so
 

33
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,310
right then so
um a couple of things uh if you watched

34
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
um a couple of things uh if you watched
 

35
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,750
um a couple of things uh if you watched
last week's coffee break

36
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
last week's coffee break
 

37
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,310
last week's coffee break
i was trying to figure out

38
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320

 

39
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,430

how to do encrypted communications

40
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
how to do encrypted communications
 

41
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,270
how to do encrypted communications
and i was having some having some fun

42
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
and i was having some having some fun
 

43
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,630
and i was having some having some fun
with that um

44
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
with that um
 

45
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,310
with that um
and so what i i'm using gcrypt is

46
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
and so what i i'm using gcrypt is
 

47
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,510
and so what i i'm using gcrypt is
is the library that i'm using and what

48
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
is the library that i'm using and what
 

49
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,630
is the library that i'm using and what
i've figured out

50
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
i've figured out
 

51
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,069
i've figured out
i believe is that i need two public

52
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
i believe is that i need two public
 

53
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,950
i believe is that i need two public
private key sets i need one for the

54
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
private key sets i need one for the
 

55
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,229
private key sets i need one for the
server

56
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
server
 

57
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,509
server
and and i need one for

58
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
and and i need one for
 

59
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,109
and and i need one for
um one for the client

60
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
um one for the client
 

61
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,350
um one for the client
so the server has a public private key

62
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
so the server has a public private key
 

63
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,990
so the server has a public private key
and the client has a public private key

64
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
and the client has a public private key
 

65
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,350
and the client has a public private key
and the idea there

66
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
and the idea there
 

67
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,600
and the idea there
is that the um

68
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:19,610
is that the um
 

69
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,710
is that the um

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,910

is you always encrypt

72
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
is you always encrypt
 

73
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,190
is you always encrypt
i believe with the public key and you

74
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
i believe with the public key and you
 

75
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,310
i believe with the public key and you
decrypt with the private key and so the

76
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
decrypt with the private key and so the
 

77
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,550
decrypt with the private key and so the
whole point of this is to figure out

78
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
whole point of this is to figure out
 

79
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,630
whole point of this is to figure out
is so the server can figure out without

80
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
is so the server can figure out without
 

81
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,469
is so the server can figure out without
any question who

82
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
any question who
 

83
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,749
any question who
the client is the identity of the client

84
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
the client is the identity of the client
 

85
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,630
the client is the identity of the client
ssl won't do this ssl at least to my

86
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
ssl won't do this ssl at least to my
 

87
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,190
ssl won't do this ssl at least to my
knowledge

88
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
knowledge
 

89
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,069
knowledge
ssl will encrypt the communications but

90
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
ssl will encrypt the communications but
 

91
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,230
ssl will encrypt the communications but
i don't think you can use that

92
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
i don't think you can use that
 

93
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,190
i don't think you can use that
to uh uh to verify who the person is

94
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
to uh uh to verify who the person is
 

95
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,950
to uh uh to verify who the person is
now sober if you know anything about

00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
now sober if you know anything about
 

97
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,469
now sober if you know anything about
that i'd be happy to

98
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
that i'd be happy to
 

99
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,310
that i'd be happy to
to chat about that with you yeah and uh

100
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
to chat about that with you yeah and uh
 

101
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,830
to chat about that with you yeah and uh
ssl

102
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
ssl
 

103
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,149
ssl
is not a thing to use um

104
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159

 

105
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,149

traffic just fine but it doesn't very

106
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
traffic just fine but it doesn't very
 

107
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,550
traffic just fine but it doesn't very
very um yeah that was my thought as well

108
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
very um yeah that was my thought as well
 

109
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,869
very um yeah that was my thought as well
from

110
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
from
 

111
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,350
from
everything i could read about ssl versus

112
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
everything i could read about ssl versus
 

113
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,430
everything i could read about ssl versus
public private key encryption

114
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
public private key encryption
 

115
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,350
public private key encryption
your background's bleeding through there

116
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
your background's bleeding through there
 

117
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,980
your background's bleeding through there
so yeah

118
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:15,990
so yeah
 

119
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,550
so yeah
[Laughter]

120
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560

 

121
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,309

you're transporting away somewhere is

122
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
you're transporting away somewhere is
 

123
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,110
you're transporting away somewhere is
what's going on

124
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120

 

125
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,229

so yeah i've also had i've been working

126
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
so yeah i've also had i've been working
 

127
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,790
so yeah i've also had i've been working
on a project that requires a raspberry

128
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
on a project that requires a raspberry
 

129
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,670
on a project that requires a raspberry
pi to be on the internet all the time

130
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
pi to be on the internet all the time
 

131
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,710
pi to be on the internet all the time
and uh one of the things that uh that i

132
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
and uh one of the things that uh that i
 

133
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,110
and uh one of the things that uh that i
arranged with my um uh with my

134
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
arranged with my um uh with my
 

135
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,830
arranged with my um uh with my
internet provider is to get a static ip

136
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
internet provider is to get a static ip
 

137
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,509
internet provider is to get a static ip
address well they gave me a block of

138
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
address well they gave me a block of
 

139
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,470
address well they gave me a block of
five of them

140
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
five of them
 

141
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,270
five of them
which was very nice of them because i

142
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
which was very nice of them because i
 

143
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,030
which was very nice of them because i
want to put this raspberry pi

144
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
want to put this raspberry pi
 

145
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,750
want to put this raspberry pi
on the internet but i do not want it to

146
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
on the internet but i do not want it to
 

147
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,869
on the internet but i do not want it to
have any access to

148
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
have any access to
 

149
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,309
have any access to
my internal network so the quickest way

150
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
my internal network so the quickest way
 

151
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,110
my internal network so the quickest way
that i could think to do that was to

152
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
that i could think to do that was to
 

153
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,670
that i could think to do that was to
put up another router plug it up onto my

154
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
put up another router plug it up onto my
 

155
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,869
put up another router plug it up onto my
internet modem

156
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
internet modem
 

157
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,030
internet modem
and give it the second address a second

158
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
and give it the second address a second
 

159
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,949
and give it the second address a second
static address in the range

160
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
static address in the range
 

161
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,270
static address in the range
it just comes up on the internet now and

162
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
it just comes up on the internet now and
 

163
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,229
it just comes up on the internet now and
then it just

164
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
then it just
 

165
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,270
then it just
it just works so um i

166
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
it just works so um i
 

167
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,630
it just works so um i
so the raspberry pi is on the internet

168
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
so the raspberry pi is on the internet
 

169
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,670
so the raspberry pi is on the internet
but it doesn't

170
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
but it doesn't
 

171
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,030
but it doesn't
uh uh it does not have any access to my

172
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
uh uh it does not have any access to my
 

173
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,390
uh uh it does not have any access to my
internal network

174
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
internal network
 

175
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,550
internal network
which is a quick and easy way to do it

176
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
which is a quick and easy way to do it
 

177
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,229
which is a quick and easy way to do it
not everybody has the luxury of being

178
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
not everybody has the luxury of being
 

179
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,229
not everybody has the luxury of being
able to say i want a static ip address

180
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
able to say i want a static ip address
 

181
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,190
able to say i want a static ip address
please

182
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
please
 

183
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,910
please
but um i i was able to do that and that

but um i i was able to do that and that
 

185
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,990
but um i i was able to do that and that
worked out really well for me

186
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
worked out really well for me
 

187
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,270
worked out really well for me
yeah um

188
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280

 

189
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,910

i think yeah i have a static ip and i'm

190
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
i think yeah i have a static ip and i'm
 

191
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,550
i think yeah i have a static ip and i'm
i'm

192
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
i'm
 

193
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,509
i'm
paying for it oh yeah oh yeah this is

194
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
paying for it oh yeah oh yeah this is
 

195
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,509
paying for it oh yeah oh yeah this is
not free

196
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
not free
 

197
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,110
not free
this is not free but you know it works

198
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
this is not free but you know it works
 

199
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,750
this is not free but you know it works
um have you ever seen i don't know if

200
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
um have you ever seen i don't know if
 

201
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,550
um have you ever seen i don't know if
dells

202
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
dells
 

203
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,429
dells
are the only machines that do this but i

204
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
are the only machines that do this but i
 

205
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,789
are the only machines that do this but i
had a reason to

206
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
had a reason to
 

207
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,149
had a reason to
spin up windows 10 on my

208
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
spin up windows 10 on my
 

209
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,509
spin up windows 10 on my
main machine again and

210
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
main machine again and
 

211
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,710
main machine again and
yeah i know i know it came with the

212
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
yeah i know i know it came with the
 

213
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,350
yeah i know i know it came with the
machine

214
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
machine
 

215
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,830
machine
on its own uh hard drive

216
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
on its own uh hard drive
 

217
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,910
on its own uh hard drive
so so i

218
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
so so i
 

219
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,469
so so i
i was looking at the possibility of dual

220
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
i was looking at the possibility of dual
 

221
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,550
i was looking at the possibility of dual
booting linux and windows 10

222
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
booting linux and windows 10
 

223
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,710
booting linux and windows 10
but windows 10 has like half a dozen

224
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
but windows 10 has like half a dozen
 

225
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,990
but windows 10 has like half a dozen
partitions

226
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
partitions
 

227
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,830
partitions
and the main partitions in the middle of

228
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
and the main partitions in the middle of
 

229
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,230
and the main partitions in the middle of
the block so it's kind of crazy

230
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
the block so it's kind of crazy
 

231
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,510
the block so it's kind of crazy
because you you try to uh make the

232
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
because you you try to uh make the
 

233
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,350
because you you try to uh make the
connection work and it doesn't

234
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
connection work and it doesn't
 

235
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,950
connection work and it doesn't
always it doesn't i decided not to do it

236
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
always it doesn't i decided not to do it
 

237
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,950
always it doesn't i decided not to do it
that way anyway it turns out that when

238
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
that way anyway it turns out that when
 

239
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,030
that way anyway it turns out that when
the dell machine cranks up

240
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
the dell machine cranks up
 

241
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,270
the dell machine cranks up
when it goes through post there's a pf

242
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
when it goes through post there's a pf
 

243
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,430
when it goes through post there's a pf
key 12 that you can use

244
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
key 12 that you can use
 

245
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,310
key 12 that you can use
to um to select which hard drive you

246
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
to um to select which hard drive you
 

247
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,430
to um to select which hard drive you
want to boot off

248
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
want to boot off
 

249
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,670
want to boot off
and you get your boot facility without

250
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
and you get your boot facility without
 

251
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,030
and you get your boot facility without
having to

252
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
having to
 

253
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,510
having to
install linux and windows on the same

254
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
install linux and windows on the same
 

255
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,710
install linux and windows on the same
hard drive

256
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
hard drive
 

257
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,270
hard drive
so that worked out really well so now i

258
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
so that worked out really well so now i
 

259
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,029
so that worked out really well so now i
have two hard drives spinning up

260
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
have two hard drives spinning up
 

261
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,310
have two hard drives spinning up
in the in the main machine and i get to

262
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
in the in the main machine and i get to
 

263
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,150
in the in the main machine and i get to
pick which one i want linux or windows

264
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
pick which one i want linux or windows
 

265
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,510
pick which one i want linux or windows
10 and it works

266
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
10 and it works
 

267
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,590
10 and it works
by default it'll pick window uh by

268
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
by default it'll pick window uh by
 

269
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,270
by default it'll pick window uh by
default it'll pick linux

270
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
default it'll pick linux
 

271
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,029
default it'll pick linux
21 years ago i did the dual booting um

272
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
21 years ago i did the dual booting um
 

273
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,670
21 years ago i did the dual booting um
and my experience is that i know it's

274
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
and my experience is that i know it's
 

275
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,150
and my experience is that i know it's
changed

276
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
changed
 

277
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,510
changed
in the last 20 years but still um

278
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
in the last 20 years but still um
 

279
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,350
in the last 20 years but still um
i have bad experience in the dual

280
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
i have bad experience in the dual
 

281
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,189
i have bad experience in the dual
booting so my recommendation

282
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
booting so my recommendation
 

283
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,469
booting so my recommendation
for those who is able to do it is

284
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
for those who is able to do it is
 

285
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,950
for those who is able to do it is
if you want to have the two systems in

286
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
if you want to have the two systems in
 

287
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,990
if you want to have the two systems in
the same

288
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
the same
 

289
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,469
the same
system have them on a separate physical

290
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
system have them on a separate physical
 

291
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,670
system have them on a separate physical
hard drive

292
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
hard drive
 

293
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,870
hard drive
to separate them so

294
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
to separate them so
 

295
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,029
to separate them so
and that's exactly what i did but i

296
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
and that's exactly what i did but i
 

297
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,990
and that's exactly what i did but i
don't know if

298
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
don't know if
 

299
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,510
don't know if
every machine is able to select which

300
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
every machine is able to select which
 

301
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,430
every machine is able to select which
hard drive to boot on

302
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
hard drive to boot on
 

303
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,390
hard drive to boot on
when it starts up i found i figured out

304
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
when it starts up i found i figured out
 

305
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,150
when it starts up i found i figured out
the dell can do it but i don't know if

306
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
the dell can do it but i don't know if
 

307
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,909
the dell can do it but i don't know if
that's specific to dell or if

308
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
that's specific to dell or if
 

309
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,110
that's specific to dell or if
any machine can do that it's got to be

310
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
any machine can do that it's got to be
 

311
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,990
any machine can do that it's got to be
something built in the bios right

312
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
something built in the bios right
 

313
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,749
something built in the bios right
yeah drill biting has nothing to do with

314
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
yeah drill biting has nothing to do with
 

315
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,990
yeah drill biting has nothing to do with
the bios

316
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
the bios
 

317
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,150
the bios
the reason that people often have to go

318
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
the reason that people often have to go
 

319
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,550
the reason that people often have to go
to into the bios these days is to

320
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
to into the bios these days is to
 

321
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,270
to into the bios these days is to
turn off as a security in order to build

322
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
turn off as a security in order to build
 

323
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,430
turn off as a security in order to build
something else than their

324
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
something else than their
 

325
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,550
something else than their
windows or ubuntu who have

326
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
windows or ubuntu who have
 

327
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,150
windows or ubuntu who have
their have assigned

328
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
their have assigned
 

329
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,710
their have assigned
kernel drivers and yeah

330
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,990

dhcp clients and then told them to

500
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
dhcp clients and then told them to
 

501
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,430
dhcp clients and then told them to
if they need to change the config file

502
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
if they need to change the config file
 

503
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,470
if they need to change the config file
send it to the

504
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480

 

505
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,710

diamond that you just installed and then

506
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
diamond that you just installed and then
 

507
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,750
diamond that you just installed and then
you tell the doctor

to not do anything so okay
 

511
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,590
to not do anything so okay
okay so what that what that means to me

512
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
okay so what that what that means to me
 

513
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,030
okay so what that what that means to me
is that from now on even if i connect to

514
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
is that from now on even if i connect to
 

515
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,990
is that from now on even if i connect to
a

516
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
a
 

517
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,790
a
wireless network or something like that

518
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
wireless network or something like that
 

519
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,550
wireless network or something like that
um

520
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
um
 

521
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,030
um
i just gotta uh mute you there

522
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
i just gotta uh mute you there
 

523
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,590
i just gotta uh mute you there
i can figure out how to do that up there

524
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
i can figure out how to do that up there
 

525
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,870
i can figure out how to do that up there
it is okay

526
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
it is okay
 

527
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,150
it is okay
um what happened

528
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
um what happened
 

529
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,509
um what happened
there was um if i ever connect to a

530
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
there was um if i ever connect to a
 

531
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,990
there was um if i ever connect to a
network that's not my home network

532
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
network that's not my home network
 

533
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,949
network that's not my home network
then um i have to manually fix

534
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:57,959
then um i have to manually fix
 

535
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,590
then um i have to manually fix
resolve.conf because

536
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
resolve.conf because
 

537
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,750
resolve.conf because
from all the reading that i could do it

538
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
from all the reading that i could do it
 

539
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,790
from all the reading that i could do it
sounded like

540
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
sounded like
 

541
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,790
sounded like
the network manager it dynamically

542
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
the network manager it dynamically
 

543
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,030
the network manager it dynamically
changes that resolve.com depending on

544
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
changes that resolve.com depending on
 

545
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,870
changes that resolve.com depending on
what network you plug into

546
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
what network you plug into
 

547
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,190
what network you plug into
and normally that would be fine except

548
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
and normally that would be fine except
 

549
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,069
and normally that would be fine except
that the

550
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
that the
 

551
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,190
that the
ip address the 127.0.0.53

552
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
ip address the 127.0.0.53
 

553
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,110
ip address the 127.0.0.53
which is not the loopback address by the

554
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
which is not the loopback address by the
 

555
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,790
which is not the loopback address by the
way because the loopback address is

556
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:23,800
way because the loopback address is
 

557
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,750
way because the loopback address is
27.0.0.1

558
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
27.0.0.1
 

559
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,150
27.0.0.1
but the local dns address

560
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,160

 

561
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,030

127.0.0.53

562
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
127.0.0.53
 

563
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,350
127.0.0.53
seems to be the local address for the

564
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
seems to be the local address for the
 

565
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,269
seems to be the local address for the
network manager and then it just figures

566
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
network manager and then it just figures
 

567
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,710
network manager and then it just figures
out what to do from there

568
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
out what to do from there
 

569
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,150
out what to do from there
but whenever i fire up net about to say

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,470
uh it just um it always
introduces a delay whenever that was uh

580
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480

is going on um do you have any idea why
 

585
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,069
is going on um do you have any idea why
that delay because i can't imagine

586

that delay because i can't imagine
 

587
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,069
that delay because i can't imagine
why it should delay i would imagine it

588
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
why it should delay i would imagine it
 

589
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,190
why it should delay i would imagine it
would just

590
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
would just
 

591
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,509
would just
immediately switch to whatever the um uh

that person's name
 

839
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,950
that person's name
so what does this box do

840
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960

 

841
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,669

the synology box is a network storage

842
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
the synology box is a network storage
 

843
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,310
the synology box is a network storage
device

844
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
device
 

845
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,549
device
network attached storage but it does a

846
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
network attached storage but it does a
 

847
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,310
network attached storage but it does a
whole lot more than just that

848
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
whole lot more than just that
 

849
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,990
whole lot more than just that
right qnap also is a is a nas

850
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
right qnap also is a is a nas
 

851
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,830
right qnap also is a is a nas
but the synology um has a whole bunch of

852
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
but the synology um has a whole bunch of
 

853
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,990
but the synology um has a whole bunch of
applications that come with it

854
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
applications that come with it
 

855
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,830
applications that come with it
and one of those is an application

856
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
and one of those is an application
 

857
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,029
and one of those is an application
called moments

858
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
called moments
 

859
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,310
called moments
it's all local storage you're not

860
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
it's all local storage you're not
 

861
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,390
it's all local storage you're not
you're not putting anything on the net

862
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
you're not putting anything on the net
 

863
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,830
you're not putting anything on the net
and it's not having to go

864
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
and it's not having to go
 

865
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,870
and it's not having to go
to the internet to perform this function

866
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
to the internet to perform this function
 

867
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,789
to the internet to perform this function
for that reason it takes a while but

868
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
for that reason it takes a while but
 

869
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,230
for that reason it takes a while but
it's all done locally to my

870
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
it's all done locally to my
 

871
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,270
it's all done locally to my
understanding

872
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
understanding
 

873
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,390
understanding
so that's that to me is what sold it for

874
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
so that's that to me is what sold it for
 

875
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,310
so that's that to me is what sold it for
me it does not go off

876
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
me it does not go off
 

877
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,630
me it does not go off
it does not go off to to the internet to

878
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
it does not go off to to the internet to
 

879
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,710
it does not go off to to the internet to
go and do its thing so i was very

to do that for me
i can understand that when we scanned

946
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
i can understand that when we scanned
 

947
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,830
i can understand that when we scanned
negatives at the store we used to have a

948
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
negatives at the store we used to have a
 

949
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,070
negatives at the store we used to have a
motorized scanner you'd feed it into a

950
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
motorized scanner you'd feed it into a
 

951
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,190
motorized scanner you'd feed it into a
track

952
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
track
 

953
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,350
track
and then hit a button and it would go to

and then hit a button and it would go to
 

955
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,789
and then hit a button and it would go to
the first frame

956
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
the first frame
 

957
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,870
the first frame
you'd hit uh a button and it would

958
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
you'd hit uh a button and it would
 

959
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,230
you'd hit uh a button and it would
capture it

960
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
capture it
 

961
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,390
capture it
no and then hit a button it would move

962
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
no and then hit a button it would move
 

963
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,350
no and then hit a button it would move
to the next frame and then capture that

964
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
to the next frame and then capture that
 

965
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,270
to the next frame and then capture that
