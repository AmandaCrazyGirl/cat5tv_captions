uh sockets in in the um
 

249
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,390
uh sockets in in the um
uh in the back of the unit that allow

250
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
uh in the back of the unit that allow
 

251
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,310
uh in the back of the unit that allow
you to plug in what's called an option

and what i put in its place is a device
 

257
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,350
and what i put in its place is a device
that replaces all of the memory in this

258
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
that replaces all of the memory in this
 

259
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,469
that replaces all of the memory in this
thing

260

thing
 

261
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,430
thing
um because as delivered this thing has

262
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
um because as delivered this thing has
 

263
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,469
um because as delivered this thing has
32k

264
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
32k
 

265
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,629
32k
of 32k of rom and 32k of ram i'm gonna

266
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
of 32k of rom and 32k of ram i'm gonna
 

267
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,270
of 32k of rom and 32k of ram i'm gonna
say

268
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
say
 

269
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,710
say
all of the memory oh 32k

270
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
all of the memory oh 32k
 

271
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,990
all of the memory oh 32k
all of the 32k yes

272
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
all of the 32k yes
 

273
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,029
all of the 32k yes
so it lets you replace

274

and give you 64k
 

281
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,070
and give you 64k
of memory and then it um

282
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
of memory and then it um
 

283
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,270
of memory and then it um
and then it's uh

284
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
and then it's uh
 

285
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,350
and then it's uh
also has enough space on that dinky

286
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
also has enough space on that dinky
 

287
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,550
also has enough space on that dinky
little device

288

little device
 

289
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,909
little device
for a four megabyte hard drive

290
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
for a four megabyte hard drive
 

291
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,350

00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
successful so you end up having to just
 

409
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,509
successful so you end up having to just
type the whole page in anyway by the

410
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
type the whole page in anyway by the
 

411
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,509
type the whole page in anyway by the
time you get around to

all torn apart drives everywhere

708
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
all torn apart drives everywhere
 

709
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,189
all torn apart drives everywhere
oh so i'm pulling all the i'm pulling

710
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
oh so i'm pulling all the i'm pulling
 

711
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,590
oh so i'm pulling all the i'm pulling
all the drives running fio test

712
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
all the drives running fio test
 

713
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,870
all the drives running fio test
gotta run some tests and then i've got

714
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
gotta run some tests and then i've got
 

715
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,310
gotta run some tests and then i've got
ssd's data center drive to put in there

716
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
ssd's data center drive to put in there
 

717
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,990
ssd's data center drive to put in there
so you're going to see some nice

718
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
so you're going to see some nice
 

719
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,230
so you're going to see some nice
improvement in performance right there

720
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
improvement in performance right there
 

721
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,670
improvement in performance right there
a little bit of a performance

722
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
a little bit of a performance
 

723
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,629
a little bit of a performance
improvement yes

724
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639

 

725
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,150

lucky nice now you do know how to use

726
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
lucky nice now you do know how to use
 

727
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,350
lucky nice now you do know how to use
dvd in linux

728
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
dvd in linux
 

729
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,430
dvd in linux
you you do know how to use db in linux

730
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
you you do know how to use db in linux
 

731
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,629
you you do know how to use db in linux
right

732
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
right
 

733
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,269
right
well yes what do i need that for my

734
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
well yes what do i need that for my
 

735
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,069
well yes what do i need that for my
transfer

736
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
transfer
 

737
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,509
transfer
to transfer all the data from the

738
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
to transfer all the data from the
 

739
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,829
to transfer all the data from the
spinning drive to that

740
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
spinning drive to that
 

741
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,629
spinning drive to that
no no i don't need to do that um because

742
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
no no i don't need to do that um because
 

743
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:56,949
no no i don't need to do that um because
i've

744
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
i've
 

745
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,030
i've
uh i came in i've spent the last three

746
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
uh i came in i've spent the last three
 

747
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,350
uh i came in i've spent the last three
days running redundant backups

748
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
days running redundant backups
 

749
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,590
days running redundant backups
so i've got full images of the entire

750
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
so i've got full images of the entire
 

751
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,829
so i've got full images of the entire
system on separate drives

752
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
system on separate drives
 

753
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,310
system on separate drives
um

754
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320

 

755
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,030

it's at 96 doing an offline rebuild

756
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
it's at 96 doing an offline rebuild
 

757
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,829
it's at 96 doing an offline rebuild
right now

758
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
right now
 

759
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,949
right now
so um so while i'm running fio tests to

760
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
so um so while i'm running fio tests to
 

761
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,509
so um so while i'm running fio tests to
get the

762
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
get the
 

763
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,710
get the
benchmarks um so i'm benchmarking the

764
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
benchmarks um so i'm benchmarking the
 

765
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,949
benchmarks um so i'm benchmarking the
spinning drive and then once i upgrade

766
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
spinning drive and then once i upgrade
 

767
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,629
spinning drive and then once i upgrade
to the ssds i'm going to be benchmarking

768
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
to the ssds i'm going to be benchmarking
 

769
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,910
to the ssds i'm going to be benchmarking
those to see what the difference in

770
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
those to see what the difference in
 

771
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,949
those to see what the difference in
performance is

772
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
performance is
 

773
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,949
performance is
and i got um

774
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
and i got um
 

775
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,230
and i got um
one of these like decibel indicators

776
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
one of these like decibel indicators
 

777
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,389
one of these like decibel indicators
that show you the ambient noise

778
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
that show you the ambient noise
 

779
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,389
that show you the ambient noise
nice so i i actually took a reading

780
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
nice so i i actually took a reading
 

781
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,430
nice so i i actually took a reading
before

782
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
before
 

783
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,189
before
so i took a reading before so that i

784
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
so i took a reading before so that i
 

785
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,389
so i took a reading before so that i
could hear because you know that i've

786
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
could hear because you know that i've
 

787
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,910
could hear because you know that i've
been trying to cut down on the noise in

788
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
been trying to cut down on the noise in
 

789
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,710
been trying to cut down on the noise in
the studio

790
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
the studio
 

791
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,590
the studio
or in the on the bridge but i'm curious

792
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
or in the on the bridge but i'm curious
 

793
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,550
or in the on the bridge but i'm curious
to know

794
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
to know
 

795
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,629
to know
if getting spinning drives out of the

796
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
if getting spinning drives out of the
 

797
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,949
if getting spinning drives out of the
server because there's six of them right

798
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
server because there's six of them right
 

799
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,269
server because there's six of them right
if that's going to make a difference um

800
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
if that's going to make a difference um
 

801
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,110
if that's going to make a difference um
on noise because spinning drives do

802
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
on noise because spinning drives do
 

803
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,430
on noise because spinning drives do
generate a little bit of motor noise

804
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440

 

805
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,189

it should be should make a little bit of

806
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
it should be should make a little bit of
 

807
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,710
it should be should make a little bit of
a difference eh yeah

808
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
a difference eh yeah
 

809
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,669
a difference eh yeah
right oh absolutely that's what i meant

810
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
right oh absolutely that's what i meant
 

811
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,189
right oh absolutely that's what i meant
today guys

812
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
today guys
 

813
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,390
today guys

in the
 

821
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,270
in the
in the previous coffee break had two

822
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
in the previous coffee break had two
 

823
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,630
in the previous coffee break had two
floppy drives in it

824
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
floppy drives in it
 

825
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,150
floppy drives in it
and they generate a huge amount of noise

826
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
and they generate a huge amount of noise
 

827
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,430
and they generate a huge amount of noise
exactly and i pulled those out

828
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
exactly and i pulled those out
 

829
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,750
exactly and i pulled those out
and put in an sd card reader in in their

830
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
and put in an sd card reader in in their
 

831
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,870
and put in an sd card reader in in their
place to emulate

832
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
place to emulate
 

833
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,390

few with our pliers and and he mounted
 

865
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,230
few with our pliers and and he mounted
the

866
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
the
 

867
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,710
the
um standard uh silent desktop fans

868
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
um standard uh silent desktop fans
 

869
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,909
um standard uh silent desktop fans
and he connected those to the um and all

870
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
and he connected those to the um and all
 

871
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,630
and he connected those to the um and all
of a sudden

872
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
of a sudden
 

873
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,990
of a sudden
it went from very noisy to is it on

874
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
it went from very noisy to is it on
 

875
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,190
it went from very noisy to is it on
yeah yeah it is amazing that the amount

876
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
yeah yeah it is amazing that the amount
 

877
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,110
yeah yeah it is amazing that the amount
of noise these machines can make it's

878
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
of noise these machines can make it's
 

879
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,230
of noise these machines can make it's
quite surprising

880
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
quite surprising
 

881
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,430
quite surprising
and i guess you're right i guess they

882
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
and i guess you're right i guess they
 

883
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,110
and i guess you're right i guess they
don't care if it's a server a rack

884
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
don't care if it's a server a rack
 

885
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,549
don't care if it's a server a rack
mounted device

886
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
mounted device
 

887
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,150
mounted device
i guess they don't care too much about

888
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
i guess they don't care too much about
 

889
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,750
i guess they don't care too much about
noise but there must be all kinds of

890
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
noise but there must be all kinds of
 

891
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,590
noise but there must be all kinds of
noise in a data center as well yeah i

892
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
noise in a data center as well yeah i
 

893
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,630
noise in a data center as well yeah i
often wonder that

894
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
often wonder that
 

895
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,470
often wonder that
oh yeah like when i walk into the data

896
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
oh yeah like when i walk into the data
 

897
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,029
oh yeah like when i walk into the data
center where our server's co-located

898
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
center where our server's co-located
 

899
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,230
center where our server's co-located
um it's like you walk in and it's just

900
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240

 

901
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,950

nasty and i just wonder like why don't

902
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
nasty and i just wonder like why don't
 

903
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,510
nasty and i just wonder like why don't
dell

904
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
dell
 

905
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,310
dell
and the the big server companies why

906
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
and the the big server companies why
 

907
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,430
and the the big server companies why
don't they

908
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
don't they
 

909
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,830
don't they
reduce the noise like it makes sense

910
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
reduce the noise like it makes sense
 

911
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,430
reduce the noise like it makes sense
right like

912
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
right like
 

913
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,510
right like
they're not cheap fans that they put in

914
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
they're not cheap fans that they put in
 

915
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,950
they're not cheap fans that they put in
it like it's it's not like they're

916
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
it like it's it's not like they're
 

917
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,990
it like it's it's not like they're
cheaping out and going with

918
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
cheaping out and going with
 

919
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,110
cheaping out and going with
noisy fans like they could put silent

920
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
noisy fans like they could put silent
 

921
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,190
noisy fans like they could put silent
fans in their servers and it would take

922
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
fans in their servers and it would take
 

923
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,350
fans in their servers and it would take
the levels from here to here

924
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
the levels from here to here
 

925
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,830
the levels from here to here
yeah just to make it more pleasant and i

926
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
yeah just to make it more pleasant and i
 

927
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,909
yeah just to make it more pleasant and i
think

928
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
think
 

929
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,630
think
maybe we'll start to see more of that do

930
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
maybe we'll start to see more of that do
 

931
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,830
maybe we'll start to see more of that do
you think we'll start to see more of

932
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
you think we'll start to see more of
 

933
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,510
you think we'll start to see more of
that because uh we're gonna have so many

934
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
that because uh we're gonna have so many
 

935

system to
 

973
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,470
system to
a newer system that we bought from the

data center
 

977
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,830
data center
and we went to the data center and they

978

and we went to the data center and they
 

979
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,270
and we went to the data center and they
had it lying on a desk

980

had it lying on a desk
 

981
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,590
