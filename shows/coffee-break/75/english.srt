but what about virtual well virtualbox

164
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
but what about virtual well virtualbox
 

165
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,190
but what about virtual well virtualbox
is an option too peter that that's one

166
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
is an option too peter that that's one
 

167
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,710
is an option too peter that that's one
of my options as well and i can

168
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
of my options as well and i can
 

169
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,910
of my options as well and i can
certainly do that

170
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
certainly do that
 

171
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,550
certainly do that
i've got enough cpu and enough memory to

172
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
i've got enough cpu and enough memory to
 

173
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,149
i've got enough cpu and enough memory to
be able to do it as a virtual machine

174
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
be able to do it as a virtual machine
 

175
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,750
be able to do it as a virtual machine
but i wanted to try docker because i've

176
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
but i wanted to try docker because i've
 

177
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,350
but i wanted to try docker because i've
never tried it before

178
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
never tried it before
 

179
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,990
never tried it before
so i have no problem doing doing virtual

180
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
so i have no problem doing doing virtual
 

181
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,350
so i have no problem doing doing virtual
machine if i can

182
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
machine if i can
 

183
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,789
machine if i can
you know if i need to um but i will

184
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
you know if i need to um but i will
 

185
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,670
you know if i need to um but i will
i will try um i do want to have a good

186
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
i will try um i do want to have a good
 

187
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,710
i will try um i do want to have a good
docker first

so uh if anyone has used docker before

190
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
so uh if anyone has used docker before
 

191
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,390
so uh if anyone has used docker before
i'd be

uh test harness originally but all i
 

289
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,390
uh test harness originally but all i
could do is say

290
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
could do is say
 

291
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,550
could do is say
run all the tests i couldn't really

292
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
run all the tests i couldn't really
 

293
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,469
run all the tests i couldn't really
select which ones they were nor could i

brother who know a few things about this
 

565
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,030
brother who know a few things about this
here is that if you are changing um

566
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
here is that if you are changing um
 

567
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,269
here is that if you are changing um
from uh old-fashioned light bulbs and

568
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
from uh old-fashioned light bulbs and
 

569
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,590
from uh old-fashioned light bulbs and
and

571
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,550

fitting uh led lights you most likely

572
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
fitting uh led lights you most likely
 

573
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,430
fitting uh led lights you most likely
you most likely also need to change the

574
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
you most likely also need to change the
 

575
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,630
you most likely also need to change the
light the entire thing

576
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
light the entire thing
 

577
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,550
light the entire thing
because it's not uh calibrated to uh

578
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
because it's not uh calibrated to uh
 

579
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,069
because it's not uh calibrated to uh
led and it might um be too bright or

580
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
led and it might um be too bright or

um so it has only one um
 

621
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,310
um so it has only one um
thread and it's a different socket than

622
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
thread and it's a different socket than
 

623
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,910
thread and it's a different socket than
the usual

624
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
the usual
 

625
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,350
the usual
but mine is a minus in this unleash it's

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
but mine is a minus in this unleash it's
 

627
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,629
but mine is a minus in this unleash it's
a full 100

00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
a full 100
 

629
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,230
a full 100
electric car and it actually has leds

630
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
electric car and it actually has leds
 

631
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,790
electric car and it actually has leds
for the downward facing lights you know

632
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
for the downward facing lights you know
 

633
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,069
for the downward facing lights you know
for the lights that

634

then
 

639
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,110
then
incandescent lights for the high beams

640
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
incandescent lights for the high beams
 

641
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,990
incandescent lights for the high beams
and you it does a control in in at the

642
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
and you it does a control in in at the
 

643

driver's station at the driver's
 

645
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,430
driver's station at the driver's
location that you can actually twist and

646
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
location that you can actually twist and
 

647
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,990
location that you can actually twist and
knob

648
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
knob
 

649
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,990
knob
and it it brings the head beams it

650
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
and it it brings the head beams it
 

651
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,829
and it it brings the head beams it
brings the headlights down like that so

652
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
brings the headlights down like that so
 

653
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,829
brings the headlights down like that so
they don't shine into

654
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839
they don't shine into
 

655
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:14,069
they don't shine into
um

656

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,190
uh back to their recent uh
an argument against uh replacing their

666
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
an argument against uh replacing their
 

667
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,670
an argument against uh replacing their
bulb old-fashioned light bulbs with led

lights
 

671
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,550
lights
is that the led lights there doesn't

672
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
is that the led lights there doesn't
 

673
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,910
is that the led lights there doesn't
generate heat

674
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
generate heat
 

675
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,269
generate heat
and because i noticed in my led

676
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
and because i noticed in my led
 

677
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,389
and because i noticed in my led
extra head beams um when i use those

them in the airplane i've replaced all
 

721
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,629
them in the airplane i've replaced all
of my um incandescent lights in the

722
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
of my um incandescent lights in the
 

723
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,629
of my um incandescent lights in the
aeroplane with leds and it's wonderful

724
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
aeroplane with leds and it's wonderful
 

725
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,590
aeroplane with leds and it's wonderful
because

726
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
because
 

727
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,350
because
i still use a generator not an

728
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
i still use a generator not an
 

729
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,829
i still use a generator not an
alternator because it's that old like me

730
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
alternator because it's that old like me
 

731
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,269
alternator because it's that old like me
and and the uh

and and the uh
 

733
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,550
and and the uh
you hardly see the ammeter wobble

734
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
you hardly see the ammeter wobble
 

735
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,550
you hardly see the ammeter wobble
anymore when the um

736
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
anymore when the um
 

737
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,230
anymore when the um
uh uh when you turn the light i can have

738

the landing lights on and uh
 

741
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,350
the landing lights on and uh
and and the ammeter hardly even wavers

742
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
and and the ammeter hardly even wavers
 

743
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,750
and and the ammeter hardly even wavers
now

744
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
now
 

745
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,710
now
whereas with the old incandescent lights

746
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
whereas with the old incandescent lights
 

747
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,150
whereas with the old incandescent lights
it used to pull like 10 amps or

748
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
it used to pull like 10 amps or
 

749
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,590
it used to pull like 10 amps or
something i mean it was a

something i mean it was a
 

751
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,230
something i mean it was a
crazy thing right now the led lights

752
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
crazy thing right now the led lights
 

753
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,990
crazy thing right now the led lights
don't ice over

754
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000

 

755
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,110

uh well i don't fly in ice

but i thought even on a nice day if you
 

771
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,310
but i thought even on a nice day if you
got up high enough you'd get ice

772
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
got up high enough you'd get ice
 

773
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,069
got up high enough you'd get ice
no um well well you can if it's really

774
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
no um well well you can if it's really
 

775
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,790
no um well well you can if it's really
humid

776
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
humid
 

777
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,189
humid
outside and that's the thing and you

778
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
outside and that's the thing and you
 

779
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,550
outside and that's the thing and you
don't have to be in freezing

780
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
don't have to be in freezing
 

781
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,629
don't have to be in freezing
temperatures for that to happen

782
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
temperatures for that to happen
 

783
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,509
temperatures for that to happen
um it's the humidity because what can

784
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
um it's the humidity because what can
 

785
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:43,990
um it's the humidity because what can
happen

786
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
happen
 

787
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,590
happen
i've had carbice happen before in the um

788
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
i've had carbice happen before in the um
 

789
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,030
i've had carbice happen before in the um
in the airplane because when you're up

790
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
in the airplane because when you're up
 

791
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,749
in the airplane because when you're up
at nine and a half ten thousand feet

792
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
at nine and a half ten thousand feet
 

793
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,509
at nine and a half ten thousand feet
and it's still humid up there what will

794
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
and it's still humid up there what will
 

795
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,870
and it's still humid up there what will
happen is that

796
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
happen is that
 

797
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,150
happen is that
as air travels through the throat

798
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
as air travels through the throat
 

799
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,470
as air travels through the throat
of the carburetor what will happen is

800
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
of the carburetor what will happen is
 

801
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,509
of the carburetor what will happen is
ice will

802
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
ice will
 

803
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,550
ice will
will appear here and here and eventually

804
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
will appear here and here and eventually
 

805
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,670
will appear here and here and eventually
it will just sort of you know

806
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
it will just sort of you know
 

807
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,870
it will just sort of you know
go deeper and deeper and deeper close up

808
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
go deeper and deeper and deeper close up
 

809
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,069
go deeper and deeper and deeper close up
the throat it'll make the throat less

810
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
the throat it'll make the throat less
 

811
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,030
the throat it'll make the throat less
and less

812
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
and less
 

813
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,790
and less
you know um uh less air and

814
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
you know um uh less air and
 

815
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,910
you know um uh less air and
fuel mixture can get through and what

816
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
fuel mixture can get through and what
 

817
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,430
fuel mixture can get through and what
will happen is eventually the mixture

818
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
will happen is eventually the mixture
 

819
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,749
will happen is eventually the mixture
will

820
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
will
 

821
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,670
will
be messed up to the point where it just

822
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
be messed up to the point where it just
 

823
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,829
be messed up to the point where it just
can't run the engine anymore

824
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
can't run the engine anymore
 

825
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,790
can't run the engine anymore
um and so the engine will quit producing

826
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
um and so the engine will quit producing
 

827
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,870
um and so the engine will quit producing
power it never stopped turning

828
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
power it never stopped turning
 

829
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,870
power it never stopped turning
but um it uh it did uh uh

830
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
but um it uh it did uh uh
 

831
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,230
but um it uh it did uh uh
it did stop um generating power

832
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
it did stop um generating power
 

833
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,710
it did stop um generating power
so luckily i was right over the top of

834
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
so luckily i was right over the top of
 

835
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,350
so luckily i was right over the top of
another

836
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
another
 

837
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,189
another
over the top of an airport whose

838

over the top of an airport whose
 

839
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,870
over the top of an airport whose
controlled airspace didn't start till

like 5000 feet so

842
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
like 5000 feet so

i just started circling and then um
 

845
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,710
i just started circling and then um
in order to try and figure out the

846
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
in order to try and figure out the
 

847
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,470
in order to try and figure out the
problem before i called mayday

848

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,750
runs from the internet modem
to my my own internal router

1302
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
to my my own internal router
 

1303
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,990
to my my own internal router
which is the only thing that provides

1304
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,000
which is the only thing that provides
 

1305
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,029
which is the only thing that provides
the uh

1306
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
the uh
 

1307
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,070
the uh
that the the 2gig and the 5 gig wi-fi

1308
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
that the the 2gig and the 5 gig wi-fi
 

1309
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,190
that the the 2gig and the 5 gig wi-fi
so all that the internet company can see

1310
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
so all that the internet company can see
 

1311
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,029
so all that the internet company can see
is just my router

1312
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
is just my router
 

1313
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,909
is just my router
that's it and then i've got more routers

1314
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
that's it and then i've got more routers
 

1315
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,669
that's it and then i've got more routers
in the network

1316
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
in the network
 

1317
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,909
in the network
i've got more routers in the network to

1318
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
i've got more routers in the network to
 

1319
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,909
i've got more routers in the network to
spread out the load even further if i

1320
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
spread out the load even further if i
 

1321
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:52,390
spread out the load even further if i
need to

1322
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
need to
 

1323
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,070
need to
yeah yeah yeah but the the uh

1324
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
yeah yeah yeah but the the uh
 

1325
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,269
yeah yeah yeah but the the uh
i i also uh trying to tell them they

1326
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
i i also uh trying to tell them they
 

1327
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,909
i i also uh trying to tell them they
said can we use wi-fi i said no

1328
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919

1329
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,750
said can we use wi-fi i said no
because there's too many people next

1330
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
because there's too many people next
 

1331
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,510
because there's too many people next
over the road who said that's why my

1332
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
over the road who said that's why my
 

1333
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,230
over the road who said that's why my
door

1334
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
door
 

1335
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,190
door
tried to break in i've seen them do it

1336
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
tried to break in i've seen them do it
 

1337
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,230
tried to break in i've seen them do it
so why do it either

1338
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
so why do it either
 

1339
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,870
so why do it either
i put the radio on and i transmit and it

1340
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
i put the radio on and i transmit and it
 

1341
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,269
i put the radio on and i transmit and it
would

1342
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
would
 

1343
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,590
would
be scattered like no red bits especially

1344
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
be scattered like no red bits especially
 

1345
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,789
be scattered like no red bits especially
on on

1346
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:18,799
on on
 

1347
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,510
on on
30 meters okay so there's a couple ways

1348
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
30 meters okay so there's a couple ways
 

1349
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,029
30 meters okay so there's a couple ways
around that peter

1350
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
around that peter
 

1351
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,830
around that peter
you can actually you can actually make

1352
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
you can actually you can actually make
 

1353
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,310
you can actually you can actually make
it a

1354
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,320
it a
 

1355
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,590
it a
private wi-fi connection

1356
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
private wi-fi connection
 

1357
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,269
private wi-fi connection
you can make it not transmit the ssid

1358
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
you can make it not transmit the ssid
 

1359
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,750
you can make it not transmit the ssid
and in my case anyway and i guess your

1360
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
and in my case anyway and i guess your
 

1361
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,190
and in my case anyway and i guess your
modem can do it too

1362
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
modem can do it too
 

1363
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,789
modem can do it too
you can allow connections only from

1364
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:40,799
you can allow connections only from
 

1365
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,269
you can allow connections only from
network devices that you recognize and

1366
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
network devices that you recognize and
 

1367
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,789
network devices that you recognize and
that is my mac address

1368
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
that is my mac address
 

1369
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,590
that is my mac address
that will be done yeah uh uh but i also

1370
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
that will be done yeah uh uh but i also
 

1371
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,110
that will be done yeah uh uh but i also
do well then nobody should be able to

1372
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
do well then nobody should be able to
 

1373
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,830
do well then nobody should be able to
break in

1374
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840
break in
 

1375
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,029
break in
if they if they don't see your ssid no

1376
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039
if they if they don't see your ssid no
 

1377
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,669
if they if they don't see your ssid no
no they

1378
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
no they
 

1379
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,230
no they
but uh i i was trying to explain to them

1380
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
but uh i i was trying to explain to them
 

1381
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,350
but uh i i was trying to explain to them
that i don't

1382
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
that i don't
 

1383
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,990
that i don't
put it on and they don't think he didn't

1384
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000
put it on and they don't think he didn't
 

1385
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,070
put it on and they don't think he didn't
understand that i told him a number of

1386
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
understand that i told him a number of
 

1387
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,269
understand that i told him a number of
times uh about that and they do seem to

1388
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
times uh about that and they do seem to
 

1389
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,710
times uh about that and they do seem to
want to understand

1390
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
want to understand
 

1391
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,669
want to understand
uh so um good it could have been this

1392
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
uh so um good it could have been this
 

1393
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,269
uh so um good it could have been this
the switch has been a bit

1394
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
the switch has been a bit
 

1395
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,510
the switch has been a bit
uh no good to switch it's probably

1396
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
uh no good to switch it's probably
 

1397
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,430
uh no good to switch it's probably
intermittent somewhere because

1398
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,440
intermittent somewhere because
 

1399
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,350
intermittent somewhere because
it goes intermittent every so often it

1400
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
it goes intermittent every so often it
 

1401
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,990
it goes intermittent every so often it
causes a crash

1402
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
causes a crash
 

1403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,630
causes a crash
possible but so my first question is

1404
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640
possible but so my first question is
 

1405
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,110
possible but so my first question is
your wi-fi is coming from the

1406
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
your wi-fi is coming from the
 

1407
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,350
your wi-fi is coming from the
uh from the bt supply device or is it

1408
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
uh from the bt supply device or is it
 

1409
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,950
uh from the bt supply device or is it
coming from your own route

1410
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
coming from your own route
 

1411
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,990
coming from your own route
it comes from a bt line and it goes up

1412
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
it comes from a bt line and it goes up
 

1413
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,269
it comes from a bt line and it goes up
into a

1414
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
into a
 

1415
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,830
into a
wire then it goes into the thing okay so

1416
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
wire then it goes into the thing okay so
 

1417
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,110
wire then it goes into the thing okay so
the first thing i would do

1418
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
the first thing i would do
 

1419
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,269
the first thing i would do
is first thing i would disable that in

1420
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
is first thing i would disable that in
 

1421
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,710
is first thing i would disable that in
the bt router

1422
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
the bt router
 

1423
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,789
the bt router
and then i would go get another router

1424
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
and then i would go get another router
 

1425
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,990
and then i would go get another router
like a netgear

1426
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
like a netgear
 

1427
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,789
like a netgear
or a microtech or something like that

1428
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
or a microtech or something like that
 

1429
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,190
or a microtech or something like that
plug that into your bt router

1430
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
plug that into your bt router
 

1431
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,389
plug that into your bt router
and then let the microtech um or

1432
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
and then let the microtech um or
 

1433
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:52,870
and then let the microtech um or
whatever

1434
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
whatever
 

1435
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,950
whatever
whatever router you get let that provide

1436
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
whatever router you get let that provide
 

1437
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,070
whatever router you get let that provide
the wi-fi

1438
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
the wi-fi
 

1439
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,830
the wi-fi
for you so that all the telecom modem is

1440
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
for you so that all the telecom modem is
 

1441
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,190
for you so that all the telecom modem is
doing

1442
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
doing
 

1443
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,750
doing
is literally just providing you an

1444
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
is literally just providing you an
 

1445
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,950
is literally just providing you an
internet connection

1446
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:04,960
internet connection
 

1447
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,950
internet connection
and then you manage the network from

1448
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
and then you manage the network from
 

1449
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,230
and then you manage the network from
there in

1450
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
there in
 

1451
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,750
there in
and also if he uh if he uh

1452
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
and also if he uh if he uh
 

1453
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,269
and also if he uh if he uh
when he turns off the wi-fi from the

1454
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
when he turns off the wi-fi from the
 

1455
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,549
when he turns off the wi-fi from the
bta router

1456
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
bta router
 

1457
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,710
bta router
and in in the new router if he uses the

1458
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
and in in the new router if he uses the
 

1459
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,830
and in in the new router if he uses the
same ssid

1460
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
same ssid
 

1461
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,149
same ssid
