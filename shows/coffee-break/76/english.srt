to the coffee break and uh my news
 

27
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,549
to the coffee break and uh my news
basically this week

28
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
basically this week
 

29
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,150
basically this week
is uh uh is to do with yesterday oh

30
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
is uh uh is to do with yesterday oh
 

31
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,150
is uh uh is to do with yesterday oh
yesterday last week i think i talked

32
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
yesterday last week i think i talked
 

33
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,510
yesterday last week i think i talked
about um

34
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
about um
 

35
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,430
about um
uh primarily

36
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
uh primarily
 

37
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,869
uh primarily
uh unit tests in c programs

38
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
uh unit tests in c programs
 

39
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,189
uh unit tests in c programs
and that was a big deal for me because i

40
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
and that was a big deal for me because i
 

41
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,590
and that was a big deal for me because i
used to do that in java all that time

42
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
used to do that in java all that time
 

43
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,709
used to do that in java all that time
where i would try to get 70 or 80

44
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
where i would try to get 70 or 80
 

45
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,830
where i would try to get 70 or 80
coverage on my on my java code

46
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
coverage on my on my java code
 

47
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,910
coverage on my on my java code
for you know for commercial reasons that

48
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
for you know for commercial reasons that
 

49
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,510
for you know for commercial reasons that
was required you know you needed to be

50
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
was required you know you needed to be
 

51
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,830
was required you know you needed to be
sure

52
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
sure
 

53
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,149
sure
that your code matched that your code

54
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
that your code matched that your code
 

55
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,270
that your code matched that your code
actually did what you expected it to do

56
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280

 

57
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,310

so what i've done uh one of the other

58
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
so what i've done uh one of the other
 

59
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,749
so what i've done uh one of the other
things that we'd like to do is to make

60
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
things that we'd like to do is to make
 

61
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,149
things that we'd like to do is to make
sure you get good code coverage

62
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
sure you get good code coverage
 

63
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,870
sure you get good code coverage
and with code coverage that's something

64
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
and with code coverage that's something
 

65
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,990
and with code coverage that's something
that's that's

66
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
that's that's
 

67
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,230
that's that's
not well that i did not think was quite

68
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
not well that i did not think was quite
 

69
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,950
not well that i did not think was quite
so easy to get with um

70
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
so easy to get with um
 

71
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,469
so easy to get with um
with c but it turns out it's trivial

72
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
with c but it turns out it's trivial
 

73
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,670
with c but it turns out it's trivial
the gcc compiler

74
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
the gcc compiler
 

75
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,910
the gcc compiler
will quite happily generate coverage

76
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
will quite happily generate coverage
 

77
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,030
will quite happily generate coverage
data for you

78
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
data for you
 

79
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,429
data for you
when you use the minus minus coverage

80
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
when you use the minus minus coverage
 

81
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,749
when you use the minus minus coverage
command one argument so you give that

82
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
command one argument so you give that
 

83
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,350
command one argument so you give that
command line argument to the

84
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
command line argument to the
 

85
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,190
command line argument to the
to the compiler and to the linker

86
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
to the compiler and to the linker
 

87
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,830
to the compiler and to the linker
and then when you run the program with

88
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
and then when you run the program with
 

89
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,350
and then when you run the program with
your test harness

90
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
your test harness
 

91
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,030
your test harness
what will happen is it will run all of

92
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
what will happen is it will run all of
 

93
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,950
what will happen is it will run all of
the tests and it will just

94
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
the tests and it will just
 

95
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,270
the tests and it will just
it'll just uh uh you just run all the

96
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
it'll just uh uh you just run all the
 

97
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,789
it'll just uh uh you just run all the
tests that you that you have in your

98
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
tests that you that you have in your
 

99
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,709
tests that you that you have in your
test suite

100
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
test suite
 

101
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,990
test suite
in the end you get a whole bunch of

102
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
in the end you get a whole bunch of
 

103
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,749
in the end you get a whole bunch of
coverage data that you then convert to

104
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
coverage data that you then convert to
 

105
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,429
coverage data that you then convert to
an html page

106
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
an html page
 

107
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,510
an html page
and you get a you get a very nice

108
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
and you get a you get a very nice
 

109
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,190
and you get a you get a very nice
uh screen um a website basically

110
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
uh screen um a website basically
 

111
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,190
uh screen um a website basically
that tells you how much what sort of

112
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
that tells you how much what sort of
 

113
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,949
that tells you how much what sort of
coverage you get at the whole program

114
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
coverage you get at the whole program
 

115
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,510
coverage you get at the whole program
level

116
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
level
 

117
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,990
level
and then at each file level and even

118
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
and then at each file level and even
 

119
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,710
and then at each file level and even
down to each

120
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
down to each
 

121
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,589
down to each
um function and line level if you wanted

122
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
um function and line level if you wanted
 

123
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,229
um function and line level if you wanted
to do that

124
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
to do that
 

125
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,390
to do that
so that's been fun for me i've been

126
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
so that's been fun for me i've been
 

127
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,990
so that's been fun for me i've been
getting into that

128
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
getting into that
 

129
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,589
getting into that
um i have been working on that client

130
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
um i have been working on that client
 

131
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,509
um i have been working on that client
server program that i mentioned probably

132
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
server program that i mentioned probably
 

133
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,270
server program that i mentioned probably
a week or two ago

134
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
a week or two ago
 

135
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,550
a week or two ago
where i've been trying to get the um

136
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
where i've been trying to get the um
 

137
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,750
where i've been trying to get the um
uh where i've been trying to get the um

138
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
uh where i've been trying to get the um
 

139
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,150
uh where i've been trying to get the um
um uh the the

140
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
um uh the the
 

141
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,550
um uh the the
the client to encrypt and then sign the

142
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
the client to encrypt and then sign the
 

143
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,350
the client to encrypt and then sign the
payload

144
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
payload
 

145
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,790
payload
and then have the server um uh

146
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
and then have the server um uh
 

147
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,030
and then have the server um uh
decrypt and then verify the signature on

148
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
decrypt and then verify the signature on
 

149
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,550
decrypt and then verify the signature on
the payload

150
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
the payload
 

151
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,750
the payload
but i haven't been able to make that

152
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
but i haven't been able to make that
 

153
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,070
but i haven't been able to make that
work reliably at first i couldn't get it

154
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
work reliably at first i couldn't get it
 

155
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,309
work reliably at first i couldn't get it
to work at all until i figured out just

156
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
to work at all until i figured out just
 

157
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,030
to work at all until i figured out just
just by looking at other people's code

158
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
just by looking at other people's code
 

159
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,830
just by looking at other people's code
how to

160
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
how to
 

161
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,750
how to
how i had to create a hash of the

162
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
how i had to create a hash of the
 

163
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,430
how i had to create a hash of the
payload and then encrypt

164
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
payload and then encrypt
 

165
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,949
payload and then encrypt
and then sign the hash that

166
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
and then sign the hash that
 

167
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,830
and then sign the hash that
works but it doesn't work reliably i can

168
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
works but it doesn't work reliably i can
 

169
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,990
works but it doesn't work reliably i can
out of ten runs i can make it work maybe

170
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
out of ten runs i can make it work maybe
 

171
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,190
out of ten runs i can make it work maybe
seven times

172
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
seven times
 

173
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,110
seven times
out of those tens but i haven't changed

174
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
out of those tens but i haven't changed
 

175
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,030
out of those tens but i haven't changed
anything all i do is i run that test

176
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
anything all i do is i run that test
 

177
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,750
anything all i do is i run that test
harness over and over and over again

178
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
harness over and over and over again
 

179
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,750
harness over and over and over again
sometimes it works and sometimes it

180
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
sometimes it works and sometimes it
 

181
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,990
sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn't and i don't know why

182
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
doesn't and i don't know why
 

183
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,350
doesn't and i don't know why
so if anyone has any insight into that

184
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
so if anyone has any insight into that
 

185
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,190
so if anyone has any insight into that
i'd love to hear it because right now i

186
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
i'd love to hear it because right now i
 

187
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,589
i'd love to hear it because right now i
can't

188
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
can't
 

189
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,390
can't
uh uh right now i can't do anything

190
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
uh uh right now i can't do anything
 

191
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,110
uh uh right now i can't do anything
about that

192
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
about that
 

193
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,869
about that
so what's your connection between the

194
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
so what's your connection between the
 

195
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,350
so what's your connection between the
client and the server

196
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
client and the server
 

197
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,550
client and the server
uh it is a uh it is a tcp socket

198
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
uh it is a uh it is a tcp socket
 

199
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,990
uh it is a uh it is a tcp socket
but since both are running on the

200
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
but since both are running on the
 

201
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,110
but since both are running on the
well correction on when i'm running it

202
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
well correction on when i'm running it
 

203
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,030
well correction on when i'm running it
on the test harness

204
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
on the test harness
 

205
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,710
on the test harness
um the connection there is no connect

206
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
um the connection there is no connect
 

207
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,869
um the connection there is no connect
they're running in the same process

208
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
they're running in the same process
 

209
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,309
they're running in the same process
um so i'm i'm taking a payload i'm

210
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
um so i'm i'm taking a payload i'm
 

211
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,990
um so i'm i'm taking a payload i'm
let me put it in frame i'm taking a

212
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
let me put it in frame i'm taking a
 

213
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,789
let me put it in frame i'm taking a
payload i'm signing it

214
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
payload i'm signing it
 

215
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,670
payload i'm signing it
and then i'm taking that signed payload

216
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
and then i'm taking that signed payload
 

217
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,509
and then i'm taking that signed payload
and then verifying the signature with a

218
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
and then verifying the signature with a
 

219
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,110
and then verifying the signature with a
different crypto function

220
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
different crypto function
 

221
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,670
different crypto function
all in the same process all on the same

222
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
all in the same process all on the same
 

223
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,270
all in the same process all on the same
machine

224
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
machine
 

225
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,710
machine
are correct yes sir okay now maybe

226
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
are correct yes sir okay now maybe
 

227
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,950
are correct yes sir okay now maybe
maybe it doesn't like me signing and

228
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
maybe it doesn't like me signing and
 

229
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,870
maybe it doesn't like me signing and
verifying the very same signature on the

230
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
verifying the very same signature on the
 

231
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,150
verifying the very same signature on the
very same payload

232
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
very same payload
 

233
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,390
very same payload
maybe maybe i have to do it in separate

234
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
maybe maybe i have to do it in separate
 

235
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,390
maybe maybe i have to do it in separate
processes or something i don't know

236
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
processes or something i don't know
 

237
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,230
processes or something i don't know
how about trying it on separate machines

238
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240

 

239
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,990

uh i could do that but then i would need

240
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
uh i could do that but then i would need
 

241
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,590
uh i could do that but then i would need
to actually write the code that makes

242
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
to actually write the code that makes
 

243
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,430
to actually write the code that makes
the connection between the two machines

244
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
the connection between the two machines
 

245
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,830
the connection between the two machines
i have not written that code yet i'm i'm

246
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
i have not written that code yet i'm i'm
 

247
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,110
i have not written that code yet i'm i'm
basically proving

248
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
basically proving
 

249
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,390
basically proving
that i can encrypt and sign first and

250
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
that i can encrypt and sign first and
 

251
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,550
that i can encrypt and sign first and
then i'm going to write the code and

252
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
then i'm going to write the code and
 

253
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,150
then i'm going to write the code and
and verify that it will talk over the

254
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
and verify that it will talk over the
 

255
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,150
and verify that it will talk over the
internet over tcp

256
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
internet over tcp
 

257
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,469
internet over tcp
socket i'm confident i can do that i've

258
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
socket i'm confident i can do that i've
 

259
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,350
socket i'm confident i can do that i've
written that code

260
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
written that code
 

261
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,590
written that code
enough times that i can you know i'm

262
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
enough times that i can you know i'm
 

263
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,950
enough times that i can you know i'm
confident that i can

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
confident that i can
 

265
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,510
confident that i can
make that part work what i wasn't sure

266
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
make that part work what i wasn't sure
 

267
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,110
make that part work what i wasn't sure
about

268
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
about
 

269
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,029
about
considering the unreliability i'm just

270
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
considering the unreliability i'm just
 

271
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,310
considering the unreliability i'm just
wondering if something's not getting

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
wondering if something's not getting

275
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,550

well for for this it's not there's no

well for for this it's not there's no
 

277
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,150
well for for this it's not there's no

00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
second time or the third time round
 

331
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,670
second time or the third time round
of that one well the program code the

332
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
of that one well the program code the
 

333
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,990
of that one well the program code the
program code is identical for each run

334
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
program code is identical for each run
 

335
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,150
program code is identical for each run
and the payload is identical for each

336
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
and the payload is identical for each
 

337
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,990
and the payload is identical for each
run the only thing that's different

338
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
run the only thing that's different
 

339
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,950
run the only thing that's different
is the is is the signed value because

340
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
is the is is the signed value because
 

341
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,469
is the is is the signed value because
the seed is slightly different

342
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
the seed is slightly different
 

343
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,110
the seed is slightly different
each time it each time it runs but i

344
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
each time it each time it runs but i
 

345
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,309
each time it each time it runs but i
can't imagine that that would have

346
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
can't imagine that that would have
 

347
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,070
can't imagine that that would have
anything to do with

348
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
anything to do with
 

349
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,830
anything to do with
uh i can't imagine that would have

350
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
uh i can't imagine that would have
 

351
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,830
uh i can't imagine that would have
anything to

352
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
anything to
 

353
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,510
anything to
that's the only thing i could think is

354
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
that's the only thing i could think is
 

355
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,430
that's the only thing i could think is
something there's something changing

356
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
something there's something changing
 

357
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,710
something there's something changing
because it says like something's

358
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
because it says like something's
 

359
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,950
because it says like something's
changing in the loop somewhere

360
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
changing in the loop somewhere
 

361
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,029
changing in the loop somewhere
and that's why it's not working oh i

362
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
and that's why it's not working oh i
 

363
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,990
and that's why it's not working oh i
would agree

364
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
would agree
 

365
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,550
would agree
yeah i would agree that uh that

366
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
yeah i would agree that uh that
 

367
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,150
yeah i would agree that uh that
something's different but the thing is i

368
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
something's different but the thing is i
 

369
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,430
something's different but the thing is i
don't know what's different

370
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
don't know what's different
 

371
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,990
don't know what's different
and here's the here's the unfortunate

372
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
and here's the here's the unfortunate
 

373
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,510
and here's the here's the unfortunate
part about using

374
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
part about using
 

375
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,390
part about using
libraries from your from your code uh

376
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
libraries from your from your code uh
 

377
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,230
libraries from your from your code uh
just like you do in pascal peter when

378
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
just like you do in pascal peter when
 

379
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,550
just like you do in pascal peter when
you use units right or when you use

380
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
you use units right or when you use
 

381
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,790
you use units right or when you use
libraries you rely on those libraries to

382
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
libraries you rely on those libraries to
 

383
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,070
libraries you rely on those libraries to
do the right thing

384
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
do the right thing
 

385
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,749
do the right thing
but in order for the libraries to do the

386
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
but in order for the libraries to do the
 

387
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,270
but in order for the libraries to do the
right thing you have to actually

388
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
right thing you have to actually
 

389
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,150
right thing you have to actually
understand how the libraries work

390
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
understand how the libraries work
 

391
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,150
understand how the libraries work
and i'm not quite sure that i've that

392
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
and i'm not quite sure that i've that
 

393
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,309
and i'm not quite sure that i've that
i've understood all the rules that are

394
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
i've understood all the rules that are
 

395
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,670
i've understood all the rules that are
involved around

396
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
involved around
 

397
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,309
involved around
around calling the various especially

398
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
around calling the various especially
 

399
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,990
around calling the various especially
crypto functions because

400
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
crypto functions because
 

401
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,550
crypto functions because
they are so sensitive all right horrible

402
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
they are so sensitive all right horrible
 

403
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,510
they are so sensitive all right horrible
things yeah

404
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
things yeah
 

405
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,749
things yeah
and you have to pull the right right

406
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
and you have to pull the right right
 

407
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,589
and you have to pull the right right
things into it as well because that can

408
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
things into it as well because that can
 

409
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,390
things into it as well because that can
make you go

410
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
make you go
 

411
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,909
make you go
bang as well oh sure yeah oh

412
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
bang as well oh sure yeah oh
 

413
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,150
bang as well oh sure yeah oh
absolutely but anyway because i'm

414
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
absolutely but anyway because i'm
 

415
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,309
absolutely but anyway because i'm
running exactly the same code

416
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
running exactly the same code
 

417
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,350
running exactly the same code
go ahead i'm sorry is there any way to

418
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
go ahead i'm sorry is there any way to
 

419
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,309
go ahead i'm sorry is there any way to
monitor the throughput

420
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319

 

421
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,150

is there any way to monitor the threat

422
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
is there any way to monitor the threat
 

423
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,070
is there any way to monitor the threat
literally

424
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
literally
 

425
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,749
literally
i'm thinking i'm thinking i could

426
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
i'm thinking i'm thinking i could
 

427
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,110
i'm thinking i'm thinking i could
literally step through the code

428
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
literally step through the code
 

429
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,230
literally step through the code
with the the gnu debugger um

430
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
with the the gnu debugger um
 

431
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,270
with the the gnu debugger um
if i wanted to do that um i

432
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
if i wanted to do that um i
 

433
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,350
if i wanted to do that um i
typically don't like stepping through

434
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
typically don't like stepping through
 

435
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,350
typically don't like stepping through
the code because it changes all the

436
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
the code because it changes all the
 

437
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,150
the code because it changes all the
timings

438
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
timings
 

439
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,629
timings
around how the code works right so i'm

440
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
around how the code works right so i'm
 

441
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,270
around how the code works right so i'm
not sure that

442
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
not sure that
 

443
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,790
not sure that
so i'm not sure that stepping through

444
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
so i'm not sure that stepping through
 

445
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,790
so i'm not sure that stepping through
the code is going to be very productive

446
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
the code is going to be very productive
 

447
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,510
the code is going to be very productive
yeah i would rather rely on log messages

448
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
yeah i would rather rely on log messages
 

449
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,710
yeah i would rather rely on log messages
except the problem is

450
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
except the problem is
 

451
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,550
except the problem is
that log messages even so tend to

452
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
that log messages even so tend to
 

453
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,869
that log messages even so tend to
uh alter the timing of the code if

454
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
uh alter the timing of the code if
 

455
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,309
uh alter the timing of the code if
you're writing a lot of messages to the

456
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
you're writing a lot of messages to the
 

457
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,110
you're writing a lot of messages to the
console

458
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
console
 

459
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,589
console
that slows the whole program down and

460
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
that slows the whole program down and
 

461
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,110
that slows the whole program down and
that could be enough

462
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
that could be enough
 

463
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,469
that could be enough
to uh to hide the bug um

464
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
to uh to hide the bug um
 

465
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,190
to uh to hide the bug um
you know right is there any way to reach

466
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200

 

467
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,709

is there any way to record the

468
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
is there any way to record the
 

469
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,389
is there any way to record the
throughput and then step through it

470
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
throughput and then step through it
 

471
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,870
throughput and then step through it
afterwards

472
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880

 

473
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,949

i'm not sure about that i'm not sure how

474
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
i'm not sure about that i'm not sure how
 

475
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,949
i'm not sure about that i'm not sure how
i would do that

476
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
i would do that
 

477
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,630
i would do that
um i mean i i write log messages uh

478
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
um i mean i i write log messages uh
 

479
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,190
um i mean i i write log messages uh
as far as the results of the tests go

480
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
as far as the results of the tests go
 

481
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,230
as far as the results of the tests go
and so from that

482
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
and so from that
 

483
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,430
and so from that
i can tell um whether the

484
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
i can tell um whether the
 

485
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,350
i can tell um whether the
whether the encrypt or the the signing

486
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
whether the encrypt or the the signing
 

487
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,710
whether the encrypt or the the signing
was successful or not

488
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
was successful or not
 

489
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,430
was successful or not
because i get a return code back to

490
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
because i get a return code back to
 

491
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,030
because i get a return code back to
return code zero then the signing was

492
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
return code zero then the signing was
 

493
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,949
return code zero then the signing was
successful and it's all good right

494
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
successful and it's all good right
 

495
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,350
successful and it's all good right
but if the return code comes back with

496
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
but if the return code comes back with
 

497
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,430
but if the return code comes back with
some nonsensical value

498
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
some nonsensical value
 

499
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,829
some nonsensical value
and that nonsensical value by the way if

500
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
and that nonsensical value by the way if
 

501
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,509
and that nonsensical value by the way if
you convert it to hex and then

502
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
you convert it to hex and then
 

503
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,790
you convert it to hex and then
you know take away the the very highest

504
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
you know take away the the very highest
 

505
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,910
you know take away the the very highest
bit it resolves in it resolves to

506
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
bit it resolves in it resolves to
 

507
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,430
bit it resolves in it resolves to
what i think is a return code that means

508
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
what i think is a return code that means
 

509
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,070
what i think is a return code that means
a conflict

510
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
a conflict
 

511
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,470
a conflict
of some sort but there's no

512
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
of some sort but there's no
 

513
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,870
of some sort but there's no
documentation about what that conflict

514
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
documentation about what that conflict
 

515
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,590
documentation about what that conflict
return code means it just says uh yeah

516
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
return code means it just says uh yeah
 

517
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,630
return code means it just says uh yeah
there was a conflict

518
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
there was a conflict
 

519
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,370
there was a conflict
well thanks i knew that

520
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:46,380
well thanks i knew that
 

521
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,949
well thanks i knew that
[Laughter]

522
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959

 

523
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,190

if i'm reading the return code correctly

524
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
if i'm reading the return code correctly
 

525
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,710
if i'm reading the return code correctly
that's what it means but

526
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
that's what it means but
 

527
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,750
that's what it means but
but how on earth do i do i

528
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
but how on earth do i do i
 

529
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,949
but how on earth do i do i
um you know how do i

530
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
um you know how do i
 

531
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,990
um you know how do i
proceed with that i don't know so i'm

532
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
proceed with that i don't know so i'm
 

533
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,389
proceed with that i don't know so i'm
going to keep plugging away at it

534
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
going to keep plugging away at it
 

535
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,910
going to keep plugging away at it
sometimes when i see some

536
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
sometimes when i see some
 

537
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,389
sometimes when i see some
error message from some process and

538
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
error message from some process and
 

539
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,269
error message from some process and
sometimes i

540
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
sometimes i
 

541
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,430
sometimes i
think to myself yeah i knew that tell me

542
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
think to myself yeah i knew that tell me
 

543
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,630
think to myself yeah i knew that tell me
something i don't know

544
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640

 

545
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,030

exactly right that's exactly how i feel

546
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
exactly right that's exactly how i feel
 

547
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,750
exactly right that's exactly how i feel
right now and

548
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
right now and
 

549
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,990
right now and
i get i get it if i'm reading the return

550
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
i get i get it if i'm reading the return
 

551
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,389
i get i get it if i'm reading the return
code correctly because it did involve

552
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
code correctly because it did involve
 

553
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,630
code correctly because it did involve
converting it to hex dropping off that

554
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
converting it to hex dropping off that
 

555
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,269
converting it to hex dropping off that
high value that high bit value at the

556
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
high value that high bit value at the
 

557
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:33,750
high value that high bit value at the
very

558
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
very
 

559
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,069
very
high level and then reading the

560
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
high level and then reading the
 

561
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,670
high level and then reading the
remainder because it was what the bit

562
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
remainder because it was what the bit
 

563
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,710
remainder because it was what the bit
level was one

564
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
level was one
 

565
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,269
level was one
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero

566
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
 

567
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,829
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
and then

568
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
and then
 

569
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,069
and then
whatever was the hex value of the return

570
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
whatever was the hex value of the return
 

571
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,550
whatever was the hex value of the return
code was one idea that i'm

572
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
code was one idea that i'm
 

573
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,269
code was one idea that i'm
thinking of yeah you said you are uh

574
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
thinking of yeah you said you are uh
 

575
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,829
thinking of yeah you said you are uh
signing

576
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
signing
 

577
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,790
signing
um a payload and then you are verifying

578
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
um a payload and then you are verifying
 

579
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,430
um a payload and then you are verifying
that it's

580
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
that it's
 

581
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,630
that it's
signed correctly correct yeah and

582
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
signed correctly correct yeah and
 

583
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,910
signed correctly correct yeah and
have you tried just to verify that

584
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920

 

585
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,790

that it's um have you tried uh

586
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
that it's um have you tried uh
 

587
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,670
that it's um have you tried uh
decrypting

588
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
decrypting
 

589
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,630
decrypting
the payload afterwards save the each of

590
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
the payload afterwards save the each of
 

591
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,670
the payload afterwards save the each of
the payloads

592
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
the payloads
 

593
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,470
the payloads
um save one that is correct and one that

594
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,480
um save one that is correct and one that
 

595
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,430
um save one that is correct and one that
is not correct

596
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
is not correct
 

597
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,910
is not correct
and then decrypt each one and see and

598
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
and then decrypt each one and see and
 

599
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,870
and then decrypt each one and see and
then see

600
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
then see
 

601
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,990
then see
what is different yeah so i'm doing so

602
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
what is different yeah so i'm doing so
 

603
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,790
what is different yeah so i'm doing so
i'm doing

604
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
i'm doing
 

605
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,389
i'm doing
the um the encrypt and decrypt

606
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
the um the encrypt and decrypt
 

607
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,829
the um the encrypt and decrypt
separately from the signing and

608
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
separately from the signing and
 

609
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,509
separately from the signing and
verifying to prove that i can do each

610
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
verifying to prove that i can do each
 

611
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,750
verifying to prove that i can do each
individually and then if i can prove i

612
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
individually and then if i can prove i
 

613
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,670
individually and then if i can prove i
can do each individually

614
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
can do each individually
 

615
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,550
can do each individually
then i will take the payload sign it

616
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
then i will take the payload sign it
 

617
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,150
then i will take the payload sign it
encrypt it

618
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
encrypt it
 

619
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,350
encrypt it
decrypt it verify the signature and then

620
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
decrypt it verify the signature and then
 

621
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,350
decrypt it verify the signature and then
retrieve the payload i'm not to that

622
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
retrieve the payload i'm not to that
 

623
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,430
retrieve the payload i'm not to that
point yet i've proven i can encrypt and

624
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
point yet i've proven i can encrypt and
 

625
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,870
point yet i've proven i can encrypt and
decrypt no problem at all

626
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
decrypt no problem at all
 

627
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,670
decrypt no problem at all
i can do that that's that works just for

628
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
i can do that that's that works just for
 

629
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,110
i can do that that's that works just for
i can do that reliably

630
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
i can do that reliably
 

631
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,829
i can do that reliably
every single time no worries at all but

632
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
every single time no worries at all but
 

633
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,230
every single time no worries at all but
it's the

634
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
it's the
 

635
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,110
it's the
it's the whole signing and then

636
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
it's the whole signing and then
 

637
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,030
it's the whole signing and then
verifying the signature of the payload

638
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
verifying the signature of the payload
 

639
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,110
verifying the signature of the payload
that is that is biting me right now

640
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
that is that is biting me right now
 

641
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,150
that is that is biting me right now
yeah that is exactly my point have you

642
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
yeah that is exactly my point have you
 

643
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,550
yeah that is exactly my point have you
uh

644
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
uh
 

645
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,829
uh
tried just to verify that

646
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
tried just to verify that
 

647
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,870
tried just to verify that
you know if not to eliminate

648
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
you know if not to eliminate
 

649
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,150
you know if not to eliminate
that those two payloads

650
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
that those two payloads
 

651
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,470
that those two payloads
are actually the same even though you

652
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
are actually the same even though you
 

653
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,829
are actually the same even though you
haven't um

654
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
haven't um
 

655
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,150
haven't um
come to the point where uh you have any

656
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
come to the point where uh you have any
 

657
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,949
come to the point where uh you have any
um

658
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
um
 

659
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,030
um
good use for it yet but just to verify

660
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
good use for it yet but just to verify
 

661
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,069
good use for it yet but just to verify
that okay

662
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079

 

663
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,990

yes i've done that with a very good

664
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
yes i've done that with a very good
 

665
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,350
yes i've done that with a very good
yeah so i've done that with i've done

666
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
yeah so i've done that with i've done
 

667
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,509
yeah so i've done that with i've done
that with encrypting and decrypting

668
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519

 

669
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,790

all right peter go ahead sir

670
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
all right peter go ahead sir
 

671
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,069
all right peter go ahead sir
i'm gonna be rude but they could do a

672
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
i'm gonna be rude but they could do a
 

673
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,990
i'm gonna be rude but they could do a
checksum before and check them off to

674
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
checksum before and check them off to
 

675
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,829
checksum before and check them off to
see if their numbers change

676
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
see if their numbers change
 

677
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,629
see if their numbers change
because i have that okay yeah that's no

678
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
because i have that okay yeah that's no
 

679
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,430
because i have that okay yeah that's no
idea

680
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
idea
 

681
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,470
idea
okay so so the thing is

682
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
okay so so the thing is
 

683
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,750
okay so so the thing is
the payload is plain text okay it's just

684
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
the payload is plain text okay it's just
 

685
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,949
the payload is plain text okay it's just
it's literally a json document okay

686
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
it's literally a json document okay
 

687
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,310
it's literally a json document okay
so it's trivial to verify that the

688
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
so it's trivial to verify that the
 

689
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,069
so it's trivial to verify that the
payload is the same

690
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
payload is the same
 

691
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,750
payload is the same
now the operation of signing a payload

692
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
now the operation of signing a payload
 

693
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,190
now the operation of signing a payload
does not change the payload signing the

694
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
does not change the payload signing the
 

695
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,629
does not change the payload signing the
payload creates a

696
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
payload creates a
 

697
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,069
payload creates a
separate a hex string

698
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
separate a hex string
 

699
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,949
separate a hex string
that you store separately okay and then

700
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
that you store separately okay and then
 

701
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,750
that you store separately okay and then
you take

702
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
you take
 

703
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,150
you take
both of those and you encrypt them

704
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
both of those and you encrypt them
 

705
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,069
both of those and you encrypt them
then later on after you've sent it over

706
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
then later on after you've sent it over
 

707
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,350
then later on after you've sent it over
the interwebs or whatever you've done

708
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
the interwebs or whatever you've done
 

709
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,710
the interwebs or whatever you've done
you decrypt it

710
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
you decrypt it
 

711
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,710
you decrypt it
and then you take that signature and you

712
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
and then you take that signature and you
 

713
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,310
and then you take that signature and you
verify the

714
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
verify the
 

715
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,590
verify the
the payload after you know

716
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
the payload after you know
 

717
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,350
the payload after you know
from the signature you do not

718
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
from the signature you do not
 

719
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,310
from the signature you do not
the payload does not change when you

720
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
the payload does not change when you
 

721
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,790
the payload does not change when you
sign

722
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
sign
 

723
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,990
sign
or verify the signature so the

724
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
or verify the signature so the
 

725
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,710
or verify the signature so the
trick is in order to test to make sure

726
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
trick is in order to test to make sure
 

727
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,949
trick is in order to test to make sure
the signing and verifying work

728
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
the signing and verifying work
 

729
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,910
the signing and verifying work
is that you sign it you get the

730
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
is that you sign it you get the
 

731
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,030
is that you sign it you get the
signature

732
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
signature
 

733
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,110
signature
and then you pass that signature to the

734
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
and then you pass that signature to the
 

735
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,590
and then you pass that signature to the
verify along with the payload

736
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
verify along with the payload
 

737
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,230
verify along with the payload
and you say okay does this does this

738
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
and you say okay does this does this
 

739
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,949
and you say okay does this does this
verify

740
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
verify
 

741
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,230
verify
does this verify correctly the only

742
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
does this verify correctly the only
 

743
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,110
does this verify correctly the only
thing that i can

744
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
thing that i can
 

745
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,990
thing that i can
think of that um there are two places

746
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
think of that um there are two places
 

747
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
think of that um there are two places
that i can think of that

748
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
that i can think of that
 

749
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,230
that i can think of that
there might be a problem one is uh that

750
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
there might be a problem one is uh that
 

751
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,350
there might be a problem one is uh that
uh the actual

752
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
uh the actual
 

753
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,550
uh the actual
signing uh uh fails somehow

754
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
signing uh uh fails somehow
 

755
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,750
signing uh uh fails somehow
or that the verification

756
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
or that the verification
 

757
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,509
or that the verification
fails somehow and it doesn't tell you

758
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
fails somehow and it doesn't tell you
 

759
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,430
fails somehow and it doesn't tell you
why or where it there or

760
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
why or where it there or
 

761
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,870
why or where it there or
yeah okay so

762
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
yeah okay so
 

763
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,870
yeah okay so
the point of failure is the signing

764
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
the point of failure is the signing
 

765
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,550
the point of failure is the signing
because i can see the signature

766
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
because i can see the signature
 

767
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,189
because i can see the signature
as well as get a zero return code

768
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
as well as get a zero return code
 

769
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,629
as well as get a zero return code
whenever the

770
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
whenever the
 

771
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,150
whenever the
signing operation is correct it works

772
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
signing operation is correct it works
 

773
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,550
signing operation is correct it works
so i can see the signature okay because

774
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
so i can see the signature okay because
 

775
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,629
so i can see the signature okay because
i i print that in my log message

776
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
i i print that in my log message
 

777
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,310
i i print that in my log message
so if the signing does not work

778
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
so if the signing does not work
 

779
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,110
so if the signing does not work
um my test code is dumb i just go ahead

780
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
um my test code is dumb i just go ahead
 

781
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,470
um my test code is dumb i just go ahead
and try to verify it anyway but of

782
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
and try to verify it anyway but of
 

783
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,910
and try to verify it anyway but of
course there's nothing to verify because

784
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
course there's nothing to verify because
 

785
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,430
course there's nothing to verify because
the signature failed

786
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
the signature failed
 

787
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,949
the signature failed
so the point out the point of failure is

788
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
so the point out the point of failure is
 

789
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,870
so the point out the point of failure is
the signature is the signing of the of

790
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
the signature is the signing of the of
 

791
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,389
the signature is the signing of the of
the payload

792
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
the payload
 

793
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,150
the payload
that's where the failure is happening i

794
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
that's where the failure is happening i
 

795
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,509
that's where the failure is happening i
i can tell you that

796
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
i can tell you that
 

797
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,230
i can tell you that
unequivocally it i've never had a an

798
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
unequivocally it i've never had a an
 

799
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,710
unequivocally it i've never had a an
issue where if it signed successfully

800
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
issue where if it signed successfully
 

801
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,269
issue where if it signed successfully
that verification failed if it signed

802
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
that verification failed if it signed
 

803
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,230
that verification failed if it signed
successfully

804
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
successfully
 

805
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,710
successfully
verification worked every single time

806
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
verification worked every single time
 

807
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,069
verification worked every single time
but the signing

808
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
but the signing
 

809
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,269
but the signing
is where it's filing could it be that um

810
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279

 

811
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,150

it could be a timing issue uh could it

812
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
it could be a timing issue uh could it
 

813
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,030
it could be a timing issue uh could it
be um

814
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
be um
 

815
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,870
be um
i'm just thinking out of my head as

816
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
i'm just thinking out of my head as
 

817
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,310
i'm just thinking out of my head as
usual could it be that um

818
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
usual could it be that um
 

819
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,030
usual could it be that um
but it's starting to sign before the

820
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
but it's starting to sign before the
 

821
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,829
but it's starting to sign before the
payload is

822
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
payload is
 

823
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,310
payload is
uh properly delivered so that it's

824
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
uh properly delivered so that it's
 

825
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,990
uh properly delivered so that it's
signing something and

826
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
signing something and
 

827
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,990
signing something and
um i think it's running too soon so to

828
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
um i think it's running too soon so to
 

829
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,389
um i think it's running too soon so to
say

830
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
say
 

831
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,590
say
oh so the test code so the test code

832
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:55,600
oh so the test code so the test code
 

833
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,470
oh so the test code so the test code
doesn't run

834
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
doesn't run
 

835
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,030
doesn't run
to it doesn't attempt to verify the

836
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
to it doesn't attempt to verify the
 

837
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,990
to it doesn't attempt to verify the
signature

838
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
signature
 

839
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,990
signature
until after the signing process is

840
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
until after the signing process is
 

841
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,870
until after the signing process is
complete

842
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
complete
 

843
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,670
complete
because i don't move on to the next

844
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
because i don't move on to the next
 

845
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,430
because i don't move on to the next
operation until i see a good

846
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
operation until i see a good
 

847
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,230
operation until i see a good
zero return code from the from the

848
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
zero return code from the from the
 

849
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,509
zero return code from the from the
signing process

850
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
signing process
 

851
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,710
signing process
yeah but so i don't think it can move i

852
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
yeah but so i don't think it can move i
 

853
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,110
yeah but so i don't think it can move i
don't

854
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
don't
 

855
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,749
don't
think it can move on to verifying until

856
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
think it can move on to verifying until
 

857
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,949
think it can move on to verifying until
after i know the signature's good

858
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
after i know the signature's good
 

859
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,990
after i know the signature's good
yeah and this is where uh either our

860
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
yeah and this is where uh either our
 

861
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,710
yeah and this is where uh either our
debugger or the debug messages would uh

862
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
debugger or the debug messages would uh
 

863
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,590
debugger or the debug messages would uh
come in handy

864
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
come in handy
 

865
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,030
come in handy
because then you can see if

866
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
because then you can see if
 

867
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,310
because then you can see if
if there's a time manager

868
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
if there's a time manager
 

869
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,189
if there's a time manager
yeah and by the way a big shout out to

870
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
yeah and by the way a big shout out to
 

871
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:39,990
yeah and by the way a big shout out to
the glib

872
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
the glib
 

873
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,030
the glib
uh test harness folks

874
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
uh test harness folks
 

875
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,269
uh test harness folks
they did a great job they did a very

876
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
they did a great job they did a very
 

877
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,629
they did a great job they did a very
good job making it

878
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
good job making it
 

879
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,509
good job making it
making the test harness look and work as

880
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
making the test harness look and work as
 

881
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,150
making the test harness look and work as
much like

882
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
much like
 

883
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,430
much like
uh the java equivalents

884
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
uh the java equivalents
 

885
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,030
uh the java equivalents
as um as as as i can

886
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
as um as as as i can
 

887
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,389
as um as as as i can
they did a better job that i could do

888
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
they did a better job that i could do
 

889
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,389
they did a better job that i could do
for instance because my clunky test

890
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
for instance because my clunky test
 

891
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,069
for instance because my clunky test
harness just runs all the tests

892
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
harness just runs all the tests
 

893
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,829
harness just runs all the tests
and i don't care how long it takes but

894
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
and i don't care how long it takes but
 

895
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,909
and i don't care how long it takes but
you can categorize tests to say whether

896
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
you can categorize tests to say whether
 

897
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,590
you can categorize tests to say whether
they're really really long running

898
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
they're really really long running
 

899
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,189
they're really really long running
and therefore whether you choose to run

900
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
and therefore whether you choose to run
 

901
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,750
and therefore whether you choose to run
them on a on a regular test harness yeah

902
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
them on a on a regular test harness yeah
 

903
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,429
them on a on a regular test harness yeah
all that sort of stuff

904
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
all that sort of stuff
 

905
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,429
all that sort of stuff
but now whether there's something going

906
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
but now whether there's something going
 

907
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,189
but now whether there's something going
on with the test harness now you know

908
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
on with the test harness now you know
 

909
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:17,990
on with the test harness now you know
there may be something

910
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
there may be something
 

911
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,150
there may be something
going on with the test code that i don't

912
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
going on with the test code that i don't
 

913
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,510
going on with the test code that i don't
know about you know but

914
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
know about you know but
 

915
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,909
know about you know but
this also proves that uh they're doing

916
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
this also proves that uh they're doing
 

917
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,429
this also proves that uh they're doing
uh something that requires an

918
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
uh something that requires an
 

919
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,669
uh something that requires an
encryption and doing it properly is

920
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
encryption and doing it properly is
 

921
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,630
encryption and doing it properly is
really hard

922
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
really hard
 

923
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,830
really hard
so those uh they are and

924
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
so those uh they are and
 

925
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,510
so those uh they are and
projects who do a good encryption um

926
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
projects who do a good encryption um
 

927
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,710
projects who do a good encryption um
um some of their

928
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
um some of their
 

929
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,270
um some of their
somewhere along the lines of such

930
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
somewhere along the lines of such
 

931
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,510
somewhere along the lines of such
problems they had to have

932
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
problems they had to have
 

933
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,630
problems they had to have
a couple of times in order to uh so um

934
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
a couple of times in order to uh so um
 

935
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,950
a couple of times in order to uh so um
yeah just explain it

936
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960

 

937
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,110

it's hard agreed i agree but i will say

938
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
it's hard agreed i agree but i will say
 

939
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,669
it's hard agreed i agree but i will say
again though

940
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
again though
 

941
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,230
again though
encryption is working great i can

942
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
encryption is working great i can
 

943
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,510
encryption is working great i can
encrypt and decrypt to my heart's

944
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
encrypt and decrypt to my heart's
 

945
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,350
encrypt and decrypt to my heart's
content and i get the same payload back

946
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
content and i get the same payload back
 

947
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,310
content and i get the same payload back
every time

948
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
every time
 

949
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,270
every time
not a problem that part works great it's

950
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
not a problem that part works great it's
 

951
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,590
not a problem that part works great it's
the signing that that's biting me in the

952
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
the signing that that's biting me in the
 

953
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,070
the signing that that's biting me in the
backside so that's the only thing that

954
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
backside so that's the only thing that
 

955
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,270
backside so that's the only thing that
i'm i'm trying to

956
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
i'm i'm trying to
 

957
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,510
i'm i'm trying to
uh i'm trying to get my head around i

958
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
uh i'm trying to get my head around i
 

959
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,710
uh i'm trying to get my head around i
don't understand i wouldn't be using

960
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720

 

961
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,750

rsa i believe

962
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
rsa i believe
 

963
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,789
rsa i believe
i need to go check i haven't looked i

965
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,830
i need to go check i haven't looked i
could go look

966
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
could go look
 

967
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,310
could go look
i mean i could but i don't want to mess

up the recording so

970
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
up the recording so
 

971
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,549
up the recording so
i'll tell you later

972
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559

 

973
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,830

uh yeah so that's what i've been up to

974
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
uh yeah so that's what i've been up to
 

975
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,230
uh yeah so that's what i've been up to
if anyone has any other other any other

976
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
if anyone has any other other any other
 

977
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,470
if anyone has any other other any other
ideas i'd be really happy to hear it

978
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
ideas i'd be really happy to hear it
 

979
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,390
ideas i'd be really happy to hear it
so let's go around the table real quick

980
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
so let's go around the table real quick
 

981
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,990
so let's go around the table real quick
because i've hogged up way too much time

982
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
because i've hogged up way too much time
 

983
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,029
because i've hogged up way too much time
here

984
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
here
 

985
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,150
here
so what you got going on uh this weekend

986
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
so what you got going on uh this weekend
 

987
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,830
so what you got going on uh this weekend
i've been uh yesterday and today

988
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
i've been uh yesterday and today
 

989
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,669
