a note for you uh peter about um
about docker versus virtual machine

40
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
about docker versus virtual machine
 

41
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,670
about docker versus virtual machine
so it turns out that docker allows you

42
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
so it turns out that docker allows you
 

43
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,349
so it turns out that docker allows you
to docker will

44
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
to docker will
 

45
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,789
to docker will
only stay active as long as there is a

46
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
only stay active as long as there is a
 

47
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,990
only stay active as long as there is a
process

48
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
process
 

49
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,789
process
to run inside of docker so that works

50
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
to run inside of docker so that works
 

51
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,590
to run inside of docker so that works
great

52
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
great
 

53
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,870
great
if you if you've got a process that

54
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
if you if you've got a process that
 

55
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,310
if you if you've got a process that
that runs uh all the time but

56
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
that runs uh all the time but
 

57
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,310
that runs uh all the time but
for what i'm trying to do all i'm trying

58
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
for what i'm trying to do all i'm trying
 

59
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,990
for what i'm trying to do all i'm trying
to do is run a script

60
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
to do is run a script
 

61
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,670
to do is run a script
and since all i'm trying to do is run a

62
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
and since all i'm trying to do is run a
 

63
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,149
and since all i'm trying to do is run a
script docker won't stay alive

64
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
script docker won't stay alive
 

65
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,350
script docker won't stay alive
for that you'd have to set up like a web

66
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
for that you'd have to set up like a web
 

67
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,109
for that you'd have to set up like a web
server or something to

68
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
server or something to
 

69
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,109
server or something to
to um keep the docker image alive

70
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
to um keep the docker image alive
 

71
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,350
to um keep the docker image alive
that's not really what i wanted to do so

72
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
that's not really what i wanted to do so

85
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,789
skips or anything like that it's
probably because of that but i've got

86
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
probably because of that but i've got
 

87
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,789
probably because of that but i've got
plenty of memory plenty of cpu on this

88
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
plenty of memory plenty of cpu on this
 

89
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,910
plenty of memory plenty of cpu on this
machine so

90
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
machine so
 

91
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,429
machine so
it's not even straight it's not even

92
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
it's not even straight it's not even
 

93

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,910
need anything like
that kind of memory for the process that

108
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
that kind of memory for the process that
 

109
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,430
that kind of memory for the process that
i'm trying to run so

110

129
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,110
but i i decided to do gooey just because
i like gui

uh it will be it will be a virtual
machine i'm going to keep messing with

138
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
machine i'm going to keep messing with
 

139

could not find
 

147
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,509
could not find
the um virtual machine uh

148
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
the um virtual machine uh
 

149
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,710
the um virtual machine uh
uh uh uh install files in the repository

150
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
uh uh uh install files in the repository
 

151
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,030
uh uh uh install files in the repository
uh and then i looked up some um i looked

the
 

159
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,910
the
it really isn't the repository i just

160

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
now one of the things that you can do
 

215
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,870
now one of the things that you can do
with this

216
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
with this
 

217
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,870
with this
if you um if you install a um

218
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
if you um if you install a um
 

219
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,030
if you um if you install a um
a uh a handy dandy

220
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
a uh a handy dandy
 

221
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,070
a uh a handy dandy
bit of um hardware

222
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
bit of um hardware
 

223
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,230
bit of um hardware
let me see if i can show that to you

224
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
let me see if i can show that to you
 

225
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,189
let me see if i can show that to you
real quick

226
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199

 

227
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,430

you install this handy dandy bit of

228
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
you install this handy dandy bit of
 

229
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,790
you install this handy dandy bit of
hardware

230
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
hardware
 

231
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,990
hardware
and what you have is

232
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
and what you have is
 

233
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,430
and what you have is
cpm you can now run cpm on this laptop

234
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
cpm you can now run cpm on this laptop
 

235
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,550
cpm you can now run cpm on this laptop
which works really really great except

236
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
which works really really great except
 

237
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,029
which works really really great except
that

238
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
that
 

239
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,790
that
the laptop has a lcd screen

240
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
the laptop has a lcd screen
 

241
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,029
the laptop has a lcd screen
of 40 characters by eight lines

242
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
of 40 characters by eight lines
 

243
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,230
of 40 characters by eight lines
cpm works with that but it's not

244
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
cpm works with that but it's not
 

245
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,469
cpm works with that but it's not
wonderful it's not the best option

246
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
wonderful it's not the best option
 

247
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,629
wonderful it's not the best option
so what i ended up doing was

248
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
so what i ended up doing was
 

249
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,990
so what i ended up doing was
um i could i could run it on the lcd

250
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
um i could i could run it on the lcd
 

251
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,230
um i could i could run it on the lcd
that would be no problem whatsoever i

252
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
that would be no problem whatsoever i
 

253
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,550
that would be no problem whatsoever i
could absolutely do that

254
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
could absolutely do that
 

255
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,990
could absolutely do that
but what i ended up doing and it's not

256
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
but what i ended up doing and it's not
 

257
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,310
but what i ended up doing and it's not
plugged up right now and i may do that

258
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
plugged up right now and i may do that
 

259
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,390
plugged up right now and i may do that
in just a minute but the idea is you

260
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
in just a minute but the idea is you
 

261
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,990
in just a minute but the idea is you
plug in a serial connection

262
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
plug in a serial connection
 

263
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,950
plug in a serial connection
on here to the serial connection on

264
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
on here to the serial connection on
 

265
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,870
on here to the serial connection on
this the db9

266
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
this the db9
 

267
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,070
this the db9
and then you power this thing up

268
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
and then you power this thing up
 

269
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,350
and then you power this thing up
with a usb wall wart

270
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
with a usb wall wart
 

271
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,469
with a usb wall wart
basically and this

272
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
basically and this
 

273
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,110
basically and this
is a vt 100 screen

274
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
is a vt 100 screen
 

275
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,510
is a vt 100 screen
uh driver or well not an emulator

276
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
uh driver or well not an emulator
 

277
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,710
uh driver or well not an emulator
because it's hardware isn't it

278
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
because it's hardware isn't it
 

279
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,469
because it's hardware isn't it
so what happens is

280
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:17,479

 

281
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,390

19 200 board

282
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
19 200 board
 

283
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,830
19 200 board
you can't pick anymore no

284
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
you can't pick anymore no
 

285
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,150
you can't pick anymore no
probably but 192 is quite fast enough

286
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
probably but 192 is quite fast enough
 

287
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,270
probably but 192 is quite fast enough
for me thanks very much

288

for me thanks very much
 

289

faster than that

292
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
faster than that
 

293
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,909
faster than that

here
 

297
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,350
here
just won't drive the screen any faster

298
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
just won't drive the screen any faster
 

299
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,870
just won't drive the screen any faster
oh yeah

i didn't build i didn't build this kit i
didn't design this kit

326

didn't design this kit
 

327
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,029
didn't design this kit
the kit came from a fella in australia

328
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
the kit came from a fella in australia
 

329

331
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,589

and then it was tweaked by a another

332
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
and then it was tweaked by a another
 

333
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,230
and then it was tweaked by a another

who took the original design and then

338
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
who took the original design and then
 

339
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,670
who took the original design and then
tweaked it a little bit

340
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
tweaked it a little bit
 

341
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,550
tweaked it a little bit
to put the rs232 port on it so that it

342
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
to put the rs232 port on it so that it
 

343
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,390
to put the rs232 port on it so that it
would be much more easy to connect the

344
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
would be much more easy to connect the
 

345

that you have to be extra ordinarily

422
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
that you have to be extra ordinarily
 

423
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,829
that you have to be extra ordinarily
careful with you could not

careful with you could not
 

425
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,230
careful with you could not
just you know bump it around like you

426
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
just you know bump it around like you
 

427
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,389
just you know bump it around like you
can hard disks of today

428
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
can hard disks of today
 

429
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,150
can hard disks of today
because if you did that you basically

430
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
because if you did that you basically
 

431
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,670
because if you did that you basically
trashed it it was done

432
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
trashed it it was done
 

433
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,110
trashed it it was done
yeah um and as i recall

434
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
yeah um and as i recall
 

435
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,509
yeah um and as i recall
i think that all you could do with those

436
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
i think that all you could do with those
 

437
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,350
i think that all you could do with those
hard disks was partition it

438
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
hard disks was partition it
 

439
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,470
hard disks was partition it
so it didn't matter how big it was

440
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
so it didn't matter how big it was
 

441
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,990
so it didn't matter how big it was
you could only do 8 megabytes

442
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
you could only do 8 megabytes
 

443
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,430
you could only do 8 megabytes
per partition on the hard drive now

444
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
per partition on the hard drive now
 

445
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,150
per partition on the hard drive now
eight megabytes is a huge amount of hard

446
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
eight megabytes is a huge amount of hard
 

447
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,350

455
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,550

eight meg in total so if you used

456
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
eight meg in total so if you used
 

457
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,910
eight meg in total so if you used
yeah if you use both sides that would be

458
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
yeah if you use both sides that would be
 

459
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,150
yeah if you use both sides that would be
four megabytes per side um

460
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
four megabytes per side um

pascal

490
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
pascal
 

491
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,430
pascal
and you use lazarus in your case on on

492
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
and you use lazarus in your case on on
 

493
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,470
and you use lazarus in your case on on
windows

494
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
windows
 

495
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,230
windows
well back in the day the solution was

496
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
well back in the day the solution was
 

497
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,150
well back in the day the solution was
uh back in the day the solution was

498
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
uh back in the day the solution was
 

499
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,350
uh back in the day the solution was
turbo pascal

500
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
turbo pascal
 

501
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,030
turbo pascal
on cpm yeah did you really

502
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
on cpm yeah did you really
 

503
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,630
on cpm yeah did you really
yeah yeah so so this unit

504
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
yeah yeah so so this unit
 

505
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,670
yeah yeah so so this unit
this this um uh model 100

506
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
this this um uh model 100
 

507
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,870
this this um uh model 100
that i've that i left a cover on

508
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
that i've that i left a cover on
 

509
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,030
that i've that i left a cover on
this model 100 has an 8085

510
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
this model 100 has an 8085
 

511
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,750
this model 100 has an 8085
in it or more specifically an 80c85

512
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
in it or more specifically an 80c85
 

513
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,750
in it or more specifically an 80c85
which is a uh which is a successor

514
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
which is a uh which is a successor
 

515
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,750
which is a uh which is a successor
to the 8080. the 8080

516
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
to the 8080. the 8080
 

517
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,829
to the 8080. the 8080
is what cpm was originally written for

518
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
is what cpm was originally written for
 

519
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,030
is what cpm was originally written for
but what i did not know was that

520
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
but what i did not know was that
 

521
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,750
but what i did not know was that
well i knew that my capro had a z80 in

522
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
well i knew that my capro had a z80 in
 

523
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,949
well i knew that my capro had a z80 in
it

524
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
it
 

525
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,590
it
but what i thought was that the there

526
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
but what i thought was that the there
 

527
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,190
but what i thought was that the there
was the 8080

528
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
was the 8080
 

529
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,069
was the 8080
then the 8085 and then the z80 followed

530
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
then the 8085 and then the z80 followed
 

531
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,110
then the 8085 and then the z80 followed
after that but that's not the case

532
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
after that but that's not the case
 

533
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,870
after that but that's not the case
the 8080 is was the

534
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
the 8080 is was the
 

535
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,069
the 8080 is was the
initial cpu then the 8086

536
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
initial cpu then the 8086
 

537
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,269
initial cpu then the 8086
correction the 8085

538
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
correction the 8085
 

539
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,389
correction the 8085
was based off the 8080

540
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
was based off the 8080
 

541
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,590
was based off the 8080
and added something like 10

542
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
and added something like 10
 

543
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,150
and added something like 10
instructions to the 8080.

544
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
instructions to the 8080.
 

545
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,550
instructions to the 8080.
then as it turned what turned out to

546
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
then as it turned what turned out to
 

547
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,509
then as it turned what turned out to
have happened is

548
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
have happened is
 

549
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,150
have happened is
the z80 came along that was also based

550
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
the z80 came along that was also based
 

551
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,750
the z80 came along that was also based
on the 808.5

552
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
on the 808.5
 

553
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,150
on the 808.5
they implemented a different set of 10

554
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
they implemented a different set of 10
 

555
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,509
they implemented a different set of 10
instructions

556
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
instructions
 

557
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,230
instructions
so if you have some software for the 8

558
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
so if you have some software for the 8
 

559
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,430
so if you have some software for the 8
for the z80

560
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
for the z80
 

561
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,710
for the z80
it will not run on the 808.5

562
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
it will not run on the 808.5
 

563
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,949
it will not run on the 808.5
if you have software for the 808.5 it

564
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
if you have software for the 808.5 it
 

565
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:53,590
if you have software for the 808.5 it
will not run on the z800s

566
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
will not run on the z800s
 

567
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,310
will not run on the z800s
[Music]

568
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320

 

569
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,389

yep i know it i know it i used to have

570
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
yep i know it i know it i used to have
 

571
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,509
yep i know it i know it i used to have
them in australia

572
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
them in australia
 

573
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,550
them in australia
yeah yeah i'm probably dead yet uh

574
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
yeah yeah i'm probably dead yet uh
 

575
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,829
yeah yeah i'm probably dead yet uh
did the 8080 was the one the first pcs

576
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
did the 8080 was the one the first pcs
 

577
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,829
did the 8080 was the one the first pcs
use the 8080 the

578
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
use the 8080 the
 

579
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,430
use the 8080 the
the 386 jobs or something before 286

580
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
the 386 jobs or something before 286
 

581
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,670
the 386 jobs or something before 286
or something so i think yeah i think

582
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
or something so i think yeah i think
 

583
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,430
or something so i think yeah i think
that's that right

584
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
that's that right
 

585
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,790
that's that right
well i think it goes 8080

586
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
well i think it goes 8080
 

587
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,150
well i think it goes 8080
8085 8086 and then

588
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
8085 8086 and then
 

589
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,590
8085 8086 and then
286 38648 i think

590
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
286 38648 i think
 

591
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,350
286 38648 i think
i think 886's as well got their pc

592
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
i think 886's as well got their pc
 

593
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,670
i think 886's as well got their pc
computers won the first ones

594
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
computers won the first ones
 

595
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,430
computers won the first ones
yeah i'd have to i'd have to look into

596
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
yeah i'd have to i'd have to look into
 

597
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,949
yeah i'd have to i'd have to look into
that i really didn't follow

598
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
that i really didn't follow
 

599
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,870
that i really didn't follow
that i'm not sure but that's a memory

600
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
that i'm not sure but that's a memory
 

601
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,870
that i'm not sure but that's a memory
for about a long time ago yeah

602
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
for about a long time ago yeah
 

603
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,509
for about a long time ago yeah
yeah i did not follow that genealogy

604
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
yeah i did not follow that genealogy
 

605
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,389
yeah i did not follow that genealogy
through but

606
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
through but
 

607
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,350
through but
i believe that it's 80 8080

608
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,360
i believe that it's 80 8080
 

609
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,350
i believe that it's 80 8080
8085 8086

610
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
8085 8086
 

611
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,269
8085 8086
and then 286 3864a you remember the 286

612
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
and then 286 3864a you remember the 286
 

613
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,870
and then 286 3864a you remember the 286
i think it was had the numeric

614
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
i think it was had the numeric
 

615
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,910
i think it was had the numeric
coprocessor

616
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
coprocessor
 

617
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,350
coprocessor
that you have to have if you wanted to

618
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
that you have to have if you wanted to
 

619
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,269
that you have to have if you wanted to
do any kind of math because the

620
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
do any kind of math because the
 

621
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,389
do any kind of math because the
286 or the 386 was not capable of doing

622
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
286 or the 386 was not capable of doing
 

623
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,130
286 or the 386 was not capable of doing
that math

624
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,140
that math
 

625
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,389
that math
[Laughter]

626
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
[Laughter]
 

627
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,710
[Laughter]
that seems weird because a co-pr

628
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
that seems weird because a co-pr
 

629
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,750
that seems weird because a co-pr
microprocessor does math anyways

630
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
microprocessor does math anyways
 

631
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,389
microprocessor does math anyways
it does fixed point or should i say

632
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
it does fixed point or should i say
 

633
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,350
it does fixed point or should i say
integer math

634
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
integer math
 

635
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,430
integer math
the coprocessor was meant for floating

636
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
the coprocessor was meant for floating
 

637
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,470
the coprocessor was meant for floating
point math

638
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
point math
 

639
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,670
point math
okay and you couldn't you back then

640
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
okay and you couldn't you back then
 

641
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,710
okay and you couldn't you back then
if you wanted floating point uh math

642
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
if you wanted floating point uh math
 

643
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,829
if you wanted floating point uh math
you had to do you had to get a

644
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
you had to do you had to get a
 

645
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:29,990
you had to do you had to get a

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
100
 

975
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,390
100
because the model 100 this little

976
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
because the model 100 this little
 

977
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,310
because the model 100 this little
beastie right here

978
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320
beastie right here
 

979
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,590
beastie right here
is a uh it had 32k

980
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
is a uh it had 32k
 

981
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,630
is a uh it had 32k
of ram a 32k of rom

982
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
of ram a 32k of rom
 

983
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,630
of ram a 32k of rom
so the only way that it could work would

984
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
so the only way that it could work would
 

985
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,230
so the only way that it could work would
be to um

986
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
be to um
 

987
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,549
be to um
would be to replace the ram and the rom

988
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
would be to replace the ram and the rom
 

989
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,070
would be to replace the ram and the rom
with uh with another

990
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
with uh with another
 

991
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,070
with uh with another
with with other memory in this case

992
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
with with other memory in this case
 

993
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,190
with with other memory in this case
that's what those little

994
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
that's what those little
 

995
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,310
that's what those little
um option roms do they they replace the

996
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320
um option roms do they they replace the
 

997
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,710
um option roms do they they replace the
uh

998
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
uh
 

999
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,909
uh
the ram and the rom um and the

1000
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
the ram and the rom um and the
 

1001
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,950
the ram and the rom um and the
the onboard memory is not used at all

1002
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
the onboard memory is not used at all
 

1003
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,950
the onboard memory is not used at all
but the native memory that's on that

1004
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
but the native memory that's on that
 

1005
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,390
but the native memory that's on that
unit is not used at all

1006
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
unit is not used at all
 

1007
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,470
unit is not used at all
so yeah that's good fun um

1008
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
so yeah that's good fun um
 

1009
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,710
so yeah that's good fun um
in word star in particular one of the

1010
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
in word star in particular one of the
 

1011
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,070
in word star in particular one of the
things it likes to do

1012
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
things it likes to do
 

1013
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,630
things it likes to do
is because of the way it formats words

1014
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
is because of the way it formats words
 

1015
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,789
is because of the way it formats words
it put it sets the high bit

1016
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
it put it sets the high bit
 

1017
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,590
it put it sets the high bit
on the on the last character of every

1018
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,600
on the on the last character of every
 

1019
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,669
on the on the last character of every
word that's its signal to

1020
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
word that's its signal to
 

1021
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,789
word that's its signal to
justify that you know do incremental

1022
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
justify that you know do incremental
 

1023
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,070
justify that you know do incremental
spacing between each word so

1024
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
spacing between each word so
 

1025
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,909
spacing between each word so
that you get a um not not a ragged line

1026
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
that you get a um not not a ragged line
 

1027
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,549
that you get a um not not a ragged line
ending but

1028
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
ending but
 

1029
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,070
ending but
i guess a straight line ending is what

1030
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
i guess a straight line ending is what
 

1031
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,230
i guess a straight line ending is what
it's called

1032
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
it's called
 

1033
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,669
it's called
but that high bit on the last character

1034
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
but that high bit on the last character
 

1035
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,390
but that high bit on the last character
of each word is what it used

1036
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
of each word is what it used
 

1037
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,190
of each word is what it used
to signal yes this is what i have to

1038
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
to signal yes this is what i have to
 

1039
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,950
to signal yes this is what i have to
this is what i have to do

1040
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
this is what i have to do
 

1041
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,070
this is what i have to do
so one of the problems is

1042
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
so one of the problems is
 

1043
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,990
so one of the problems is
that you know you try and display

1044
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
that you know you try and display
 

1045
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,990
that you know you try and display
a text file that was built with with

1046
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
a text file that was built with with
 

1047
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,110
a text file that was built with with
word star

1048
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
word star
 

1049
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,669
word star
and it's it's full of what looks like

1050
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
and it's it's full of what looks like
 

1051
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,430
and it's it's full of what looks like
control characters because it has the

1052
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
control characters because it has the
 

1053
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,350
control characters because it has the
high bit set on the last character of

1054
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
high bit set on the last character of
 

1055
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,310
high bit set on the last character of
each word

1056
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
each word
 

1057
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,430
each word
so i wrote a simple simple c program

1058
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
so i wrote a simple simple c program
 

1059
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,230
so i wrote a simple simple c program
that literally reads one character one

1060
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
that literally reads one character one
 

1061
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,430
that literally reads one character one
character at a time

1062
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
character at a time
 

1063
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,710
character at a time
off the input file and then if it finds

1064
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:22,720
off the input file and then if it finds
 

1065
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,149
off the input file and then if it finds
the high bit set

1066
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
the high bit set
 

1067
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,310
the high bit set
resets it and then writes that new

1068
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
resets it and then writes that new
 

1069
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,269
resets it and then writes that new
character out

1070
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
character out
 

1071
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,390
character out
why don't you hand you what do you have

1072
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
why don't you hand you what do you have
 

1073
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,810
why don't you hand you what do you have
without

1074
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,820

 

1075
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,950

[Music]

1076
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960

 

1077
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,070

yes that's exactly what i did okay yeah

1078
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
yes that's exactly what i did okay yeah
 

1079
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,870
yes that's exactly what i did okay yeah
exactly what i did yeah yeah and so what

1080
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:44,880
exactly what i did yeah yeah and so what
 

1081
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,149
exactly what i did yeah yeah and so what
you get

1082
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
you get
 

1083
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,310
you get
the output of that program it's

1084
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
the output of that program it's
 

1085
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,430
the output of that program it's
literally

1086
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
literally
 

1087
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,710
literally
like a dozen lines of c it literally

1088
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
like a dozen lines of c it literally
 

1089
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,430
like a dozen lines of c it literally
is that simple and it treats it you

1090
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,440
is that simple and it treats it you
 

1091
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,549
is that simple and it treats it you
treat it like a pipe

1092
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
treat it like a pipe
 

1093
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,789
treat it like a pipe
so you take you you take the input file

1094
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
so you take you you take the input file
 

1095
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,310
so you take you you take the input file
you you

1096
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
you you
 

1097
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,230
you you
pipe it into this program and it acts

1098
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
pipe it into this program and it acts
 

1099
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,990
pipe it into this program and it acts
like a filter or a pipe

1100
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
like a filter or a pipe
 

1101
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,669
like a filter or a pipe
and then it writes the output to stand

1102
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
and then it writes the output to stand
 

1103
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,510
and then it writes the output to stand
it out so

1104
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
it out so
 

1105
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,190
it out so
and then you can just save that to a

1106
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
and then you can just save that to a
 

1107
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,269
and then you can just save that to a
regular a regular file if you like

1108
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
regular a regular file if you like
 

1109
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,590
regular a regular file if you like
so that works like a charm what comes

1110
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
so that works like a charm what comes
 

1111
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,510
so that works like a charm what comes
out the other end is just plain old text

1112
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
out the other end is just plain old text
 

1113
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,789
out the other end is just plain old text
so i doesn't matter if now it is

1114
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
so i doesn't matter if now it is
 

1115
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,510
so i doesn't matter if now it is
possible

1116
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
possible
 

1117
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,750
possible
to uh to make word

1118
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
to uh to make word
 

1119
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,070
to uh to make word
use what's called non-document mode and

1120
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
use what's called non-document mode and
 

1121
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,430
use what's called non-document mode and
i won't put those in but i keep

1122
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
i won't put those in but i keep
 

1123
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,549
i won't put those in but i keep
forgetting to do that

1124
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559

 

1125
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,830

so i use that i use that little pipe

1126
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
so i use that i use that little pipe
 

1127
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,110
so i use that i use that little pipe
real real simple

1128
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120

 

1129
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,870

so peter what have you been up to

1130
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
so peter what have you been up to
 

1131
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:49,590
so peter what have you been up to
i

1132
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600

 

1133
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,190

you just did a whole bunch of work on

1134
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
you just did a whole bunch of work on
 

1135
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,669
you just did a whole bunch of work on
