connect to um
cal dab or card carddav um i could keep

90
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
cal dab or card carddav um i could keep
 

91

checking for updates and they still have

92
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
checking for updates and they still have
 

93
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,310

00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
no way of
 

95
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,190
no way of
making that work uh talked about the

96
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
making that work uh talked about the
 

97
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,550
making that work uh talked about the
power outage

98
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
power outage
 

99
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,149
power outage
you remember a couple of weeks ago i

100
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
you remember a couple of weeks ago i
 

101
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,789
you remember a couple of weeks ago i
talked about that client server process

102
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
talked about that client server process
 

103
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,430
talked about that client server process
that i was doing encrypt and decrypt and

104
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
that i was doing encrypt and decrypt and
 

105
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,630
that i was doing encrypt and decrypt and
all that fun stuff

106
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
all that fun stuff
 

107
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,430
all that fun stuff
yes i never did figure out how to how to

108
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
yes i never did figure out how to how to
 

109
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,869
yes i never did figure out how to how to
fix that i still get

110
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
fix that i still get
 

111
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,670
fix that i still get
intermittent errors all the time i still

112
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
intermittent errors all the time i still
 

113
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,470
intermittent errors all the time i still
haven't figured out how to fix it

114
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
haven't figured out how to fix it
 

115
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,030
haven't figured out how to fix it
i even looked at the test harness that

116
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
i even looked at the test harness that
 

117
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,110
i even looked at the test harness that
they use you know the testing

118
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
they use you know the testing
 

119
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,430
they use you know the testing
uh uh the test code that they use to

120
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
uh uh the test code that they use to
 

121
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,869
uh uh the test code that they use to
verify the library

122
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
verify the library
 

123
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,630
verify the library
i'm doing exactly the same as what they

124
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
i'm doing exactly the same as what they
 

125
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,309
i'm doing exactly the same as what they
do so

126
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
do so
 

127
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,830
do so
i don't know how their test harness

128
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
i don't know how their test harness
 

129
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,670
i don't know how their test harness
passes every time because it doesn't

130
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
passes every time because it doesn't
 

131
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,070
passes every time because it doesn't
pass

132
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
pass
 

133
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,589
pass
much my my code doesn't pass every time

134
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
much my my code doesn't pass every time
 

135
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,869
much my my code doesn't pass every time
so i don't know what the deal is with

136
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
so i don't know what the deal is with
 

137
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,390
so i don't know what the deal is with
that

138
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
that
 

139
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,949
that
um we've talked about we talked about

um we've talked about we talked about
 

141
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,869
um we've talked about we talked about
code coverage last time did anyone have

142
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
code coverage last time did anyone have
 

143
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,309
code coverage last time did anyone have
any questions about that has anyone

144
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
any questions about that has anyone
 

145
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,990
any questions about that has anyone
tried any of that

146
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000

 

147

00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
it looks like a dsl filter i know that's
 

157
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,110
it looks like a dsl filter i know that's
what it looks like but it is actually a

network
 

161
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,910
network
to usbc

to usbc
 

163
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,350
to usbc
ah okay connector okay and the reason

164
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
ah okay connector okay and the reason
 

165
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,550
ah okay connector okay and the reason
i got it was to be able to connect that

166
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
i got it was to be able to connect that
 

167
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,750
i got it was to be able to connect that
ah their cell booth

1074
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
operating system it was uh multitasking
 

1075
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,669
operating system it was uh multitasking
and it was mpm is

1076
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
and it was mpm is
 

1077
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,630
and it was mpm is
cpm not so much but mpm was yeah

1078
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
cpm not so much but mpm was yeah
 

1079
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,830
cpm not so much but mpm was yeah
absolutely

1080
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
absolutely
 

1081
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,630
absolutely
now i am curious about how it would have

1082
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
now i am curious about how it would have
 

1083
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,470
now i am curious about how it would have
developed if it had stayed around if

1084
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
developed if it had stayed around if
 

1085
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,470
developed if it had stayed around if
microsoft hadn't shouldered their way in

1086
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
microsoft hadn't shouldered their way in
 

1087
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,190
microsoft hadn't shouldered their way in
and

1088
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
and
 

1089
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,190
and
and walked everything up but um

1090
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
and walked everything up but um
 

1091
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,070
and walked everything up but um
i was i'm curious to see how cpm and npm

1092
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,080
i was i'm curious to see how cpm and npm
 

1093
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,430
i was i'm curious to see how cpm and npm
would have developed

1094
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
would have developed
 

1095
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,590
would have developed
with directories subdirectories all that

1096
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
with directories subdirectories all that
 

1097
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,710
with directories subdirectories all that
because you can't

1098
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
because you can't
 

1099
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,950
because you can't
you actually don't have directory

1100
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
you actually don't have directory
 

1101
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,510
you actually don't have directory
support in cpm as it stands

1102
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
support in cpm as it stands
 

1103
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,070
support in cpm as it stands
as it stood then nearly what 40 years

1104
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
as it stood then nearly what 40 years
 

1105
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,590
as it stood then nearly what 40 years
ago now

1106
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
ago now
 

1107
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,549
ago now
and as it's as it stands now you only

1108
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
and as it's as it stands now you only
 

1109
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,669
and as it's as it stands now you only
have user numbers

1110
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
have user numbers
 

1111
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,350
have user numbers
you could you have 16 user numbers

1112
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
you could you have 16 user numbers
 

1113
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,350
you could you have 16 user numbers
ranging from 0 through 15

1114
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
ranging from 0 through 15
 

1115
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,190
ranging from 0 through 15
and that's it that's all you have in the

1116
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
and that's it that's all you have in the
 

1117
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,789
and that's it that's all you have in the
way of directory support

1118
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
way of directory support
 

1119
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,070
way of directory support
so yeah and then the first uh the first

1120
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
so yeah and then the first uh the first
 

1121
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,950
so yeah and then the first uh the first
one or two versions of ms-dos didn't

1122
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
one or two versions of ms-dos didn't
 

1123
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,750
one or two versions of ms-dos didn't
have a

1124
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
have a
 

1125
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,230
have a
folder support either it was the router

1126
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
folder support either it was the router
 

1127
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,590
folder support either it was the router
yeah and that was it

1128
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
yeah and that was it
 

1129
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,590
yeah and that was it
i did not know that huh okay well

1130
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
i did not know that huh okay well
 

1131
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,510
i did not know that huh okay well
you have to be very careful you still do

1132
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
you have to be very careful you still do
 

1133
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,430
you have to be very careful you still do
with cpm you have to be very careful

1134
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
with cpm you have to be very careful
 

1135
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,070
with cpm you have to be very careful
with the

1136
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
with the
 

1137
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,510
with the
um uh uh with the directory

1138
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
um uh uh with the directory
 

1139
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,990
um uh uh with the directory
because when you build a disk you

1140
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
because when you build a disk you
 

1141
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,990
because when you build a disk you
specify how many

1142
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
specify how many
 

1143
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,909
specify how many
blocks um your disk your directory took

1144
00:22:59,909 --> 00:22:59,919
blocks um your disk your directory took
 

1145
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,549
blocks um your disk your directory took
up

1146
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
up
 

1147
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,310
up
on the um on the on the disk

1148
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
on the um on the on the disk
 

1149
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,390
on the um on the on the disk

things
 

1313
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,510
things
but it would embrace it it was a very

but it would embrace it it was a very
 

1315
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,430
but it would embrace it it was a very
sensitive you know

1316
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
sensitive you know
 

1317
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,350
sensitive you know
you have to perform the what's up with

1318
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
you have to perform the what's up with
 

1319
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,110
you have to perform the what's up with
the material to get the thing to move

1320
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
the material to get the thing to move
 

1321
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,630
the material to get the thing to move
anything you know

1322
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
anything you know
 

1323
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,590
anything you know
yeah yeah but that you just have to

1324
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
yeah yeah but that you just have to
 

1325
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,549
yeah yeah but that you just have to
tickle it and it goes

1326
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
tickle it and it goes
 

1327
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,430
tickle it and it goes
so i'll i will make sure peter to get

1328
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
so i'll i will make sure peter to get
 

1329
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,909
so i'll i will make sure peter to get
that

1330
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
that
 

1331
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,070
that
youtube link out of discord and i'll

1332
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
youtube link out of discord and i'll
 

1333
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,830
youtube link out of discord and i'll
make sure it goes in the notes

1334
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
make sure it goes in the notes
 

1335
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,269
make sure it goes in the notes
on uh below on youtube and on cat five

1336
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279
on uh below on youtube and on cat five
 

1337
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:49,909
on uh below on youtube and on cat five
so that

1338
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
so that
 

1339
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,909
so that
so that they can go anyone who's

1340
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:51,919
so that they can go anyone who's
 

1341
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,590
so that they can go anyone who's
interested can go find it it's

1342
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
interested can go find it it's
 

1343
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,470
interested can go find it it's
very useful yeah i mean i mean for all

1344
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
very useful yeah i mean i mean for all
 

1345
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,310
very useful yeah i mean i mean for all
sorts of products and things you know

1346
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
sorts of products and things you know
 

1347
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,510
sorts of products and things you know
i've got great law ideas for it

1348
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
i've got great law ideas for it
 

1349
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,269
i've got great law ideas for it
that somebody could could get put

1350
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
that somebody could could get put
 

1351
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:14,230
that somebody could could get put
together themselves or not

1352
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240

 

1353
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,230

or whatever it was okay and then and

1354
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
or whatever it was okay and then and
 

1355
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,510
or whatever it was okay and then and
then you get a

1356
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
then you get a
 

1357
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,950
then you get a
a leader as well the usb lead

1358
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
a leader as well the usb lead
 

1359
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,190
a leader as well the usb lead
at the back of it which you plug in

1360
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
at the back of it which you plug in
 

1361
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,710
at the back of it which you plug in
which it gives you your five volts

1362
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
which it gives you your five volts
 

1363
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,230
which it gives you your five volts
there's also a blue

1364
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,240
there's also a blue
 

1365
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,389
there's also a blue
a connector which is also connected to

1366
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:28,399
a connector which is also connected to
 

1367
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,669
a connector which is also connected to
the usb

1368
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
the usb
 

1369
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,029
the usb
leader as well and yeah and uh well

1370
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
leader as well and yeah and uh well
 

1371
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,789
leader as well and yeah and uh well
that gives you five volts you could put

1372
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
that gives you five volts you could put
 

1373
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,549
that gives you five volts you could put
five volts into there

1374
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
five volts into there
 

1375
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,909
five volts into there
uh i i would use a voltage regulator

1376
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
uh i i would use a voltage regulator
 

1377
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,470
uh i i would use a voltage regulator
uh if you're running from twelve uh and

1378
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
uh if you're running from twelve uh and

1386
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:50,399
have you heard of the uh ubik voltage
 

1387
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,909
have you heard of the uh ubik voltage
regulators have you ever seen those

1388
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:51,919
regulators have you ever seen those
 

1389
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,909

you can run it on the battery you can

1410
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
you can run it on the battery you can
 

1411
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,110
you can run it on the battery you can
always say if you did five volts

1412
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
always say if you did five volts
 

1413
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,590
always say if you did five volts
output you can almost run six volts

1414
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
output you can almost run six volts
 

1415
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,830
output you can almost run six volts
input to it and uh they still give you

1416
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
input to it and uh they still give you
 

1417
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,190
input to it and uh they still give you
five volts

1418
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
five volts
 

1419
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,549

installing a z80 cpu so i could run
turbo pascal but to be honest

1466
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
turbo pascal but to be honest
 

1467
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,870

i don't think i'll do that i think i'll

00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
the 8080 85
 

1477
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,430
the 8080 85
8086 and all that and i thought that it

yes sir
 

1501
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,909
yes sir
does that have a serial connection on it

1502
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
does that have a serial connection on it
 

1503
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,350
does that have a serial connection on it
oh yeah it sure does

1504
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
oh yeah it sure does
 

1505
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,750
oh yeah it sure does
yeah okay that's what drives that's the

1506
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:31,760
yeah okay that's what drives that's the
 

1507
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,750
yeah okay that's what drives that's the
serial connection that drives

1508
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
serial connection that drives
 

1509
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,750
serial connection that drives
the

1510
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760

 

1511
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,710

what you connect your board to yep um is

1512
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
what you connect your board to yep um is
 

1513
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,070
what you connect your board to yep um is
there a possibility of getting a

1514
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
there a possibility of getting a
 

1515
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,669
there a possibility of getting a
splitter for that so you could connect

1516
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:45,679
splitter for that so you could connect
 

1517
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,029
splitter for that so you could connect
like a

1518
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
like a
 

1519
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,070
like a
a serial hard drive to it no

1520
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
a serial hard drive to it no
 

1521
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,149
a serial hard drive to it no
but there is a uh a bcr a barcode reader

1522
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
but there is a uh a bcr a barcode reader
 

1523
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,909
but there is a uh a bcr a barcode reader
port that you can bang

1524
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:55,919
port that you can bang
 

1525
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,830
port that you can bang
to actually produce serial output and

1526
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:57,840
to actually produce serial output and
 

1527
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,269
to actually produce serial output and
that frees up your

1528
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
that frees up your
 

1529
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,830
that frees up your
regular serial port for so you can

1530
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
regular serial port for so you can
 

1531
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,070
regular serial port for so you can
connect a serial hard drive to it

1532
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
connect a serial hard drive to it
 

1533
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,710
connect a serial hard drive to it
uh i can and i don't i don't have it

1534
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
uh i can and i don't i don't have it
 

1535
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,269
uh i can and i don't i don't have it
with me

1536
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
with me
 

1537
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,190
with me
right now but i actually use that

1538
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
right now but i actually use that
 

1539
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,110
right now but i actually use that
already it's called a

1540
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
already it's called a
 

1541
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,590
already it's called a
it's gonna sound rude peter so be quiet

1542
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
it's gonna sound rude peter so be quiet
 

1543
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,230
it's gonna sound rude peter so be quiet
it's called a nad's box

1544
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
it's called a nad's box
 

1545
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,590
it's called a nad's box
in a ds box new age

1546
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:19,600
in a ds box new age
 

1547
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,710
in a ds box new age
new age digital storage box

1548
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
new age digital storage box
 

1549
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,430
new age digital storage box
so stop it peter

1550
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440

 

1551
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,430

peter would react i knew peter would

1552
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:31,440
peter would react i knew peter would
 

1553
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,789
peter would react i knew peter would
react like that

1554
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
react like that
 

1555
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,990
react like that
so and what it is is it

1556
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,000
so and what it is is it
 

1557
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,549
so and what it is is it
it connects to the serial port just like

1558
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
it connects to the serial port just like
 

1559
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,110
it connects to the serial port just like
the

1560
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
the
 

1561
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,149
the
the disk drive does that comes that you

1562
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
the disk drive does that comes that you
 

1563
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:42,789
the disk drive does that comes that you
can buy

1564
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,799
can buy
 

1565
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,509
can buy
with that unit okay it uses the serial

1566
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
with that unit okay it uses the serial
 

1567
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,389
with that unit okay it uses the serial
port

1568
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
port
 

1569
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,070
port
and instead of using a three and a half

1570
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
and instead of using a three and a half
 

1571
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,750
and instead of using a three and a half
inch floppy disk um

1572
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:49,760
inch floppy disk um
 

1573
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,190
inch floppy disk um
you use this sd card reader instead so

1574
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,200
you use this sd card reader instead so
 

1575
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,950
you use this sd card reader instead so
yep that's how it works and it works

1576
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
yep that's how it works and it works
 

1577
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,710
yep that's how it works and it works
like a charm

1578
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
like a charm
 

1579
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,830
like a charm
like a 256
