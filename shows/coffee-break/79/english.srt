you
 

47
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,349
you
as you saw doug it has the um serial

00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
as you saw doug it has the um serial
 

49
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,069
as you saw doug it has the um serial

for uh for storage
well i started messing with

60
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
well i started messing with
 

61
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,070
well i started messing with
the handy dandy display that i got

62
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
the handy dandy display that i got
 

63
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,950
the handy dandy display that i got
on the perspex cover now let me deploy

64
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
on the perspex cover now let me deploy
 

65
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,310
on the perspex cover now let me deploy
this thing

66
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
this thing
 

67
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,310
this thing
and so my thought was i mean this is

68
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
and so my thought was i mean this is
 

69
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,590
and so my thought was i mean this is
jackie is all get out

70
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
jackie is all get out
 

71
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,230
jackie is all get out
i'm sorry but my thought was that i

72
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
i'm sorry but my thought was that i
 

73
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,109
i'm sorry but my thought was that i
would just put the model 100 right there

74
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
would just put the model 100 right there
 

75
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,149
would just put the model 100 right there
okay right and i would

76
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
okay right and i would
 

77
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,429
okay right and i would
put the um you see i've used shipping

78
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
put the um you see i've used shipping
 

79
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,230
put the um you see i've used shipping
tape

80
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
tape
 

81
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,429
tape
to uh to attach the display to the

82
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
to uh to attach the display to the
 

83
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,789
to uh to attach the display to the
perspex board

84
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
perspex board
 

85
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,149
perspex board
and i did that just to mock it up to see

86
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
and i did that just to mock it up to see
 

87
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,429
and i did that just to mock it up to see
how well it fits right so this is the

88
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
how well it fits right so this is the
 

89
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,590
how well it fits right so this is the
vt-100 you've already seen that

90
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
vt-100 you've already seen that
 

91
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,190
vt-100 you've already seen that
right um and then the model 100 will

92
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
right um and then the model 100 will
 

93
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,069
right um and then the model 100 will
well it was about what about legs on on

94
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
well it was about what about legs on on
 

95
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,950
well it was about what about legs on on
something to make it 45 degrees you know

96
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
something to make it 45 degrees you know
 

97
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,950
something to make it 45 degrees you know
so you got a leg at the back so you can

98
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
so you got a leg at the back so you can
 

99
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,309
so you got a leg at the back so you can
have about 45 degrees

100
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
have about 45 degrees
 

101
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,910
have about 45 degrees
so yeah so the idea is that um

102
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
so yeah so the idea is that um
 

103
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,470
so yeah so the idea is that um
that this is supposed to be on your lap

104
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
that this is supposed to be on your lap
 

105
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,910
that this is supposed to be on your lap
like this laptop

106
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
like this laptop
 

107
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,430
like this laptop
does like the laptop does already right

108
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
does like the laptop does already right
 

109
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,430
does like the laptop does already right
um but

110
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
um but
 

111
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,190
um but
i don't know there's a couple of use

112
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
i don't know there's a couple of use
 

113
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,550
i don't know there's a couple of use
cases for this

114
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
cases for this
 

115
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,070
cases for this
one of the use cases is that i am

116
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
one of the use cases is that i am
 

117
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,430
one of the use cases is that i am
trying to transcribe old

118
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
trying to transcribe old
 

119
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,150
trying to transcribe old
old old documentation that actually came

120
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
old old documentation that actually came
 

121
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,990
old old documentation that actually came
for this machine

122
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000

 

123
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,670

you know stuff that hasn't been

124
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
you know stuff that hasn't been
 

125
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,309
you know stuff that hasn't been
digitized yet

126
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
digitized yet
 

127
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,430
digitized yet
so

128
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440

 

129
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,470

yeah transcribe it to a document

130
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
yeah transcribe it to a document
 

131
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,309
yeah transcribe it to a document
to a text formatting language like tech

132
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
to a text formatting language like tech
 

133
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,070
to a text formatting language like tech
and then use the main machine to

134
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
and then use the main machine to
 

135
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,710
and then use the main machine to
actually process it create pdfs ebooks

136
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
actually process it create pdfs ebooks
 

137
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,509
actually process it create pdfs ebooks
whatever i need to create from that

138
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
whatever i need to create from that
 

139
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,149
whatever i need to create from that
another use case is literally just

140
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
another use case is literally just
 

141
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,710
another use case is literally just
to write write notes right documents

142
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
to write write notes right documents
 

143
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,430
to write write notes right documents
right

144
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
right
 

145
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,110
right
books whatever right um

146
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
books whatever right um
 

147
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,270
books whatever right um
and this might work for that

148
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
and this might work for that
 

149
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,309
and this might work for that
use case except the problem i've got is

150
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
use case except the problem i've got is
 

151
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:20,790
use case except the problem i've got is
that

152
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
that
 

153
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,990
that
this all looks all nice and and easy now

154
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
this all looks all nice and and easy now
 

155
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,350
this all looks all nice and and easy now

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,070

here so i've got like a three foot

168
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
here so i've got like a three foot
 

169
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,630
here so i've got like a three foot
serial cable that runs from here to here

170
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
serial cable that runs from here to here
 

171
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,550
serial cable that runs from here to here
then i've got a vga cable that's three

172
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
then i've got a vga cable that's three
 

173
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,509
then i've got a vga cable that's three
or four feet runs from here

174
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
or four feet runs from here
 

175
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,949
or four feet runs from here
to here in fact that's the cable right

176
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
to here in fact that's the cable right
 

177
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,309
to here in fact that's the cable right
there

178
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
there
 

179
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,030
there
then i've got to run power from here

180
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040

 

181
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,190

um uh uh as long as nothing's connected
but uh i don't know if you saw that i

258
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
but uh i don't know if you saw that i
 

259
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,110
but uh i don't know if you saw that i
would have to connect

260
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
would have to connect
 

261
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,230
would have to connect
serial rs232 from here

262
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
serial rs232 from here
 

263

to here right
 

265
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,590
to here right
then i would have to connect vga

266
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
then i would have to connect vga
 

267
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,670
then i would have to connect vga
from here

268
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
then i would have to connect let's see
 

273
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,790
then i would have to connect let's see
power

274
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
power
 

275
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,430
power
from here to some source of five or six

276

from here to some source of five or six
volts

278
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
volts
 

279
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,990
volts
power from some source from here to some

280
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
power from some source from here to some
 

281
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,790
power from some source from here to some
source of

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
source of
 

283
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,469
source of
um 12 volts and power from

284
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
um 12 volts and power from
 

285
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,350
um 12 volts and power from
here or two here from some source of um

here or two here from some source of um
 

287
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,710
here or two here from some source of um
six volts and so it's just all the power

288
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
six volts and so it's just all the power
 

289
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,469
six volts and so it's just all the power
just all the power requirements it just

290
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
just all the power requirements it just
 

291
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:26,790
just all the power requirements it just
get

292
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
get
 

293
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,990
get
it it's just not very portable anymore

294
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
it it's just not very portable anymore
 

295
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,990
it it's just not very portable anymore
at all i mean you could you could run

296
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
at all i mean you could you could run
 

297
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,270
at all i mean you could you could run
the uh

298
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
the uh
 

299
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,870
the uh
the five volts of the twelve volt

300
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
the five volts of the twelve volt
 

301
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,189
the five volts of the twelve volt
through a couple regularly true

302
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
through a couple regularly true
 

303
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,510
through a couple regularly true
that's true i've certainly considered

304
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
that's true i've certainly considered
 

305
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,150
that's true i've certainly considered
that and so boo look at my handiwork man

306
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
that and so boo look at my handiwork man
 

307
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,029
that and so boo look at my handiwork man
i mean it's all

308
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
i mean it's all
 

309
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,350
i mean it's all
it's all shipping it's all shipping tape

310
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
it's all shipping it's all shipping tape
 

311
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,990
it's all shipping it's all shipping tape
just to hold it in place right but

312
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
just to hold it in place right but
 

313
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,589
just to hold it in place right but
you've got to start somewhere right

314
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
you've got to start somewhere right
 

315
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,510
you've got to start somewhere right
the whole point is to see if you can

316
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
the whole point is to see if you can
 

317
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,430
the whole point is to see if you can
make it work is to see if it's even

318
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
make it work is to see if it's even
 

319
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,629
make it work is to see if it's even
viable is that um the plastic thing is

320
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
viable is that um the plastic thing is
 

321
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,430
viable is that um the plastic thing is
that on all the

322
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
that on all the
 

323
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,189
that on all the
speakers stand where you have some

324
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
speakers stand where you have some
 

325
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,870
speakers stand where you have some
papers while you're

326

papers while you're
 

327
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,510

is that how it works you know yeah with
 

525
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,670
is that how it works you know yeah with
a podium as well you use just four screw

526
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
a podium as well you use just four screw
 

527
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,110
a podium as well you use just four screw
holes to hold it in place

528
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
holes to hold it in place
 

529
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,910
holes to hold it in place
yeah but i've never seen one uh that is

530
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
yeah but i've never seen one uh that is

wouldn't use it now
um and of course there's

546
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
um and of course there's
 

547
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,310
um and of course there's
you know the way i've set this up was

548
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
you know the way i've set this up was
 

549
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,150
you know the way i've set this up was
purely as a mock-up to see if it was

550
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
purely as a mock-up to see if it was
 

551
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,509
purely as a mock-up to see if it was
gonna work for me

552
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
gonna work for me
 

553
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,030
gonna work for me
it's just not going to it's just not

554
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
it's just not going to it's just not
 

555
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,790
it's just not going to it's just not
going to work so

556
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
going to work so
 

557
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,110

i did not suspect
was what i did not realize was that the

562
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
was what i did not realize was that the
 

563
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,710
was what i did not realize was that the
wiring was going to be such a hassle

564
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
wiring was going to be such a hassle
 

565
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,190
wiring was going to be such a hassle
yeah

566
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
yeah
 

567
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,150
yeah
i can mount all the devices nicely if i

568
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
i can mount all the devices nicely if i
 

569
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,590
i can mount all the devices nicely if i
didn't have to wire them up it would be

570
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
didn't have to wire them up it would be
 

571
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,710
didn't have to wire them up it would be
great i wouldn't

572
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
great i wouldn't
 

573
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,550
great i wouldn't
use any space at all and it would be

574
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
use any space at all and it would be
 

575
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,750
use any space at all and it would be
wonderful but

576

it it just isn't gonna work and you
 

579
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:34,790
it it just isn't gonna work and you
very quickly you

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800

 

581
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,750

yeah yeah you soon realize that people

582
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
yeah yeah you soon realize that people
 

583
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,829
yeah yeah you soon realize that people
who designed this thing

584
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
who designed this thing
 

585
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,870
who designed this thing
really thought it through because this

586
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
really thought it through because this
 

587
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,910
really thought it through because this
is a

588
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
is a
 

589
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,710
is a
this thing just stand alone it feels

590
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
this thing just stand alone it feels
 

591
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,110
this thing just stand alone it feels
quite bulky now compared to

592
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
quite bulky now compared to
 

593
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,949
quite bulky now compared to
compared to you know 2020 model

594
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
compared to you know 2020 model
 

595
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,190
compared to you know 2020 model
you know but there's been nothing like

596
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
you know but there's been nothing like
 

597
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,629
you know but there's been nothing like
this since

598
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
this since
 

599
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,710
this since
there's been the 102 which is a later

600
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
there's been the 102 which is a later
 

601
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,670
there's been the 102 which is a later
version of this

602
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
version of this
 

603
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,030
version of this
there was the 200 which is a version

604
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
there was the 200 which is a version
 

605
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,030
there was the 200 which is a version
that has the full-size keyboard but it

606
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
that has the full-size keyboard but it
 

607
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,509
that has the full-size keyboard but it
has the display that folds up

608
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
has the display that folds up
 

609
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,269
has the display that folds up
and that was the precursor to the proper

610
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
and that was the precursor to the proper
 

611
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,030
and that was the precursor to the proper
laptops and you didn't

612
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
laptops and you didn't
 

613
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,710
laptops and you didn't
realize in in those days uh things were

614
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
realize in in those days uh things were
 

615
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,230
realize in in those days uh things were
often still made to last a few

616
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
often still made to last a few
 

617
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,829
often still made to last a few
um ten years

618
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
um ten years
 

619
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,710
um ten years
oh yes this was this was made to last

620
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
oh yes this was this was made to last
 

621
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,710
oh yes this was this was made to last
many many years there is no doubt about

622
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
many many years there is no doubt about
 

623
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,110
many many years there is no doubt about
that

624
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
that
 

625
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,230
that
and it was if you wanted to

626
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
and it was if you wanted to
 

627
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,030
and it was if you wanted to
uh and have the skills you could open it

628
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
uh and have the skills you could open it
 

629
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,949
uh and have the skills you could open it
up and

630
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959

 

631
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,949

switch broken things um broken parts out

632
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
switch broken things um broken parts out
 

633
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,110
switch broken things um broken parts out
for new ones i've done it i've already

634
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
for new ones i've done it i've already
 

635
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,470
for new ones i've done it i've already
done it because

636
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
done it because
 

637
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,629
done it because
this thing has a a three volt

638
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
this thing has a a three volt
 

639
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,069
this thing has a a three volt
memory battery that it its sole

640
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
memory battery that it its sole
 

641
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,470
memory battery that it its sole
job is to keep the memory alive while

642
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
job is to keep the memory alive while
 

643
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,470
job is to keep the memory alive while
you're switching out double a batteries

644
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
you're switching out double a batteries
 

645
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,550
you're switching out double a batteries
out of the out of the unit because it

646
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
out of the out of the unit because it
 

647
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,629
out of the out of the unit because it
runs on four double a batteries

648
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
runs on four double a batteries
 

649
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,389
runs on four double a batteries
so normally six volts

650
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399

 

651
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,629

one question that i have that um yeah

754
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
so yeah i'm i'm trying to fold it up and
 

755
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,509
so yeah i'm i'm trying to fold it up and
of course

756
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
of course
 

757
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,350
of course
this is like a sectional in the airplane

758
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
this is like a sectional in the airplane
 

759
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,110
this is like a sectional in the airplane
you can't fold it up to make it

760
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
you can't fold it up to make it
 

761
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,629
you can't fold it up to make it
to make it fit for a lot more money so

762
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
to make it fit for a lot more money so
 

763
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,189
to make it fit for a lot more money so
schematics is from an era where

764
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
schematics is from an era where
 

765
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,150
schematics is from an era where
the manufacturers didn't mind people

766
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
the manufacturers didn't mind people
 

767
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,910
the manufacturers didn't mind people
either sharing schematics or making

768
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
either sharing schematics or making
 

769
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,110
either sharing schematics or making
their own and

770
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
their own and
 

771
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,150
their own and
sharing them yeah and i would like to

772
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
sharing them yeah and i would like to
 

773
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,150
sharing them yeah and i would like to
i would like to figure out how to

774
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
i would like to figure out how to
 

775
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,870
i would like to figure out how to
transcribe that schematic

776
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
transcribe that schematic
 

777
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,870
transcribe that schematic
um to electronic format to include it in

778
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
um to electronic format to include it in
 

779
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,430
um to electronic format to include it in
a in a tech document

780
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
a in a tech document
 

781
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,350
a in a tech document
scan it and like a picture of it they

782
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
scan it and like a picture of it they
 

783
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,949
scan it and like a picture of it they
put a pdf oh

784
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
put a pdf oh
 

785
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,590
put a pdf oh
i could scan it but if i if i do that

786
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
i could scan it but if i if i do that
 

787
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,389
i could scan it but if i if i do that
it'll be

788
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
it'll be
 

789
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,790
it'll be
way too small i'll lose a lot of a lot

790
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
way too small i'll lose a lot of a lot
 

791
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,189
way too small i'll lose a lot of a lot
of resolutions

792
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199

 

793
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,949

i could i could do that too um i like

794
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
i could i could do that too um i like
 

795
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,790
i could i could do that too um i like
that it's all on one sheet and i haven't

796
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
that it's all on one sheet and i haven't
 

797
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,430
that it's all on one sheet and i haven't
figured out

798
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
figured out
 

799
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,949
figured out
quite how to do that yet um

800
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
quite how to do that yet um
 

801
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,310
quite how to do that yet um
i would love to be able to uh to record

802
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320
i would love to be able to uh to record
 

803
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,790
i would love to be able to uh to record
it as

804
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
it as
 

805
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,350
it as
one sheet you know one one large

806
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
one sheet you know one one large
 

807
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,389
one sheet you know one one large
schematic

808
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
schematic
 

809
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,790
schematic
and there are programs that i started

810
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
and there are programs that i started
 

811
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,949
and there are programs that i started
g-scheme is one of them but i think

812
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
g-scheme is one of them but i think
 

813
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,509
g-scheme is one of them but i think
it relied on some old packages i don't

814
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
it relied on some old packages i don't
 

815
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,670
it relied on some old packages i don't
think you can get g-steam anymore i

816
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
think you can get g-steam anymore i
 

817
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,749
think you can get g-steam anymore i
don't you wanted to record it

818
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
don't you wanted to record it
 

819
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,870
don't you wanted to record it
as one large schematic but what were you

820
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
as one large schematic but what were you
 

821
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,470
as one large schematic but what were you
gonna do with it

822
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
gonna do with it
 

823
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,550
gonna do with it
i'll eventually include it as part of

824
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
i'll eventually include it as part of
 

825
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,069
i'll eventually include it as part of
the documentation for that

826
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
the documentation for that
 

827
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,069
the documentation for that
why not just take a high-resolution

828
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
why not just take a high-resolution
 

829
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,870
why not just take a high-resolution
photograph of it

830
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
photograph of it
 

831
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,829
photograph of it
and uh i need to do it yeah i could do

832
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
and uh i need to do it yeah i could do
 

833
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,470
and uh i need to do it yeah i could do
that

834
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
that
 

835
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,670
that
i had hoped to go ahead peter

836
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
i had hoped to go ahead peter
 

837
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,269
i had hoped to go ahead peter
motor manufactured that's why i make

838
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
motor manufactured that's why i make
 

839
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,430
motor manufactured that's why i make
vessel more radios are

840
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
vessel more radios are
 

841
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,350
vessel more radios are
it could some of them are very big like

842
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
it could some of them are very big like
 

843
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,549
it could some of them are very big like
that they

844
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
that they
 

845
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,669
that they
um they do enforce and they show the top

846
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
um they do enforce and they show the top
 

847
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,949
um they do enforce and they show the top
off and then they do

848
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
off and then they do
 

849
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,069
off and then they do
the better modules well that's easy to

850
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
the better modules well that's easy to
 

851
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,069
the better modules well that's easy to
easier to do with a radio because you

852
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
easier to do with a radio because you
 

853
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,309
easier to do with a radio because you
have various sections right you've got

854
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
have various sections right you've got
 

855
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,710
have various sections right you've got
the

856
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
the
 

857
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,750
the
uh you've got all of what brought to

858
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
uh you've got all of what brought to
 

859
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,829
uh you've got all of what brought to
them

861
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,470

yeah yeah yeah can you imagine can you

862
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
yeah yeah yeah can you imagine can you
 

863
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,350
yeah yeah yeah can you imagine can you
imagine trying to

864
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
imagine trying to
 

865
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,789
imagine trying to
repair a recent

866
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
repair a recent
 

867
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,310
repair a recent
um a recent radio even a ham radio these

868
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
um a recent radio even a ham radio these
 

869
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,230
um a recent radio even a ham radio these
days i mean it's crazy

870
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
days i mean it's crazy
 

871
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,310
days i mean it's crazy
i was gonna say it's it's surface

872
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
i was gonna say it's it's surface
 

873
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,750
i was gonna say it's it's surface
mounted parts and all kinds of stuff

874
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
mounted parts and all kinds of stuff
 

875
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,230

like that

876
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
like that
 

877
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,310
like that
it's almost impossible

878
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320

 

879
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,190

and today you have a manufacturer so

880
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
and today you have a manufacturer so
 

881
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,630
and today you have a manufacturer so
apple is a

882
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
apple is a
 

883
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,870
apple is a
very good example of this but they're

884
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
very good example of this but they're
 

885
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,909
very good example of this but they're
they're not alone

886
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
they're not alone
 

887
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,630
they're not alone
but they they are the biggest um where

888
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
but they they are the biggest um where
 

889
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,870
but they they are the biggest um where
they actually uh

890
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
they actually uh
 

891
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,789
they actually uh
get out of their way they are falling

892
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
get out of their way they are falling
 

893
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,909
get out of their way they are falling
over themselves

894
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
over themselves

898
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
repairing it
 

899
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,830
repairing it
then the latest example is they did the

900
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
then the latest example is they did the
 

901
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,669
then the latest example is they did the
um

902
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
um
 

903
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,029
um
used iphone 12. um someone

904
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
used iphone 12. um someone
 

905
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,230
used iphone 12. um someone
made a 15 minute long video where he

906
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
made a 15 minute long video where he
 

907
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,789
made a 15 minute long video where he
demonstrated uh what happened if you uh

908
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
demonstrated uh what happened if you uh
 

909
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,029
demonstrated uh what happened if you uh
he he bought two identical

iphones already on a black one i think

912
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
iphones already on a black one i think
 

913
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,390
iphones already on a black one i think
and he

914
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
and he
 

915
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,430
and he
moved the uh main board from one

916
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
moved the uh main board from one
 

917
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,990
moved the uh main board from one
phone to the other and probably wouldn't

918
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
phone to the other and probably wouldn't
 

919
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,029
phone to the other and probably wouldn't
start with it

920
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
start with it
 

921
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,830
start with it
yes it started but you had to plug in

922
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
yes it started but you had to plug in
 

923
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,310
yes it started but you had to plug in
the

924
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,320
the
 

925
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,430
the
plug-in the charger in order to start it

926
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
plug-in the charger in order to start it
 

927
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,150
plug-in the charger in order to start it
and the camera didn't work and then um

928
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
and the camera didn't work and then um
 

929
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,630
and the camera didn't work and then um
a lot of things didn't work because it

930
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
a lot of things didn't work because it
 

931
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,390
a lot of things didn't work because it
it complained that it was um

932
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
it complained that it was um
 

933
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,230
it complained that it was um
uh it was uh the throat battery or

934
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
uh it was uh the throat battery or
 

935
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,470
uh it was uh the throat battery or
it was fraud something or another

936
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480

 

937
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,029

and then he moved only the cameras and

938
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
and then he moved only the cameras and
 

939
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,870
and then he moved only the cameras and
it was the same thing so um

940
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880

 

941
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,029

each little module each little module

942
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
each little module each little module
 

943
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,789
each little module each little module
has its own serial number and must be

944
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
has its own serial number and must be
 

945
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,190
has its own serial number and must be
recorded with that motherboard

946
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
recorded with that motherboard
 

947
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,510
recorded with that motherboard
so the motherboard will only work with

948
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
so the motherboard will only work with
 

949
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,789
so the motherboard will only work with
those units with

950
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
those units with
 

951
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,110
those units with
that camera with that serial number

952
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
that camera with that serial number
 

953
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,990
that camera with that serial number
um uh what they used to do in the old

954
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
um uh what they used to do in the old
 

955
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,789
um uh what they used to do in the old
days was

956
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
days was
 

957
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,590
days was
in england uk circle was work service

958
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
in england uk circle was work service

development
 

961
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,350
development
and uh i we used to mark these groups

962
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
and uh i we used to mark these groups
 

963
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,710
and uh i we used to mark these groups
with red uh

964
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
with red uh

retail stuff to stop the busy people
damn but the other one they use is like

968
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
damn but the other one they use is like
 

969
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,390
damn but the other one they use is like
a screw

970
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
a screw
 

971
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,070
a screw
it's like a stars because you need a

it's like a stars because you need a
 

973
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,470
it's like a stars because you need a
special like a special screwdriver for

other places well i was thinking that i
 

1185
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,830
other places well i was thinking that i
could set it up so that i could use it

could set it up so that i could use it
 

1187
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,950
could set it up so that i could use it
wherever i am that and pie hole if i use

1188
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
wherever i am that and pie hole if i use
 

1189
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,669
wherever i am that and pie hole if i use
a static ip address i think i can

1190
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
a static ip address i think i can
 

1191
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,549
a static ip address i think i can
um connect to that wherever i am and

1192

1305
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,750
oh okay if you want you can connect a
single board computer up to it like a

1306
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:37,760
single board computer up to it like a
 

1307
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,590
single board computer up to it like a
raspberry pi um

1308
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
raspberry pi um
 

1309
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,510
raspberry pi um
stick like octoprint on there or

1310
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
stick like octoprint on there or
 

1311
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,350
stick like octoprint on there or
something like that and then you can

1312
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
something like that and then you can
 

1313
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,110
something like that and then you can
uh then you don't have to keep swapping

1314
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,120
uh then you don't have to keep swapping
 

1315
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,470
uh then you don't have to keep swapping
sd cards in and out

1316
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
sd cards in and out
 

1317
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,750
sd cards in and out
i might do that eventually because i'd

1318
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
i might do that eventually because i'd
 

1319
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,230
i might do that eventually because i'd
like to make it so that i can remotely

1320
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
like to make it so that i can remotely
 

1321
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,870
like to make it so that i can remotely
uh print stuff and then come in to pick

1322
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
uh print stuff and then come in to pick
 

1323
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,310
uh print stuff and then come in to pick
it up kind of thing

1324
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
it up kind of thing
 

1325
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,390
it up kind of thing
but is there an advantage to that i

1326
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
but is there an advantage to that i
 

1327
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,350
but is there an advantage to that i
don't really know yet

1328
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
don't really know yet
 

1329
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,149
don't really know yet
so for now i just i just pull the sd

1330
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:00,159
so for now i just i just pull the sd
 

1331
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:15,510
so for now i just i just pull the sd
card out of the built-in computer

1332
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520

 

1333
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,990

um i'm building what's called last line

1334
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
um i'm building what's called last line
 

1335
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,830
um i'm building what's called last line
backup it's a new software product that

1336
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
backup it's a new software product that
 

1337
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,190
backup it's a new software product that
i'm developing

1338
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,200
i'm developing
 

1339
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,470
i'm developing
last line backup is just like it sounds

1340
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
last line backup is just like it sounds
 

1341
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,990
last line backup is just like it sounds
um it is the last backup in

1342
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,000
um it is the last backup in
 

1343
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,870
um it is the last backup in
a redundant backup set and it is a

1344
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
a redundant backup set and it is a
 

1345
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,990
a redundant backup set and it is a
write-only backup

1346
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
write-only backup
 

1347
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,110
write-only backup
so it's it cannot be

1348
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
so it's it cannot be
 

1349
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,470
so it's it cannot be
um affected by ransomware or any other

1350
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:38,480
um affected by ransomware or any other

kind
 

1353
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,990
kind
you mean read only backup don't you no

1354

right on it
 

1357
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,630
right on it
right only well then it can be impacted

1358
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
right only well then it can be impacted
 

1359

well it's it's a it's a bit of a
different infrastructure we don't need

1364
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
different infrastructure we don't need
 

1365
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,510
different infrastructure we don't need
to get into it at the end of the day

1366
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
to get into it at the end of the day
 

1367
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,990
to get into it at the end of the day
oh man oh man

1368
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000

 

1369
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,950

next week it has multiple layers so it's

1370
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
next week it has multiple layers so it's
 

1371

a write-only backup
 

1373
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,549
a write-only backup
and then that backup is locked once it's

1374
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
and then that backup is locked once it's
 

1375
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,389
and then that backup is locked once it's
written it cannot be rewritten over
