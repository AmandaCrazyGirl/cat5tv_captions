production studio but this is actually
 

29
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,299
production studio but this is actually
the studio for where we're going to be

30

wall and right now the idea is that is

34
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,370
wall and right now the idea is that is
 

35
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,420
wall and right now the idea is that is
where when category-five cuts off will

36
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,430
where when category-five cuts off will
 

37

to the lighting you won't even notice it

254
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:19,699
to the lighting you won't even notice it
 

255
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,519
to the lighting you won't even notice it

264
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:31,289
going to have the set designer kind of
 

265
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,779
going to have the set designer kind of

266
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:32,789
come up with some ideas on what they can
 

267
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,810
come up with some ideas on what they can
do so I don't know what what that is

268
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:35,820
do so I don't know what what that is
 

269
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,459
do so I don't know what what that is
going to be it could be like some kind

270
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:37,469
going to be it could be like some kind
 

271
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,100
going to be it could be like some kind
of fancy lighting it's also quite

272
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,110
of fancy lighting it's also quite
 

273
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,750
of fancy lighting it's also quite
off-center like it's it's far over to

274
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:44,760
off-center like it's it's far over to
 

275
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,579
off-center like it's it's far over to
the left side of the walls or I guess

276
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:46,589
the left side of the walls or I guess
 

277
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:52,579
the left side of the walls or I guess
you know yeah stage left so it may not

278
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:52,589
you know yeah stage left so it may not
 

279
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,319
you know yeah stage left so it may not
even show up on camera depending on

280
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:54,329
even show up on camera depending on
 

281
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:56,710
even show up on camera depending on
where we're standing I mean yeah drew

282
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
where we're standing I mean yeah drew
 

283
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,180
where we're standing I mean yeah drew
whenever you think about where we filmed

284
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,190
whenever you think about where we filmed
 

285
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,240
whenever you think about where we filmed
in studio D the camera was maybe only a

286
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,250
in studio D the camera was maybe only a
 

287
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,430
in studio D the camera was maybe only a
couple of inches focused above my head

288
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:04,440
couple of inches focused above my head
 

289
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,430
couple of inches focused above my head
and I mean that's that spawn it's not

290
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
and I mean that's that spawn it's not
 

291
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,610
and I mean that's that spawn it's not
seven feet so I don't think you're gonna

292
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:10,620
seven feet so I don't think you're gonna
 

293
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,670
seven feet so I don't think you're gonna
see yeah I don't think so and yeah and

294
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
see yeah I don't think so and yeah and
 

295
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,509
see yeah I don't think so and yeah and
you may not either

296
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519

 

297
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,939

yeah I think the other thing to remember

298
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:22,949
yeah I think the other thing to remember
 

299
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:24,590
yeah I think the other thing to remember
too in studio he is that we're gonna be

300
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:24,600
too in studio he is that we're gonna be
 

301
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,449
too in studio he is that we're gonna be
seated instead of standing oh it

302
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:29,459
seated instead of standing oh it
 

303
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:36,680
seated instead of standing oh it
definitely won't show yeah standing you

304
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,690
definitely won't show yeah standing you
 

305
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,449
definitely won't show yeah standing you
you only went up about six and a half

306
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:38,459
you only went up about six and a half
 

307
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,400
you only went up about six and a half
feet so it's probably would probably be

308
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,410
feet so it's probably would probably be
 

309
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,689
feet so it's probably would probably be
just that arranged we're just sitting

310
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:44,699
just that arranged we're just sitting
 

311
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:44,900

00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
of rails so our main server goes on
 

477
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,220
of rails so our main server goes on
those rails and I thought I could

478
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,230
those rails and I thought I could
 

479
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:34,439
those rails and I thought I could
strategically there's the rack has these

480
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:34,449
strategically there's the rack has these
 

481
