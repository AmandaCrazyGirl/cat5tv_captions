go by in the spring did you see me after
 

167
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,270
go by in the spring did you see me after
you moved in

168
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
you moved in
 

169
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,589
you moved in
yes so we were quarantined for the two

170
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
yes so we were quarantined for the two
 

171
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,229
yes so we were quarantined for the two
weeks

172
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
weeks
 

173
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,110
weeks
and um during that time we could see out

174
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
and um during that time we could see out
 

175
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,589
and um during that time we could see out
of the

176
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
of the
 

177
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,990
of the
living room window these massive big

178
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
living room window these massive big
 

179
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,670
living room window these massive big
icebergs

180
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
icebergs
 

181
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,190
icebergs
floating but they were big enough that

182
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
floating but they were big enough that
 

183
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,430
floating but they were big enough that
we could see them like their

184
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:32,440
we could see them like their
 

185
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,229
we could see them like their
majesticness from

186
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
majesticness from
 

187
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,550
majesticness from
as far away as we were and then when we

188
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
as far away as we were and then when we
 

189
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,630
as far away as we were and then when we
were able to get close to the ocean

190
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
were able to get close to the ocean
 

191
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,910
were able to get close to the ocean
there were hundreds of little guys

192
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
there were hundreds of little guys
 

193
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,710
there were hundreds of little guys
so it turns out they're called growlers

194
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
so it turns out they're called growlers
 

195
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,229
so it turns out they're called growlers
if they're not a certain

196
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
if they're not a certain
 

197
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,430
if they're not a certain
size right and and then they're

198
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
size right and and then they're
 

199
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,589
size right and and then they're
and then so there was tons of growlers

200
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
and then so there was tons of growlers
 

201
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,710
and then so there was tons of growlers
and then a lot of

202
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
and then a lot of
 

203
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,110
and then a lot of
icebergs as well that's almost very cool

204
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
icebergs as well that's almost very cool
 

205
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,149
icebergs as well that's almost very cool
and then

206
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
and then
 

207
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,470
and then
even the even the growlers can mess with

208
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
even the even the growlers can mess with
 

209
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,350
even the even the growlers can mess with
um with shipping right or no

210
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
um with shipping right or no
 

211
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,710
um with shipping right or no
yeah that's i think what took the

212
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
yeah that's i think what took the
 

213
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,630
yeah that's i think what took the
titanic down was a growler not

214
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
titanic down was a growler not
 

215
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,789
titanic down was a growler not
oh really oh i i thought it was a bigger

216
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
oh really oh i i thought it was a bigger
 

217
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,309
oh really oh i i thought it was a bigger
yeah because

218
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
yeah because
 

219
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,229
yeah because
i think it wasn't a bigger or if it was

220
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
i think it wasn't a bigger or if it was
 

221
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,149
i think it wasn't a bigger or if it was
a bigger it it hit below

222
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
a bigger it it hit below
 

223
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,830
a bigger it it hit below
right it was like one of those ones

224
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
right it was like one of those ones
 

225
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,750
right it was like one of those ones
where it wasn't detectable enough

226
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
where it wasn't detectable enough
 

227
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,670
where it wasn't detectable enough
for them to notice as they were powering

228
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
for them to notice as they were powering
 

229
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,990
for them to notice as they were powering
ahead

230
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000

 

231
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,350

right right right so

232
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
right right right so
 

233
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,670
right right right so
and then we there's tons of whales here

234
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
and then we there's tons of whales here
 

235
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,110
and then we there's tons of whales here

i had a script that updated my uh dns
record so that every time the ip changed
