didn't uh he's not here yet so maybe
 

23
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,950
didn't uh he's not here yet so maybe
he'll show up we'll see what happens

24
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
he'll show up we'll see what happens
 

25
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,069
he'll show up we'll see what happens
so uh let's see what all's going on

26
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
so uh let's see what all's going on
 

27
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,590
so uh let's see what all's going on
uh some something for you uh uh uh peter

28
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
uh some something for you uh uh uh peter
 

29
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,229
uh some something for you uh uh uh peter
we talked about um we talked about

30
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
we talked about um we talked about
 

31
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,069
we talked about um we talked about
docker versus virtual machines a couple

32
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
docker versus virtual machines a couple
 

33
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,590
docker versus virtual machines a couple
of weeks ago do you remember that

34
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
of weeks ago do you remember that
 

35
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,150
of weeks ago do you remember that
oh yeah yeah yeah do yeah so i ended up

36
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
oh yeah yeah yeah do yeah so i ended up
 

37
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,270
oh yeah yeah yeah do yeah so i ended up
using docker

38
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
using docker
 

39
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,549
using docker
after all that um and it's working out

40
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
after all that um and it's working out
 

41
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,590
after all that um and it's working out
really really well

42
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
really really well
 

43
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,310
really really well
i'm really pleased it's totally it's

44
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
i'm really pleased it's totally it's
 

45
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,189
i'm really pleased it's totally it's
hardly using

46
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
hardly using
 

47
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,750
hardly using
any cpu at all which is fantastic

48
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
any cpu at all which is fantastic
 

49
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,470
any cpu at all which is fantastic
the limitation with docker i run linux

50
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
the limitation with docker i run linux
 

51
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,990
the limitation with docker i run linux
here at the house

52
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
here at the house
 

53
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,350
here at the house
all over the limitation is that

54
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
all over the limitation is that
 

55
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,550
all over the limitation is that
any docker machines that i start

56
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
any docker machines that i start
 

57
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,590
any docker machines that i start
have to be linux

58
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
have to be linux
 

59
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,149
have to be linux
machines because they use the same

60
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
machines because they use the same
 

61
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,710
machines because they use the same
kernel

62
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
kernel
 

63
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,670
kernel
as the host machine they also cannot

64
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
as the host machine they also cannot
 

65
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,429
as the host machine they also cannot
write to their own file system

66
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
write to their own file system
 

67
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,190
write to their own file system
that's one of the one of the things that

68
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
that's one of the one of the things that
 

69
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,030
that's one of the one of the things that
make it so protective

70
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
make it so protective
 

71
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,310
make it so protective
but what you can do is you can set up

72
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
but what you can do is you can set up
 

73
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,390
but what you can do is you can set up
um uh uh

74
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400

 

75
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,030

shared folders or directories that you

76
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
shared folders or directories that you
 

77
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,190
shared folders or directories that you
can effectively mount like you would in

78
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
can effectively mount like you would in
 

79
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,030
can effectively mount like you would in
nfs and you can mount them to the host

80
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
nfs and you can mount them to the host
 

81
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,510
nfs and you can mount them to the host
machine and you're good to go at that

82
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
machine and you're good to go at that
 

83
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,310
machine and you're good to go at that
point

84
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
point
 

85
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,310
point
if you were to run docker on a windows

86
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
if you were to run docker on a windows
 

87
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,670
if you were to run docker on a windows
machine you could only

88
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
machine you could only
 

89
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,670
machine you could only
create windows docker

90
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
create windows docker
 

91
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,030
create windows docker
docker machines you would not be able to

92
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
docker machines you would not be able to
 

93
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,990
docker machines you would not be able to
run linux on

94
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
run linux on
 

95
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,069
run linux on
on a windows docker and you would not be

96
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
on a windows docker and you would not be
 

97
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,670
on a windows docker and you would not be
able to run windows

98
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
able to run windows
 

99
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,310
able to run windows
on a linux docker machine you know on

100
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
on a linux docker machine you know on
 

101
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,389
on a linux docker machine you know on
docker that's running on linux

102
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
docker that's running on linux
 

103
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,070
docker that's running on linux
so not even in vain in wine

104
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
so not even in vain in wine
 

105
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,150
so not even in vain in wine
wine um emulates windows as much as

106
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
wine um emulates windows as much as
 

107
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,110
wine um emulates windows as much as
possible but

108
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
possible but
 

109
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,750
possible but
it doesn't make a complete virtual

110
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
it doesn't make a complete virtual
 

111
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,470
it doesn't make a complete virtual
machine

112
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480

 

113
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,510

it just emulates those windows calls

114
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
it just emulates those windows calls
 

115
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,470
it just emulates those windows calls
and then translates them to linux

116
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
and then translates them to linux
 

117
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,350
and then translates them to linux
equivalents effectively

118
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360

 

119
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,470

it's also windows 7 as well of course

120
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
it's also windows 7 as well of course
 

121
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,790
it's also windows 7 as well of course
because it's got windows 10 calls

122
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
because it's got windows 10 calls
 

123
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,990
because it's got windows 10 calls
the and he doesn't do it 100

124
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
the and he doesn't do it 100
 

125
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,190
the and he doesn't do it 100
all the time yeah right exactly exactly

126
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
all the time yeah right exactly exactly
 

127
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,589
all the time yeah right exactly exactly
for me if i were to write a program that

128
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
for me if i were to write a program that
 

129
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,470
for me if i were to write a program that
needed to

130
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
needed to
 

131
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,509
needed to
act as a as a gui on

132
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
act as a as a gui on
 

133
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,190
act as a as a gui on
linux and on windows i would use

134
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
linux and on windows i would use
 

135
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,110
linux and on windows i would use
a um a toolkit like gtk

136
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
a um a toolkit like gtk
 

137
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,949
a um a toolkit like gtk
in my case i've had good success with

138
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
in my case i've had good success with
 

139
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,550
in my case i've had good success with
gtk2

140
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
gtk2
 

141
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,509
gtk2
and as long as you stick with the

142
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
and as long as you stick with the
 

143
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,390
and as long as you stick with the
library calls in gtk and don't make any

144
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
library calls in gtk and don't make any
 

145
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,030
library calls in gtk and don't make any
native calls directly to

146
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
native calls directly to
 

147
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,830
native calls directly to
x windows or to to the windows um

148
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
x windows or to to the windows um
 

149
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,190
x windows or to to the windows um
system it should work the key is you

150
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
system it should work the key is you
 

151
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,589
system it should work the key is you
have to compile the program

152
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
have to compile the program
 

153
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,630
have to compile the program
with the version of gtk for that

154
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
with the version of gtk for that
 

155
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,670
with the version of gtk for that
environment so for linux you have to

156
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
environment so for linux you have to
 

157
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,589
environment so for linux you have to
uh you have to build um

158
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
uh you have to build um
 

159
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,110
uh you have to build um
you have to build you have to leak your

160
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
you have to build you have to leak your
 

161
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,750
you have to build you have to leak your
program against gtk for linux to make it

162
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
program against gtk for linux to make it
 

163
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,470
program against gtk for linux to make it
run

164
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
run
 

165
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,670
run
as a linux native binary and for windows

166
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
as a linux native binary and for windows
 

167
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,470
as a linux native binary and for windows
you have to compile it under windows

168
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
you have to compile it under windows
 

169
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,390
you have to compile it under windows
against the gtk

170
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
against the gtk
 

171
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,149
against the gtk
for windows library can you do that

172
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
for windows library can you do that
 

173
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,589
for windows library can you do that
within the gtk can you say that again

174
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
within the gtk can you say that again
 

175
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,070
within the gtk can you say that again
peter

176
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
peter
 

177
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,789
peter
good day um can you do sound to type

178
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
good day um can you do sound to type
 

179
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,190
good day um can you do sound to type
things in gtk

180
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
things in gtk
 

181
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,869
things in gtk
sound yeah um probably the

182
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
sound yeah um probably the
 

183
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,350
sound yeah um probably the
only i'm not sure i have not i've not

184
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
only i'm not sure i have not i've not
 

185
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,630
only i'm not sure i have not i've not
explored sound

186
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
explored sound
 

187
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,190
explored sound
on on on gtk it's i'm sure it's possible

188
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
on on on gtk it's i'm sure it's possible
 

189
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,789
on on on gtk it's i'm sure it's possible
i'm pretty sure what you can do is is

190
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
i'm pretty sure what you can do is is
 

191
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,070
i'm pretty sure what you can do is is
say to gtk go play this

192
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
say to gtk go play this
 

193
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,149
say to gtk go play this
but i know we've mentioned this before

194
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
but i know we've mentioned this before
 

195
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,789
but i know we've mentioned this before
peter in in previous coffee breaks

196
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
peter in in previous coffee breaks
 

197
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,629
peter in in previous coffee breaks
and i think that you have to um

198
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
and i think that you have to um
 

199
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,469
and i think that you have to um
i think it depends on whether you have

200
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
i think it depends on whether you have
 

201
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,390
i think it depends on whether you have
the appropriate programs

202
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
the appropriate programs
 

203
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,990
the appropriate programs
on the box you're running on to actually

204
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
on the box you're running on to actually
 

205
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,710
on the box you're running on to actually
play the audio you might could make it

206
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
play the audio you might could make it
 

207
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,189
play the audio you might could make it
beep

208
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
beep
 

209
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,550
beep
that's probably all you can make it do

210
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
that's probably all you can make it do
 

211
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,390
that's probably all you can make it do
that's not very good but that wouldn't

212
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
that's not very good but that wouldn't
 

213
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,310
that's not very good but that wouldn't
do me more than that but anyway

214
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
do me more than that but anyway
 

215
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,510
do me more than that but anyway
well yeah i know i know but and my

216
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
well yeah i know i know but and my
 

217
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,950
well yeah i know i know but and my
answer's the same

218
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
answer's the same
 

219
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,390
answer's the same
now as um as it was then in that

220
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
now as um as it was then in that
 

221
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,510
now as um as it was then in that
i'm not sure um

222
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
i'm not sure um
 

223
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,629
i'm not sure um
what all you can do yeah i see him

224
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
what all you can do yeah i see him
 

225
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,189
what all you can do yeah i see him
i'm not sure what all you can do sober

226
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199

 

227
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,430

so peter i'm not sure what what more you

228
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
so peter i'm not sure what what more you
 

229
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,510

i know i've already talked about code

240
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
i know i've already talked about code
 

241
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,710
i know i've already talked about code
coverage

242
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
coverage
 

243
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,710
coverage
with uh with elk have i talked about

244
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
with uh with elk have i talked about
 

245
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,749
with uh with elk have i talked about
that before

246
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
that before
 

247
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,430
that before
i know we talked about test harnesses

248
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
i know we talked about test harnesses
 

249
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,950
i know we talked about test harnesses
and stuff like that so i may have

250
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
and stuff like that so i may have
 

251

program uh that is a word star clone
 

267
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,350
program uh that is a word star clone
that runs

268
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
that runs
 

269
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,550
that runs
under linux that does all the

270
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
under linux that does all the
 

271
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,469
under linux that does all the
that does all the things that words do

that would take more like that would
 

327
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,510
that would take more like that would
take more like eight hours in my ear

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,309
well actually one thing i did try to do
have you ever heard of ventoy

364
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
have you ever heard of ventoy
 

365
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,029
have you ever heard of ventoy
veentoy no t-e-n-t-o-y

366
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039

 

367
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,790

it's a program that's supposed to allow

368
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
it's a program that's supposed to allow
 

369
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,309
it's a program that's supposed to allow
you to put multiple

370
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
you to put multiple
 

371
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,270
you to put multiple
isos on a thumb drive

372
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280

 

373
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,830

uh i can do so that you could so that

374
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
uh i can do so that you could so that
 

375
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,110
uh i can do so that you could so that
you could boot from the one that you

376
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
you could boot from the one that you
 

377
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,589
you could boot from the one that you
want

378
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
want
 

379
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,550
want
but what it allows you to do is that uh

380
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
but what it allows you to do is that uh
 

381
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,230
but what it allows you to do is that uh
you're supposed to be able to just copy

382
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
you're supposed to be able to just copy
 

383
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,670
you're supposed to be able to just copy
them to the thumb drive

384
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
them to the thumb drive
 

385
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,269
them to the thumb drive
rather than burning them to an

386
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
rather than burning them to an
 

387
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,750
rather than burning them to an
individual partitioned

388
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
individual partitioned
 

389
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,350
individual partitioned
on your thumb drive so what i'm saying

390
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
on your thumb drive so what i'm saying
 

391
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,829
on your thumb drive so what i'm saying
yeah but an iso is just a it's just a

392
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
yeah but an iso is just a it's just a
 

393
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,870
yeah but an iso is just a it's just a
file although it's an

394
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
file although it's an
 

395
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,310
file although it's an
image of a cd it's in it's a cd

396
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
image of a cd it's in it's a cd
 

397
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,710
image of a cd it's in it's a cd
page so once you've burned it to an iso

398
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
page so once you've burned it to an iso
 

399
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,389
page so once you've burned it to an iso
it can be just a file but

400
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
it can be just a file but
 

401
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,269
it can be just a file but
if you just copy it to your thumb drive

402
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
if you just copy it to your thumb drive
 

403
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,190
if you just copy it to your thumb drive
it's just a file to the thumb drive it

404
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
it's just a file to the thumb drive it
 

405
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,150
it's just a file to the thumb drive it
doesn't care

406
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
doesn't care
 

407
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,829
doesn't care
you can't do much event then toy allows

408
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
you can't do much event then toy allows
 

409
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,509
you can't do much event then toy allows
you to choose the one that you want to

410
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
you to choose the one that you want to
 

411
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,630
you to choose the one that you want to
run

412
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
run
 

413
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,190
run
and i think that i haven't gotten it to

414
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
and i think that i haven't gotten it to
 

415
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,190
and i think that i haven't gotten it to
work yet but i think it

416
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
work yet but i think it
 

417
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,310
work yet but i think it
starts it up almost like an executable

418
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
starts it up almost like an executable
 

419
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,670
starts it up almost like an executable
interesting i know that in linux anyway

420
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
interesting i know that in linux anyway
 

421
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,190
interesting i know that in linux anyway
i don't know if you can do this with

422
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
i don't know if you can do this with
 

423
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,790
i don't know if you can do this with
windows

424
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
windows
 

425
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,389
windows
you can actually mount that iso image

426
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
you can actually mount that iso image
 

427
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,230
you can actually mount that iso image
as a uh as a as a drive

428
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
as a uh as a as a drive
 

429
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,630
as a uh as a as a drive
and it will and it will you can then

430
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
and it will and it will you can then
 

431
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,230
and it will and it will you can then
browse it and look at it

432
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
browse it and look at it
 

433
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,630
browse it and look at it
of course it's read only because it's a

434
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
of course it's read only because it's a
 

435
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,670
of course it's read only because it's a

a it's an
 

437
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,670
a it's an
image but you can look at it and see

438
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
image but you can look at it and see
 

439
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,949
image but you can look at it and see
what's inside it

440
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
what's inside it
 

441
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,870
what's inside it
um i do i do not believe i've seen um

442
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
um i do i do not believe i've seen um
 

443
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,550
um i do i do not believe i've seen um
i i don't believe there's any way to

444
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
i i don't believe there's any way to
 

445
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,070
i i don't believe there's any way to
manage it after that i

446
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
manage it after that i
 

447
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,990
manage it after that i
i thought and i thought it's like a

448
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
i thought and i thought it's like a
 

449
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,070
i thought and i thought it's like a
deadpool because uh

450
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
deadpool because uh
 

451
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,230
deadpool because uh
i discovered the type of zip file that

452
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
i discovered the type of zip file that
 

453
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,350
i discovered the type of zip file that
would read it and

454
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
would read it and
 

455
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,070
would read it and
uh you could own uninstalled one on one

456
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
uh you could own uninstalled one on one
 

457
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,750
uh you could own uninstalled one on one
take the bits again

458
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
take the bits again
 

459
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,430
take the bits again
and i can't think the name of it at the

460
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
and i can't think the name of it at the
 

461
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,269
and i can't think the name of it at the
moment i'm trying to think of the name

462
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
moment i'm trying to think of the name
 

463
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,269
moment i'm trying to think of the name
it's a well known one as well it's not

464
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
it's a well known one as well it's not
 

465
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,430
it's a well known one as well it's not
there but it's a well-known one

466
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
there but it's a well-known one
 

467
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,670
there but it's a well-known one
and uh yeah yeah yeah so you can

468
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
and uh yeah yeah yeah so you can
 

469
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,509
and uh yeah yeah yeah so you can
actually take the thing to beds

470
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
actually take the thing to beds
 

471
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,670
actually take the thing to beds
i did that on the desk once you have to

472
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
i did that on the desk once you have to
 

473
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,829
i did that on the desk once you have to
look at something to try oh sure

474
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
look at something to try oh sure
 

475
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,750
look at something to try oh sure
yeah that's certainly possible now

476
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
yeah that's certainly possible now
 

477
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,509
yeah that's certainly possible now
whether you can mount it and execute it

478
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
whether you can mount it and execute it
 

479
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,670
whether you can mount it and execute it
the way doug's explaining is another

480
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
the way doug's explaining is another
 

481
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,470
the way doug's explaining is another
thing

482
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
thing
 

483
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,069
thing
i mean i've only ever seen i've only

484
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
i mean i've only ever seen i've only
 

485
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,910
i mean i've only ever seen i've only
been able to execute it when i can mount

486
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
been able to execute it when i can mount
 

487
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,310
been able to execute it when i can mount
it

488
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
it
 

489
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,150
it

sd card i think i think that the um
 

811
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,189
sd card i think i think that the um
the units called rex cpm

812
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
the units called rex cpm
 

813
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,069
the units called rex cpm
i think it has a facility for backing up

814
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079

00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
i have a copy of os2 warp lying around
 

1189
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,669
i have a copy of os2 warp lying around
somewhere

1190
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
somewhere
 

1191
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,789
somewhere
that's all floppies no cds and so

1192
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
that's all floppies no cds and so
 

1193
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,510
that's all floppies no cds and so
um i've been trying to try to install it

1194
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
um i've been trying to try to install it
 

1195
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,350
um i've been trying to try to install it
on a virtual machine or something

1196
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
on a virtual machine or something
 

1197
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,669
on a virtual machine or something
anything at all but i can't get the

1198
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
anything at all but i can't get the
 

1199
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,269
anything at all but i can't get the
first disk to read through

1200
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
first disk to read through
 

1201
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,269
first disk to read through
so it won't it won't it the install

fails because the
 

1205
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,590
fails because the
the first disk uh won't read through so

1206
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
the first disk uh won't read through so
 

1207
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,149
the first disk uh won't read through so
you still have floppy drives yeah i

1208
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
you still have floppy drives yeah i
 

1209
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,669
you still have floppy drives yeah i
still have i used to have machines that

1210
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
still have i used to have machines that
 

1211
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,350
still have i used to have machines that
have floppies

1212
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
have floppies
 

1213
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,750
have floppies
yeah oh wow no i know it sounds odd but

1214
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
yeah oh wow no i know it sounds odd but

i've even got a uh um a tray system
 

1219
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,350
i've even got a uh um a tray system
where i can mount

1220
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
where i can mount
 

1221
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,750
where i can mount
um hard drive into the tray and then

1222
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
um hard drive into the tray and then
 

1223
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,350
um hard drive into the tray and then
slide it into the

1224
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
slide it into the
 

1225
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,789
slide it into the
uh into the case of the machine

1226
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
uh into the case of the machine
 

1227
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,590
uh into the case of the machine
to um so okay if i want to run if i want

1228
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,600
to um so okay if i want to run if i want
 

1229
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,830
to um so okay if i want to run if i want
to run os2 i actually label the drive

1230
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
to run os2 i actually label the drive
 

1231
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,710
to run os2 i actually label the drive
os2

1232
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
os2
 

1233
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,070
os2
or the tray os2 i slide the os2 tray in

1234
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
or the tray os2 i slide the os2 tray in
 

1235
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,789
or the tray os2 i slide the os2 tray in
there

1236
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
there
 

1237
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,029
there
turn on the machine it theoretically if

1238
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
turn on the machine it theoretically if
 

1239
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,710
turn on the machine it theoretically if
i could ever get it to start up it would

1240
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
i could ever get it to start up it would
 

1241
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,750
i could ever get it to start up it would
it would start up

1242
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
it would start up
 

1243
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,510
it would start up
that's what i do as well i do the same

1244
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
that's what i do as well i do the same

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360
it looks if you look at the back of the
 

1251
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,310
it looks if you look at the back of the
tray

1252

tray
 

1253
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,750
tray
um where it connects into the into the

1254

um where it connects into the into the
 

1255
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,870
um where it connects into the into the
frame of the um of the drop of the

1256
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
frame of the um of the drop of the
 

1257
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,110
frame of the um of the drop of the
receptacle that it fits in the old

1258
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
receptacle that it fits in the old
 

1259
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,390
receptacle that it fits in the old
centronics

1260
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
centronics
 

1261
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,750
centronics
the connectors is what it uses to um uh

1262
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:37,760
the connectors is what it uses to um uh
 

1263
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,830
the connectors is what it uses to um uh
to make a connection to the

1264
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
to make a connection to the
 

1265
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,590
to make a connection to the
uh to the actual machine between the

1266
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
uh to the actual machine between the
 

1267
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,950
uh to the actual machine between the
drive and the machine seems to work

1268
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
drive and the machine seems to work
 

1269
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,590
drive and the machine seems to work
really well

1270

so so yeah there you have it
 

1273
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,549
so so yeah there you have it
my dial swappable so i have to keep

1274
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
my dial swappable so i have to keep
 

1275
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,230
my dial swappable so i have to keep
turning the machine off if i have to do

1276
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
turning the machine off if i have to do
 

1277
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,950
turning the machine off if i have to do
that you know

1278
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
that you know
 

1279
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,789
that you know
oh sure yeah you can't you can't pull

1280
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
oh sure yeah you can't you can't pull
 

1281
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,230
oh sure yeah you can't you can't pull
the drive while the machine's running it

1282
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240
the drive while the machine's running it
 

1283
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,350
the drive while the machine's running it
would be the same as

1284
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
would be the same as
 

1285
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,630
would be the same as
it would be the same as the drive

1286
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640

it has a switch where you can switch
 

1303
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,990
it has a switch where you can switch
from 240 and 110 volts

1304
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
from 240 and 110 volts
 

1305
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,310
from 240 and 110 volts
oh i see what's coming you haven't

switched the wrong way right
 

1309
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,549
switched the wrong way right
you know here no no um

1310

there i've done it he flipped the switch
 

1315
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,190
there i've done it he flipped the switch
while the machine was running oh no i

1316

while the machine was running oh no i
 

1317
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,310
while the machine was running oh no i
have not done that

1318

have not done that
 

1319
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,029
have not done that
oh no i've had it switched the wrong way

oh no i've had it switched the wrong way
 

1321
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,389
oh no i've had it switched the wrong way
and it promptly blew up

1322
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
and it promptly blew up
 

1323
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,389
and it promptly blew up
but um yeah so these days of course

approached by but i mean what didn't
work after that

1328
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960

 

1329
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,750

i'm not surprised i have a i have a
radio board for a garage door opener

1332
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
radio board for a garage door opener
 

1333
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,870
radio board for a garage door opener
that i have to

1334
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
that i have to
 

1335
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,710
that i have to
that i have to uh replace some

1336

that i have to uh replace some
 

1337
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,430
that i have to uh replace some
components on because lightning struck

1338
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
components on because lightning struck
 

1339
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,110
components on because lightning struck
here um a long time ago now

1340
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
here um a long time ago now
 

1341
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,070
here um a long time ago now
i've just been too lazy to fix it but um

1342
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,080
i've just been too lazy to fix it but um
 

1343
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,230
i've just been too lazy to fix it but um
but lightning struck and i can see

1344
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,240
but lightning struck and i can see
 

1345
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,990
but lightning struck and i can see
the big one watt resistor that's in

1346
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
the big one watt resistor that's in
 

1347
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,389
the big one watt resistor that's in
there that just this carbon

1348
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
there that just this carbon
 

1349
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,870
there that just this carbon
you know uh carbon traces all around it

1350
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:16,880
you know uh carbon traces all around it
 

1351
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,830
you know uh carbon traces all around it
where it uh

1352
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
where it uh
 

1353
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,830
where it uh
where it blew up from the lightning

1354
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
where it blew up from the lightning
 

1355
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,870
where it blew up from the lightning
strikes so

1356
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
strikes so
 

1357
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,269
strikes so
i don't know if it's just everything

1358
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
i don't know if it's just everything
 

1359
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,789
i don't know if it's just everything
else seems to work because i can

1360
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:24,799
else seems to work because i can
 

1361
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,110
else seems to work because i can
manually close the contacts and the

1362
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
manually close the contacts and the
 

1363
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,110
manually close the contacts and the
garage door opener will work

1364
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
garage door opener will work
 

1365
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,990
garage door opener will work
but the actual radio card i think is

1366
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,000
but the actual radio card i think is
 

1367
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,590
but the actual radio card i think is
what's failed so

1368
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,600
what's failed so
 

1369
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,710
what's failed so

volts out of this thing and uh
 

1427
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,950
volts out of this thing and uh
to connect up to his amplifier but uh

1428
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
to connect up to his amplifier but uh
 

1429
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,230
to connect up to his amplifier but uh
the japanese

1430

doesn't understand that uh plugs are for
plugging in and sockets up where the hd

1434
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
plugging in and sockets up where the hd
 

1435
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,990
plugging in and sockets up where the hd
goes on they did it the other way

1436

goes on they did it the other way
 

1437

goes on they did it the other way
around so the plug on on the rig was on
