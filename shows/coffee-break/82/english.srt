a computer generated an um animation
 

115
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,910
a computer generated an um animation
right and the whole idea is that

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
right and the whole idea is that
 

117
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,630
right and the whole idea is that
before the note strikes the animation

118
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
before the note strikes the animation
 

119
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,550
before the note strikes the animation
kicks off the movement of the machine so

120
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
kicks off the movement of the machine so
 

121
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,869
kicks off the movement of the machine so
that the note strikes just as the

122
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
that the note strikes just as the
 

123
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,990
that the note strikes just as the
as the um as the striker hits the um

124
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
as the um as the striker hits the um
 

125
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,470
as the um as the striker hits the um
the key or whatever the case may be

126
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
the key or whatever the case may be
 

127
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,430
the key or whatever the case may be
right

128
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
right
 

129
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,949
right
um so this this

130
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
um so this this
 

131
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,869

00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
it goes through so much um
 

181
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,509
it goes through so much um
a design and engineering to try and make

182
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
a design and engineering to try and make
 

183
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,949
a design and engineering to try and make
the machine work

184
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
the machine work
 

185
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,429
the machine work
and it's it's it's crazy it it just

186
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
and it's it's it's crazy it it just
 

187

doesn't
 

189
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,070
doesn't
it's it's crazy anyway so

195
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,350

no this is not a model 100 i know you've

196
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
no this is not a model 100 i know you've
 

197
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,589
no this is not a model 100 i know you've
seen the model 100 before

198
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
seen the model 100 before
 

199

this is a uh let me see if i can focus

200
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
this is a uh let me see if i can focus
 

201
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:13,990
this is a uh let me see if i can focus

it it's focused primarily on writing

212
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
it it's focused primarily on writing
 

213
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,189
it it's focused primarily on writing
is what it's it's what it's there for

214
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
is what it's it's what it's there for
 

215
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,629
is what it's it's what it's there for
and that's all i ever wanted the model

216
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
and that's all i ever wanted the model
 

217
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,350
and that's all i ever wanted the model
100 for right was to take notes

218
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
100 for right was to take notes
 

219
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,110
100 for right was to take notes
the biggest problem with the model 100

220
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
the biggest problem with the model 100
 

221
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,390
the biggest problem with the model 100
was that it was

222
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
was that it was
 

223
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,870
was that it was
um it only allowed 40 characters by

224
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
um it only allowed 40 characters by
 

225
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,670
um it only allowed 40 characters by
four lines so you really couldn't see

226
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
four lines so you really couldn't see
 

227
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,629
four lines so you really couldn't see
very much

228
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
very much
 

229
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,430
very much
on the on the screen at all you couldn't

230
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
on the on the screen at all you couldn't
 

231
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,469
on the on the screen at all you couldn't
see much of the

232
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
see much of the
 

233
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,390
see much of the
of the document that you were or the

234
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
of the document that you were or the
 

235
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,150
of the document that you were or the
file that you were that you were typing

236
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
file that you were that you were typing
 

237
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,270
file that you were that you were typing
into

238
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
into
 

239
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,710
into
this does 80 characters across

240
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
this does 80 characters across
 

241
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,070
this does 80 characters across
by eight lines down so it's much more

242
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
by eight lines down so it's much more
 

243
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,270
by eight lines down so it's much more
usable screen

244
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
usable screen
 

245
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,510
usable screen
the characters obviously are a lot

246
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
the characters obviously are a lot
 

247
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,310
the characters obviously are a lot
smaller

248
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
smaller
 

249
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,830
smaller
but still easy to read so so far i'm

250
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
but still easy to read so so far i'm
 

251
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,110
but still easy to read so so far i'm
really pleased with i've only had it a

252
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
really pleased with i've only had it a
 

253
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,390
really pleased with i've only had it a
few days so

254
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
few days so
 

255
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,469
few days so
i'm still still getting used to it still

256
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
i'm still still getting used to it still
 

257
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,430
i'm still still getting used to it still
figuring it out

258
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
figuring it out
 

259
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,870
figuring it out
figuring it out but uh yeah it

260
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
figuring it out but uh yeah it
 

261
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,950
figuring it out but uh yeah it
looks like it it looks like it'll work

262
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
looks like it it looks like it'll work
 

263
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,629
looks like it it looks like it'll work
what i'm trying to find is

264
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
what i'm trying to find is
 

265
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,870
what i'm trying to find is
is something that i can carry around

266
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
is something that i can carry around
 

267
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,629
is something that i can carry around
it's still fairly large to carry around

268
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
it's still fairly large to carry around
 

269
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,629
it's still fairly large to carry around
but i think it's probably the

270
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
but i think it's probably the
 

271
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,749
but i think it's probably the
the smallest form factor that you can

272
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
the smallest form factor that you can
 

273
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,950
the smallest form factor that you can
have for the kind of

274
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
have for the kind of
 

275
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,510
have for the kind of
um for the kind of use case that i'm

276
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
um for the kind of use case that i'm
 

277
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,110
um for the kind of use case that i'm
thinking of and that is that

278
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
thinking of and that is that
 

279
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,950
thinking of and that is that
something to carry around to take notes

280
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
something to carry around to take notes
 

281
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,390
something to carry around to take notes
on

282
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
on
 

283
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,310
on
that i don't write down and then have to

284
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
that i don't write down and then have to
 

285
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,230
that i don't write down and then have to
transcribe right so i mean

286
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
transcribe right so i mean
 

287
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,830
transcribe right so i mean
i'll do it either way but it works with

288
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840

 

289
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,469

that

290
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479

 

291
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,469

see if you can that looked like a

292
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
see if you can that looked like a
 

293
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,749
see if you can that looked like a
core radio uh car radio no

294
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
core radio uh car radio no
 

295
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,070
core radio uh car radio no
it is nice it is a disk drive yep

296
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
it is nice it is a disk drive yep
 

297
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,510
it is nice it is a disk drive yep
now that is that is a a um

298
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
now that is that is a a um
 

299
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,029
now that is that is a a um
that is a cardboard keeper to uh

300
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
that is a cardboard keeper to uh
 

301
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,189
that is a cardboard keeper to uh
keep the heads protected while you're

302
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
keep the heads protected while you're
 

303
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,270
keep the heads protected while you're
around while you're traveling

304
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
around while you're traveling
 

305
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,350
around while you're traveling
they look like a comic commodore one

306
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
they look like a comic commodore one
 

307
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,909
they look like a comic commodore one
type one it's a metal design

308

type one it's a metal design
 

309
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,309
type one it's a metal design
it's probably from that it's probably

i don't know if it says when it was

316
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
i don't know if it says when it was
 

317
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,710
i don't know if it says when it was
built

318
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
built
 

319
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,350

323
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,830
be it certainly won't be the 70s
because the model 100 didn't uh didn't

324
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
because the model 100 didn't uh didn't

it work every single time so it's
 

499
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,949

know how their test harness
 

507
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,030
know how their test harness
uh survives it unless they how it passes

508
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
uh survives it unless they how it passes
 

509
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,910
uh survives it unless they how it passes
every time

510
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
every time
 

511
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,310

correct name the name of the group
 

667
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,189
correct name the name of the group
so it'd be easy just to type it out

668
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
so it'd be easy just to type it out
 

669
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,350
so it'd be easy just to type it out
it'd be easier just to put it in the in

670
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
it'd be easier just to put it in the in
 

671
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,310
it'd be easier just to put it in the in
in discord if you wouldn't mind

672
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
in discord if you wouldn't mind
 

673
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,230
in discord if you wouldn't mind

have to put up with my newbie

692
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
have to put up with my newbie
 

693
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,550
have to put up with my newbie
um my newbie pronunciation but what i'm

694
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
um my newbie pronunciation but what i'm
 

695
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,990
um my newbie pronunciation but what i'm
trying to do

696
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
trying to do
 

697
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,509
trying to do
is to make it so that

698
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
is to make it so that
 

699
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,509
is to make it so that
when a client contacts the server

700
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
when a client contacts the server
 

701
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,829
when a client contacts the server
it's encrypted over ss over

702
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
it's encrypted over ss over
 

703
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,910
it's encrypted over ss over
tls which that's that's the main

704
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
tls which that's that's the main
 

705
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,189
tls which that's that's the main
aim is to encrypt that communication but

706
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
aim is to encrypt that communication but
 

707
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,910
aim is to encrypt that communication but
i also understand that it's possible to

708
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
i also understand that it's possible to
 

709
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,590
i also understand that it's possible to
identify

710
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
identify
 

711
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,949
identify
who it is that's making the request by

712
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
who it is that's making the request by
 

713
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,069
who it is that's making the request by
um sending either an id or a key

714
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
um sending either an id or a key
 

715
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,470
um sending either an id or a key
or a private key um

716
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
or a private key um
 

717
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,670
or a private key um
and i'm looking at uh tasks task warrior

718
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
and i'm looking at uh tasks task warrior
 

719
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,710
and i'm looking at uh tasks task warrior
at the moment because i'm

720
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
at the moment because i'm
 

721
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,430
at the moment because i'm
using that you know every day and it

722
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
using that you know every day and it
 

723
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,670
using that you know every day and it
uses exactly this process

724
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
uses exactly this process
 

725
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,590
uses exactly this process
but as far as i can i'm digging in the

726
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
but as far as i can i'm digging in the
 

727
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,590
but as far as i can i'm digging in the
source code and as far as i can tell

728
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
source code and as far as i can tell
 

729
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,590
source code and as far as i can tell
although you generate a private key i

730
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
although you generate a private key i
 

731
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,269
although you generate a private key i
can't see how the server uses that

732
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
can't see how the server uses that
 

733
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:51,829
can't see how the server uses that
private

734
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
private
 

735
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,310
private
or rather the public key because the

736
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
or rather the public key because the
 

737
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,670
or rather the public key because the
client would have to have the private

738
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
client would have to have the private
 

739
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,230
client would have to have the private
key

740
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
key
 

741
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,509
key
and the server would have to have the

742
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
and the server would have to have the
 

743
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,150
and the server would have to have the
public key and theoretically

744
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
public key and theoretically
 

745
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,710
public key and theoretically
the two should allow for the

746
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
the two should allow for the
 

747
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,710
the two should allow for the
identification of the user

748
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
identification of the user
 

749
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,550
identification of the user
i'm still working through that code to

750
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
i'm still working through that code to
 

751
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,150
i'm still working through that code to
figure out how it works

752
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
figure out how it works
 

753
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,110
figure out how it works
there's also an id an actual user id or

754
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
there's also an id an actual user id or
 

755
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,910
there's also an id an actual user id or
a username

756
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
a username
 

757
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,509
a username
passed as well and it might be that that

758
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
passed as well and it might be that that
 

759
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,310
passed as well and it might be that that
or some sort of id is what's um is what

760
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
or some sort of id is what's um is what
 

761
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,150
or some sort of id is what's um is what
identifies the user

762
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
identifies the user
 

763
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,470
identifies the user
if that's true then i'm not i'm not as

764
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
if that's true then i'm not i'm not as
 

765
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,470
if that's true then i'm not i'm not as
happy that as i thought i was with

766
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
happy that as i thought i was with
 

767
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,030
happy that as i thought i was with
um being able to identify the user i'm

768
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
um being able to identify the user i'm
 

769
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,910
um being able to identify the user i'm
still looking at that

770
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
still looking at that
 

771
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,590
still looking at that
still figuring out how that fits

772
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
still figuring out how that fits
 

773
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,670
still figuring out how that fits
together so

774
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
together so
 

775
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,790
together so
i was going to ask you soul boo about um

776
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
i was going to ask you soul boo about um
 

777
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,870
i was going to ask you soul boo about um
about running your own mail server not

00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
the details of it but
 

781
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,829
the details of it but
the advantages of it because way back

782
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
the advantages of it because way back
 

783
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,470
the advantages of it because way back
when

784
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
when
 

785
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,269
when
in a few companies ago that i worked for

786
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
in a few companies ago that i worked for
 

787
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:45,590
in a few companies ago that i worked for
i

788
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
i
 

789
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,350
i
actually stood up a mail server for the

790
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
actually stood up a mail server for the
 

791
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,949
actually stood up a mail server for the
company and

792
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
company and
 

793
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,389
company and
um uh and i was surprised

794
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
um uh and i was surprised
 

795
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,670
um uh and i was surprised
shocked even at how much was exposed in

796
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
shocked even at how much was exposed in
 

797
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,870
shocked even at how much was exposed in

801
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,749
um of the of the mail server and i yeah
i can just imagine how much

802
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
i can just imagine how much
 

803
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,390
i can just imagine how much
just browsing the mail the mail server

804

the other thing i i found a new mode you

1188
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
the other thing i i found a new mode you
 

1189
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:32,710
the other thing i i found a new mode you
might be

1190
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,720
might be
 

1191
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,510
might be
everybody might be treasurer programming

1192
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520
everybody might be treasurer programming
 

1193
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,390
everybody might be treasurer programming
basically

1194
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,400
basically
 

1195
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,310
basically
um what it does is it uses a

1196
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
um what it does is it uses a
 

1197
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,789
um what it does is it uses a
uh like a uh 360 degree

1198
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
uh like a uh 360 degree
 

1199
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,549
uh like a uh 360 degree
clock and every uh 45 degrees

1200
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
clock and every uh 45 degrees
 

1201
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,630
clock and every uh 45 degrees
uh it it changes the digit and the

1202
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640
uh it it changes the digit and the
 

1203
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,269
uh it it changes the digit and the
number

1204
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
number
 

1205
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,269
number
so the number starts at zero

1206
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
so the number starts at zero
 

1207
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,230
so the number starts at zero
the next 145 degrees phase shift will be

1208
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
the next 145 degrees phase shift will be
 

1209
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,669
the next 145 degrees phase shift will be
zero zero one

1210
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
zero zero one
 

1211
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,870
zero zero one
