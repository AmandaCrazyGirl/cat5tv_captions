just log into it literally from your
 

195
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,350
just log into it literally from your
from any pc on on your network

encourages me to do that
 

219
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,350
encourages me to do that
so i'm happy to just leave it the way it

220
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
so i'm happy to just leave it the way it
 

221

turns out um i think it was canoe
 

419
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,990
turns out um i think it was canoe
turns out they did um they did something

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
turns out they did um they did something
 

421
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,550
turns out they did um they did something
else with

422
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
else with
 

423
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,670
else with
uh with with gopher and and

uh with with gopher and and
 

425
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,949
uh with with gopher and and
made some improvements to the protocol

426
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
made some improvements to the protocol
 

427
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,509
made some improvements to the protocol
yeah but those improvements don't work

428
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
yeah but those improvements don't work
 

429
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,269
yeah but those improvements don't work
with the original server

430
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
with the original server
 

431
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,750
with the original server
but if you build your code according

432
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
but if you build your code according
 

433
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,589
but if you build your code according
your page according to the original

then it works with the new server as
 

439
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,509
then it works with the new server as
well so that's what i've ended up doing

440
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
well so that's what i've ended up doing
 

441
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,509
well so that's what i've ended up doing
so do you plan to do any programming

442
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
so do you plan to do any programming
 

443
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,790
so do you plan to do any programming
with it

444
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
with it
 

445
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,630
with it
doug um i'm not much of a programmer

446
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
doug um i'm not much of a programmer
 

447
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,710
doug um i'm not much of a programmer
i've never been able to get into it

448
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
i've never been able to get into it
 

449
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,949
i've never been able to get into it
my uh my math skills are not that good

450
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
my uh my math skills are not that good
 

451
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,710
my uh my math skills are not that good
so my programming skills are not that

452
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
so my programming skills are not that
 

453
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,509
so my programming skills are not that
good

454
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
good
 

455
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,590
good
oh i don't think you need i don't think

456
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
oh i don't think you need i don't think
 

457
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,350
oh i don't think you need i don't think
you need math skills

458
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
you need math skills
 

459
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,550
you need math skills
for programming but you need a

460
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
for programming but you need a
 

461
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,070
for programming but you need a
logical thought process i think that's

462
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
logical thought process i think that's
 

463
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,670
logical thought process i think that's
that's where the math comes in math is

464
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
that's where the math comes in math is
 

465
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,110
that's where the math comes in math is
all logic

466
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
all logic
 

467
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,110
all logic
okay okay and then um i took

468
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
okay okay and then um i took
 

469
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,829
okay okay and then um i took
i went to our local community college

470
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
i went to our local community college
 

471
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,269

mathematics
told me that math and programming are a

496
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
told me that math and programming are a
 

497
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,350
told me that math and programming are a
one-to-one relationship in terms of

498
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
one-to-one relationship in terms of
 

499
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,269
one-to-one relationship in terms of
ability

500
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
ability
 

501
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,150
ability
i don't agree uh my math skills are not

502
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
i don't agree uh my math skills are not
 

503
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,310
i don't agree uh my math skills are not
strong either

504
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
strong either
 

505
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,110
strong either
one so i can't say

506
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,120
one so i can't say
 

507
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,990
one so i can't say
[Laughter]

508
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
[Laughter]
 

509
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,710
[Laughter]
i would say that a logical a logical

510
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
i would say that a logical a logical
 

511
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,509
i would say that a logical a logical
process thought process would be far

512
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
process thought process would be far
 

513
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,150
process thought process would be far
more

514
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
more
 

515
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,269
more
helpful to you than than math now i will

516
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
helpful to you than than math now i will
 

517
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,630
helpful to you than than math now i will
say

518
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
say
 

519
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,350
say
that my math did improve you know

520
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
that my math did improve you know
 

521
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,389
that my math did improve you know
plugging

522
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
plugging
 

523
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,949
plugging
numbers into equations and building

524
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
numbers into equations and building
 

525
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,550
numbers into equations and building
equations

526
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
equations
 

527
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,550
equations
um is something you do in programming

528
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
um is something you do in programming
 

529
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,790
um is something you do in programming
all the time that's all variables are

530
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
all the time that's all variables are
 

531
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,990
all the time that's all variables are
you but you build a formula

532
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
you but you build a formula
 

533
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,230
you but you build a formula
in in a program with variables and then

534
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
in in a program with variables and then
 

535
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,069
in in a program with variables and then
you plug values into the variables and

536
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
you plug values into the variables and
 

537
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,069
you plug values into the variables and
you see what comes out the other end

538
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
you see what comes out the other end
 

539
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,110
you see what comes out the other end
yeah that's programming isn't that

540
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
yeah that's programming isn't that
 

541
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,910
yeah that's programming isn't that
much that's not what he was talking

542
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
much that's not what he was talking
 

543
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,630
much that's not what he was talking
about

544
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
about
 

545
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,710
about
i got a new elementary algebra without

546
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
i got a new elementary algebra without
 

547
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,949
i got a new elementary algebra without
any problem okay i got into

548
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
any problem okay i got into
 

549
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,630
any problem okay i got into
intermediate algebra and i started

550
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
intermediate algebra and i started
 

551
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,389
intermediate algebra and i started
having issues okay

552
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
having issues okay
 

553
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,389
having issues okay
then i hit college level algebra and it

554
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
then i hit college level algebra and it
 

555
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,590
then i hit college level algebra and it
was like a brick wall

556
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
was like a brick wall
 

557
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,230
was like a brick wall
yeah yeah calculus was a brick wall for

558
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
yeah yeah calculus was a brick wall for
 

559
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,030
yeah yeah calculus was a brick wall for
me too

560
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
me too
 

561
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,509
me too
that was it for me as well i couldn't no

562
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
that was it for me as well i couldn't no
 

563
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,430
that was it for me as well i couldn't no
as far as psychology is concerned i can

564
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
as far as psychology is concerned i can
 

565
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,269
as far as psychology is concerned i can
do psychology all day long

566
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
do psychology all day long
 

567
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,470
do psychology all day long
oh god that's scary

568
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
oh god that's scary
 

569
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,910
oh god that's scary
but um math and and

570
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
but um math and and
 

571
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,750
but um math and and
programming don't work for me science i

572
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
programming don't work for me science i
 

573
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,509
programming don't work for me science i
can do okay

574
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
can do okay
 

575
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,069
can do okay
okay you know i got it i went to nursing

576
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
okay you know i got it i went to nursing
 

577
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,350
okay you know i got it i went to nursing
school and i got an a

578
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
school and i got an a
 

579
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,230
school and i got an a
in anatomy and physiology that was a

580
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
in anatomy and physiology that was a
 

581
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,430
in anatomy and physiology that was a
full semester of that

582
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440

 

583
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,949

wow wow nice

584
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
wow wow nice
 

585
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,350
wow wow nice
biology and things like that i'm good

586
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
biology and things like that i'm good
 

587
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,389
biology and things like that i'm good
with but

588
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
with but
 

589
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,629
with but
programming and math not so much

590
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639

 

591
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,990

okay so good luck with

592
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
okay so good luck with
 

593
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,230
okay so good luck with
your with your raspberry pi i i hope you

594
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
your with your raspberry pi i i hope you
 

595
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,990
your with your raspberry pi i i hope you
do get into some programming because you

596
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
do get into some programming because you
 

597
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,949
do get into some programming because you
willing

598
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
willing
 

599
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,310
willing
i do anyway but then i'm a programmer so

600
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
i do anyway but then i'm a programmer so
 

601
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,990
i do anyway but then i'm a programmer so
um it's it's good fun it's surprising

602
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
um it's it's good fun it's surprising
 

603
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,069
um it's it's good fun it's surprising
how str how good the desktop experience

604
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
how str how good the desktop experience
 

605
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,350
how str how good the desktop experience
is on a raspberry pi um

606
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
is on a raspberry pi um
 

607
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,550
is on a raspberry pi um
i the pine book pro for instance is just

608
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
i the pine book pro for instance is just
 

609
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,790
i the pine book pro for instance is just
a souped-up raspberry pi

610
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
a souped-up raspberry pi
 

611
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,230
a souped-up raspberry pi
and i forget constantly forget when i'm

612
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
and i forget constantly forget when i'm
 

613
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,110
and i forget constantly forget when i'm
playing with that

614
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
playing with that
 

615
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,269
playing with that
with that pine book pro that it's an sbc

616
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
with that pine book pro that it's an sbc
 

617
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,509
with that pine book pro that it's an sbc
it's similar to the raspberry pi it's

618
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
it's similar to the raspberry pi it's
 

619
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,389
it's similar to the raspberry pi it's
just a

620
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
just a
 

621
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,389
just a
a it's just a bit stronger that's all

622
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
a it's just a bit stronger that's all
 

623
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,110
a it's just a bit stronger that's all
you use the emmc on the prime book pro

624
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
you use the emmc on the prime book pro
 

625
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,150
you use the emmc on the prime book pro
or

626
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
or

sd card it has an emmc
 

629
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,030
sd card it has an emmc
built in but i can boot off an sd card

630
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
built in but i can boot off an sd card
 

631
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,870
built in but i can boot off an sd card
if i choose to do that

632
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
if i choose to do that
 

633
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,910
if i choose to do that
the um the uh

634
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
the um the uh
 

635
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,590
the um the uh
by default uh i will boot off the emmc

636
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
by default uh i will boot off the emmc
 

637
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,150
by default uh i will boot off the emmc
and what i did almost as soon as i got

638
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
and what i did almost as soon as i got
 

639
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,670
and what i did almost as soon as i got
it was i

640
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
it was i
 

641
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,590
it was i
uh i reprogrammed the emmc with a new

642
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
uh i reprogrammed the emmc with a new
 

643
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,710
uh i reprogrammed the emmc with a new
image with uh with a different distro a

644
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
image with uh with a different distro a
 

645
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,269
image with uh with a different distro a
different

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
different
 

647
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,269
different
linux distro on it in particular i

648
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
linux distro on it in particular i
 

649
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,150
linux distro on it in particular i
wanted to

650
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
wanted to
 

651
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,230
wanted to
use uh the desktop environment xfce

652
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
use uh the desktop environment xfce
 

653
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,949
use uh the desktop environment xfce
which i use on every other every other

654
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
which i use on every other every other
 

655
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,550
which i use on every other every other
desktop that i have

656
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
desktop that i have
 

657
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,590
desktop that i have
so

658
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600

 

659
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,430

right then let's talk about

660
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
right then let's talk about
 

661
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,509
right then let's talk about
uh i think i was saying that my

662
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
uh i think i was saying that my
 

663
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,350
uh i think i was saying that my
programming skills i feel good about my

664
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
programming skills i feel good about my
 

665
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,949
programming skills i feel good about my
programming skills but my hardware

666
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
programming skills but my hardware
 

667
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,310
programming skills but my hardware
skills not so much

668
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320

 

669
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,990

and this is my current

670
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
and this is my current
 

671
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,629
and this is my current
my current uh problem

672
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
my current uh problem
 

673
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,230
my current uh problem
this is a circuit board

674
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
this is a circuit board
 

675
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,350
this is a circuit board
out of one of my garage door openers

676
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
out of one of my garage door openers
 

677
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,470
out of one of my garage door openers
and oh yeah you can see but let me see

678
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
and oh yeah you can see but let me see
 

679
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,910
and oh yeah you can see but let me see
if i can point it out

680
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
if i can point it out
 

681
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,629
if i can point it out
here it is there

682
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639

 

683
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,550

i think you might be able to see that

684
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
i think you might be able to see that
 

685
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,990
i think you might be able to see that
the resistor

686
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
the resistor
 

687
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,710
the resistor
that's right there something burned out

688
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
that's right there something burned out
 

689
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,110
that's right there something burned out
yeah

690
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
yeah
 

691
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,110
yeah
yep you can see the scorch marks around

692
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
yep you can see the scorch marks around
 

693
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,870
yep you can see the scorch marks around
it so

694
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
it so
 

695
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,550
it so
i think i'll be doing some component

696
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
i think i'll be doing some component
 

697
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,550
i think i'll be doing some component
level repairs on this because

698
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
level repairs on this because
 

699
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,350
level repairs on this because
this board is so old that it just can't

700
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
this board is so old that it just can't
 

701
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,110
this board is so old that it just can't
you just can't find

702
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
you just can't find
 

703
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,990
you just can't find
any replacement boards this is surface

704
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
any replacement boards this is surface
 

705
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,189
any replacement boards this is surface
mounted

706
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
mounted
 

707
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,069
mounted
no no they're all they're all just read

708
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
no no they're all they're all just read
 

709
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:26,550
no no they're all they're all just read
them

710
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
them
 

711
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,629
them
i have no i'll i would have no trouble

712
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
i have no i'll i would have no trouble
 

713
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,230
i have no i'll i would have no trouble
at all ripping all of these components

714
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
at all ripping all of these components
 

715
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,790
at all ripping all of these components
out

716
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
out
 

717
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,350
out
and putting new in place but i have to

718
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
and putting new in place but i have to
 

719
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,750
and putting new in place but i have to
identify what the components are

720
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
identify what the components are
 

721
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,430
identify what the components are
here's my problem i don't know if this

722
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
here's my problem i don't know if this
 

723
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,269
here's my problem i don't know if this
will come up on the camera or not

724
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
will come up on the camera or not
 

725
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,629
will come up on the camera or not
but where my finger is over here

726
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
but where my finger is over here
 

727
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,710
but where my finger is over here
you can see some resistors right there

728
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
you can see some resistors right there
 

729
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,030
you can see some resistors right there
and they're a beige colored the body of

730
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
and they're a beige colored the body of
 

731
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,870
and they're a beige colored the body of
the resistor is beige colored

732
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
the resistor is beige colored
 

733
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,750
the resistor is beige colored
three of them yeah uh there's two of

734
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
three of them yeah uh there's two of
 

735
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,509
three of them yeah uh there's two of
them actually there's a diode above it

736
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
them actually there's a diode above it
 

737
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,710
them actually there's a diode above it
there's capacitor

738
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
there's capacitor
 

739
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,470
there's capacitor
near my finger and then and then down

740
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
near my finger and then and then down
 

741
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,350
near my finger and then and then down
here

742
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
here
 

743
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,949
here
there's what i think is a whole bunch

744
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
there's what i think is a whole bunch
 

745
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,870
there's what i think is a whole bunch
more resistors

746
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
more resistors
 

747
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,629
more resistors
but they're all green the body the body

748
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
but they're all green the body the body
 

749
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,829
but they're all green the body the body
is all green my question is

750
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
is all green my question is
 

751
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,430
is all green my question is
i've read somewhere that if they're

752
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
i've read somewhere that if they're
 

753
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,870
i've read somewhere that if they're
green like that

754
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
green like that
 

755
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,910
green like that
they're actually inductors not resistors

756
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
they're actually inductors not resistors
 

757
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,910
they're actually inductors not resistors
and i don't know if that's true or not

758
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
and i don't know if that's true or not
 

759
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,509
and i don't know if that's true or not
because i've never seen such as

760
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
because i've never seen such as
 

761
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,389
because i've never seen such as
i've never seen such a circuit that is

762
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
i've never seen such a circuit that is
 

763
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,829
i've never seen such a circuit that is
um

764
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
um
 

765
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,670
um
that has got so many inductors on it

766
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
that has got so many inductors on it
 

767
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,470
that has got so many inductors on it
uh so i'm curious it's out of a garage

768
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
uh so i'm curious it's out of a garage
 

769
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,509
uh so i'm curious it's out of a garage
door opener

770
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
door opener
 

771
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,230
door opener
these relays are switching um these

772
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
these relays are switching um these
 

773
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,430
these relays are switching um these
relays are switching

774
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
relays are switching
 

775
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,870
relays are switching
110 volts to drive the uh to drive the

776
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
110 volts to drive the uh to drive the
 

777
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,430
110 volts to drive the uh to drive the
motor

778
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
motor
 

779
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,710
motor
that runs the um that runs the

780
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
that runs the um that runs the
 

781
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,550
that runs the um that runs the
um runs the the

782
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
um runs the the
 

783
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,629
um runs the the
garage door up and down to open it and

784
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
garage door up and down to open it and
 

785
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,670
garage door up and down to open it and
close it but it's such an old garage

786
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
close it but it's such an old garage
 

787
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,550
close it but it's such an old garage
door opener it's like 20 or 30 years old

788
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
door opener it's like 20 or 30 years old
 

789
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,949
door opener it's like 20 or 30 years old
well 20 years old anyway that the um

790
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
well 20 years old anyway that the um
 

791
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,310
well 20 years old anyway that the um
that the circuit board is just not made

792
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
that the circuit board is just not made
 

793
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,430
that the circuit board is just not made
anymore

794
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
anymore
 

795
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,110
anymore
so i'm stuck with doing uh component

796
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
so i'm stuck with doing uh component
 

797
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,629
so i'm stuck with doing uh component
level repairs

798
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
level repairs
 

799
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,749
level repairs
this big old 2 watt resistor

800
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
this big old 2 watt resistor
 

801
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,910
this big old 2 watt resistor
has got scorch marks around it you can

802
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
has got scorch marks around it you can
 

803
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,949
has got scorch marks around it you can
see that

804
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
see that
 

805
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,790
see that
yeah um these two

806
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
yeah um these two
 

807
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,749
yeah um these two
resistors down here next to the relay

808
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
resistors down here next to the relay
 

809
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,470
resistors down here next to the relay
again i

810
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
again i
 

811
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,470
again i
don't know if you can see it very well

812
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
don't know if you can see it very well
 

813
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,710
don't know if you can see it very well
because the relays are getting in the

814
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
because the relays are getting in the
 

815
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,150
because the relays are getting in the
way of the light

816
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
way of the light
 

817
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,710
way of the light
but you can probably see scorch marks

818
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
but you can probably see scorch marks
 

819
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,430
but you can probably see scorch marks
around

820
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
around
 

821
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,509
around
them as well yeah are right there

822
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
them as well yeah are right there
 

823
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,949
them as well yeah are right there
and uh anyway yep so

824
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
and uh anyway yep so
 

825
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,030
and uh anyway yep so
we've got someone trying to join a fella

826
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
we've got someone trying to join a fella
 

827
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,389
we've got someone trying to join a fella
by the name of ian sutter but he's not

828
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
by the name of ian sutter but he's not
 

829
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,269
by the name of ian sutter but he's not
i've given him the okay to him to come

830
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
i've given him the okay to him to come
 

831
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,350
i've given him the okay to him to come
in but he hasn't

832
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
in but he hasn't
 

833
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,829
in but he hasn't
he's not showing up i don't know it

834
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
he's not showing up i don't know it
 

835
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,629
he's not showing up i don't know it
shows

836
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
shows
 

837
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,590
shows
it shows joining so i don't know where i

838
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
it shows joining so i don't know where i
 

839
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,749
it shows joining so i don't know where i
don't know where he is

840
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
don't know where he is
 

841
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,430
don't know where he is
maybe he'll maybe he'll show up we'll

842
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
maybe he'll maybe he'll show up we'll
 

843
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,750
maybe he'll maybe he'll show up we'll
see what happens

844
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
see what happens
 

845
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,949
see what happens
at any rate um yep so

846
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
at any rate um yep so
 

847
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,350
at any rate um yep so
peter what do you know about resistors

848
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
peter what do you know about resistors
 

849
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,350
peter what do you know about resistors
versus inductors and am i right about

850
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
versus inductors and am i right about
 

851
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,069
versus inductors and am i right about
the whole

852
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
the whole
 

853
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,189
the whole
beige colored thing versus the uh

854
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
beige colored thing versus the uh
 

855
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,189
beige colored thing versus the uh
it's very difficult but why i would do

856
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
it's very difficult but why i would do
 

857
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,870
it's very difficult but why i would do
it is to lift

858
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
it is to lift
 

859
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,909
it is to lift
uh what the the big one i would lift the

860
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
uh what the the big one i would lift the
 

861
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,870
uh what the the big one i would lift the
end up

862
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
end up
 

863
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,110
end up
and take one end off and put a

864
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
and take one end off and put a
 

865
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,870
and take one end off and put a
multimeter across there and check it

866
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
multimeter across there and check it
 

867
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,270
multimeter across there and check it
yeah

868
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
yeah
 

869
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,549
yeah
yeah yeah i would do that i would do the

870
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
yeah yeah i would do that i would do the
 

871
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,110
yeah yeah i would do that i would do the
same

872
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
same
 

873
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,950
same
that's that's going to be my next thing

874
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
that's that's going to be my next thing
 

875
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,549
that's that's going to be my next thing
the problem is of course if

876
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
the problem is of course if
 

877
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,070
the problem is of course if
if the if the board has in fact

878
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
if the if the board has in fact
 

879
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,029
if the if the board has in fact
or if the component is in fact scorched

880
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
or if the component is in fact scorched
 

881
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,990
or if the component is in fact scorched
then

882
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
then
 

883
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,070
then
it's going to be a dead short it's not

884
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
it's going to be a dead short it's not
 

885
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,990
it's going to be a dead short it's not
going to be the right resistance

886
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
going to be the right resistance
 

887
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,669
going to be the right resistance
no it'd be a rule it might be it might

888
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
no it'd be a rule it might be it might
 

889
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,029
no it'd be a rule it might be it might
be

890
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
be
 

891
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,789
be
20 more 30 percent more 40 right

892
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
20 more 30 percent more 40 right
 

893
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,510
20 more 30 percent more 40 right
because it's got caulked uh it's very

894
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
because it's got caulked uh it's very
 

895
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,150
because it's got caulked uh it's very
difficult to uh actually regret

896
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
difficult to uh actually regret
 

897
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,909
difficult to uh actually regret
uh because i look at the green ones

898
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
uh because i look at the green ones
 

899
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,110
uh because i look at the green ones
again because i wanna have a look at the

900
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
again because i wanna have a look at the
 

901
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,390
again because i wanna have a look at the
green ones again

902
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
green ones again
 

903
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,549
green ones again
i ain't got me white glasses and while

904
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
i ain't got me white glasses and while
 

905
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,230
i ain't got me white glasses and while
you're looking at those i'll say hello

906
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
you're looking at those i'll say hello
 

907

to
uh uh he shows up as ian

910
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
uh uh he shows up as ian
 

911
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,630
uh uh he shows up as ian
ian sutter on on his label hello good to

so i'm sorry i'm sorry about that
 

925
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,789
so i'm sorry i'm sorry about that
somebody somebody else i think it was

926
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
somebody somebody else i think it was
 

927
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,470
somebody somebody else i think it was
sober requested that

928
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
sober requested that
 

929
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,310
sober requested that
um that we uh changed the timing of the

930
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
um that we uh changed the timing of the
 

931
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,270
um that we uh changed the timing of the
uh

932
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
uh
 

933
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,950
uh
of the meeting and i'm open to doing

934
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
of the meeting and i'm open to doing
 

935
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,950
of the meeting and i'm open to doing
that but he never suggested any other

936
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
that but he never suggested any other
 

937
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,870
that but he never suggested any other
time slot so um

938
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
time slot so um
 

939
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,630
time slot so um
yeah that's what i thought too peter i

940
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
yeah that's what i thought too peter i
 

941
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,630
yeah that's what i thought too peter i
thought they were resistors as well

942
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
thought they were resistors as well
 

943
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,710
thought they were resistors as well
what do you do that one end up exactly

944
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
what do you do that one end up exactly
 

945
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,789
what do you do that one end up exactly
on the multimeter

946
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
on the multimeter
 

947
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,150
on the multimeter
you don't have to read the kind of goat

948
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
you don't have to read the kind of goat
 

949
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,830
you don't have to read the kind of goat
do you i do yep

950
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
do you i do yep
 

951
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:02,710
do you i do yep
sure

952
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720

 

953
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,830

i'm going to check every single

954
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
i'm going to check every single
 

955
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,669
i'm going to check every single
component both the capacitors and

956
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
component both the capacitors and
 

957
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,750
component both the capacitors and
resistors and the transients

958
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
resistors and the transients
 

959
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:20,710
resistors and the transients
yep yep yep

960
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720

 

961
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,710

what i'm worried about is those ics

962
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
what i'm worried about is those ics
 

963
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,470
what i'm worried about is those ics
because i'm concerned that

964
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
because i'm concerned that
 

965
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,710
because i'm concerned that
the ics could you tell me the black

966
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
the ics could you tell me the black
 

967
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,070
the ics could you tell me the black
troop was what the number of the

968
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
troop was what the number of the
 

969
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,350
troop was what the number of the
algorithm

970
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
algorithm
 

971
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,510
algorithm
the number on what the black eye the

972
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
the number on what the black eye the
 

973
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,710
the number on what the black eye the
black one

974
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
black one
 

975
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,950
black one
next to the ic yeah the next to the uh

976
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
next to the ic yeah the next to the uh
 

977
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,029
next to the ic yeah the next to the uh
well i can't find a i can't find a data

978
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
well i can't find a i can't find a data
 

979
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,270
well i can't find a i can't find a data
sheet on it but it is uh well in fact

980
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
sheet on it but it is uh well in fact
 

981
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,549
sheet on it but it is uh well in fact
i've got notes on it it's going to be

982
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
i've got notes on it it's going to be
 

983
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,590
i've got notes on it it's going to be
easier for me to

984
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
easier for me to
 

985
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,190
easier for me to
open it up i'll be able to

986
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200

if you set that up correctly so it was
 

1091
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,630

pins on the back with a jumper so i just

1098
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
pins on the back with a jumper so i just
 

1099
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,789
pins on the back with a jumper so i just
pulled the jumper out and put it in the

1109
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,590
of course this was after i had spent
hours trying to figure out why the

1110
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600

1119
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,870
i took the ribbon cable out of the
floppy disk inside that computer and

1120
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
floppy disk inside that computer and
 

1121
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,470
floppy disk inside that computer and
moved it to a computer i knew i could

1122
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
moved it to a computer i knew i could
 

1123
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,590
moved it to a computer i knew i could
boot from

1124
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:19,600
boot from
 

1125
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,149

and that also had a floppy disk drive in

1126
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
and that also had a floppy disk drive in
 

1127
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:22,870
and that also had a floppy disk drive in
it

1128
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880

floppy disks lying around too
so i wrote a boot floppy image to the

1134
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
so i wrote a boot floppy image to the
 

1135
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,710
so i wrote a boot floppy image to the
floppy disk

00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
yeah i figured it would be i can't find
 

1209
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,789
yeah i figured it would be i can't find
a data sheet for it or anything like

1210
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
a data sheet for it or anything like

so so i have no idea what the chip

1230
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
so so i have no idea what the chip
 

1231
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,029
so so i have no idea what the chip
does maybe you could go into uh

1232
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
does maybe you could go into uh
 

1233
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,470
does maybe you could go into uh
amazon or or youtube and get 110 volt uh

1234
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
amazon or or youtube and get 110 volt uh
 

1235
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,190
amazon or or youtube and get 110 volt uh
i assume it's all it does it's our radio

1236
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
i assume it's all it does it's our radio
 

1237
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,230
i assume it's all it does it's our radio
they cause a

1238
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
they cause a
 

1239
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,870
they cause a
a uv one there's another board there's

1240
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
a uv one there's another board there's
 

1241
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,549
a uv one there's another board there's
another board in the opener

1242
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
another board in the opener
 

1243
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,990
another board in the opener
that is the radio receiver

1244
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
that is the radio receiver
 

1245
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,149
that is the radio receiver
well no this is not the receiver this is

1246
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159
well no this is not the receiver this is
 

1247
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,990
well no this is not the receiver this is
the board that controls the opening of

1248
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
the board that controls the opening of
 

1249
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,630

and that radio receiver is what um
 

1261
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,510
and that radio receiver is what um
is what triggers this board to open the

1262
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
is what triggers this board to open the
 

1263
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,549
is what triggers this board to open the
uh

1264
