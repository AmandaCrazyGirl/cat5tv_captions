the christmas break so the two weekends
around christmas

36
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
around christmas
 

37
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,830
around christmas
that would be next weekend which i

38
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
that would be next weekend which i
 

39
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,790
that would be next weekend which i
believe is the

40
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
believe is the
 

41
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,150
believe is the
something like the 20th and then the

42
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
something like the 20th and then the
 

43
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,189
something like the 20th and then the
the weekend following which is um

44
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
the weekend following which is um

like that
just checking the calendar real quick

50
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
just checking the calendar real quick
 

51
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,149
just checking the calendar real quick
just to make sure

52
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
just to make sure
 

53
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,990
just to make sure
so yeah sunday the 20th

54
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
so yeah sunday the 20th
 

55
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,510
so yeah sunday the 20th
um is no coffee break and sunday the

56
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
um is no coffee break and sunday the
 

57
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,950
um is no coffee break and sunday the
27th

58
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
27th
 

59
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,950
27th
is no coffee break and that's because uh

60
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
is no coffee break and that's because uh
 

61
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,190
is no coffee break and that's because uh
that's because robbie has the studio

62
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
that's because robbie has the studio
 

63
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,670
that's because robbie has the studio
shut down for those two weekends

64
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
shut down for those two weekends
 

65
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,910
shut down for those two weekends
around christmas time so just bear that

66
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
around christmas time so just bear that
 

67
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,590
around christmas time so just bear that
in mind

68
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
in mind
 

69
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,149
in mind
so uh peter no need to ask if there's a

70
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
so uh peter no need to ask if there's a
 

71
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,270
so uh peter no need to ask if there's a
coffee break

72
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280

 

73
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,870

what about because there weren't then

74
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
what about because there weren't then
 

75
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,030
what about because there weren't then
what about third of january i do expect

76
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
what about third of january i do expect
 

77
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,630
what about third of january i do expect
to restart the coffee breaks on the

78
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
to restart the coffee breaks on the
 

79
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,749
to restart the coffee breaks on the
third of january

80
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
third of january
 

81
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,870
third of january
yes so that would be so you know we'll

82
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
yes so that would be so you know we'll
 

83
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,550
yes so that would be so you know we'll
all be a little bit

84
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
all be a little bit
 

85
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,389
all be a little bit
from from new year but if we're

86
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
from from new year but if we're
 

87
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,630
from from new year but if we're
if we're sober and somewhat upright then

88
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
if we're sober and somewhat upright then
 

89
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,630
if we're sober and somewhat upright then
we'll then we'll do coffee break on the

90
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
we'll then we'll do coffee break on the
 

91
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,350
we'll then we'll do coffee break on the
third

92
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
third
 

93
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,030
third
i plan to be there on the third we'll

94
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
i plan to be there on the third we'll
 

95
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,590
i plan to be there on the third we'll
see who else shows up right

96
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600

 

97
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,950

okay with that out of the way um

98
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
okay with that out of the way um
 

99
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,950
okay with that out of the way um
i have not made any progress on this

100
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
i have not made any progress on this
 

101
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,469
i have not made any progress on this
peter i'm still

102
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
peter i'm still
 

103
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,750
peter i'm still
i this is the uh do you think the

104
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
i this is the uh do you think the
 

105
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,990
i this is the uh do you think the
government i made about uh

106
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
government i made about uh
 

107
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,630
government i made about uh
i did yeah i did and i understand your

108
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
i did yeah i did and i understand your
 

109
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,550
i did yeah i did and i understand your
comments about the opto isolator and i

110
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
comments about the opto isolator and i
 

111
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,390
comments about the opto isolator and i
absolutely agree that would be

112
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
absolutely agree that would be
 

113
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,229
absolutely agree that would be
critical because the last thing you want

114
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
critical because the last thing you want
 

115
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,550
critical because the last thing you want
is any kind of voltage leaking through

116
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
is any kind of voltage leaking through
 

117
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,710
is any kind of voltage leaking through
from uh from the main side back into the

118
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
from uh from the main side back into the
 

119
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,589
from uh from the main side back into the
arduino

120
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
arduino
 

121
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,309
arduino
good and good as well yeah yeah and i

122
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
good and good as well yeah yeah and i
 

123
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,150
good and good as well yeah yeah and i
don't want that so i absolutely agree

124
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
don't want that so i absolutely agree
 

125
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,030
don't want that so i absolutely agree
with you

126
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
with you
 

127
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,550
with you
the interesting thing is this thing

128
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
the interesting thing is this thing
 

129
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,630
the interesting thing is this thing
doesn't have any opto isolators it has

130
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
doesn't have any opto isolators it has
 

131
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,949
doesn't have any opto isolators it has
the relays

132
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959

 

133
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,430

but further up go back on there because

134
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
but further up go back on there because
 

135
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,589
but further up go back on there because
i've got anything in the way hold on

136
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
i've got anything in the way hold on
 

137
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,229
i've got anything in the way hold on
um no not okay you're not going to be

138
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
um no not okay you're not going to be
 

139
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,430
um no not okay you're not going to be
able to see it very well

140
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
able to see it very well
 

141
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,710
able to see it very well
anyway but but the these are all

142
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
anyway but but the these are all
 

143
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,869
anyway but but the these are all
uh here these are all relays they're not

144
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
uh here these are all relays they're not
 

145
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,630
uh here these are all relays they're not
up to up isolators

146
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
up to up isolators
 

147
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,070
up to up isolators
and i don't know if the relays are

148
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
and i don't know if the relays are
 

149
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,229
and i don't know if the relays are
locked if the relays are locked either

150
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
locked if the relays are locked either
 

151
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:00,550
locked if the relays are locked either
what

152
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
what
 

153
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,710
what
would that do i have all that a couple

154
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
would that do i have all that a couple
 

155
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,149
would that do i have all that a couple
of down by uh

156
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
of down by uh
 

157
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,149
of down by uh
there is one down by the great relay

158
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
there is one down by the great relay
 

159
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,470
there is one down by the great relay
look on the other side the grey relay

160
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480

 

161
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,470

you're talking about this little uh i

162
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
you're talking about this little uh i
 

163
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,589
you're talking about this little uh i
see right here

164
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
see right here
 

165
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,830
see right here
yeah it was number one but you got four

166
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
yeah it was number one but you got four
 

167
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,309
yeah it was number one but you got four
legs

168
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
legs
 

169
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,309
legs
uh yeah i haven't been able to identify

170
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
uh yeah i haven't been able to identify
 

171
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,430
uh yeah i haven't been able to identify
what that chip is

172
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
what that chip is
 

173
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,670
what that chip is
actually dropping a couple of those do

174
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
actually dropping a couple of those do
 

175
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,589
actually dropping a couple of those do
you think so

176
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
you think so
 

177
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,949
you think so
i think you're fine

178
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959

 

179
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,949

oh i can't i can't see it because i'm

180
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
oh i can't i can't see it because i'm
 

181
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,350
oh i can't i can't see it because i'm
old now

182
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
old now
 

183
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,470
old now
i hate getting old i think you'll find

184
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
i hate getting old i think you'll find
 

185
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,509
i hate getting old i think you'll find
that tomorrow

186
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
that tomorrow
 

187
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,869
that tomorrow
i'll pick up that okay all right

188
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
i'll pick up that okay all right
 

189
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,949
i'll pick up that okay all right
that'd be good because it looked like

190
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
that'd be good because it looked like
 

191
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,990
that'd be good because it looked like
one anyway

192
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
one anyway
 

193
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,670
one anyway
that would make sense that would make

194
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
that would make sense that would make
 

195
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,430
that would make sense that would make
sense do you think that would uh that

196
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
sense do you think that would uh that
 

197
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,710
sense do you think that would uh that
would be between the

198
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
would be between the
 

199
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,309
would be between the
relay and the rest of the relays and the

200
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
relay and the rest of the relays and the
 

201
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,830
relay and the rest of the relays and the
rest of the circuitry then

202
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
rest of the circuitry then
 

203
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,030
rest of the circuitry then
yeah but there's only there's only two

204
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
yeah but there's only there's only two
 

205
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,990
yeah but there's only there's only two
legs uh

206
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
legs uh
 

207
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,149
legs uh
how does how does it drive three relays

208
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
how does how does it drive three relays
 

209
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,990
how does how does it drive three relays
they might be coming from the input from

210
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
they might be coming from the input from
 

211
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,070
they might be coming from the input from
somewhere else i would say to isolating

212
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
somewhere else i would say to isolating
 

213
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,149
somewhere else i would say to isolating
that ball from

214
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
that ball from
 

215
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,589
that ball from
the world um but uh

216
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
the world um but uh
 

217
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,589
the world um but uh
did he have a 12-volt power supply with

218
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
did he have a 12-volt power supply with
 

219
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,710
did he have a 12-volt power supply with
it as well

220
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
it as well
 

221
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,429
it as well
how did he drive the electronics buyer

222
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
how did he drive the electronics buyer
 

223
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,629
how did he drive the electronics buyer
as well oh no it's

224
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
as well oh no it's
 

225
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,870
as well oh no it's
it's it's mains voltage coming into this

226
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
it's it's mains voltage coming into this
 

227
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,069
it's it's mains voltage coming into this
thing

228
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
thing
 

229
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,749
thing
but some of these some of these pins

230
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
but some of these some of these pins
 

231
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,670
but some of these some of these pins
have mains voltage on them

232
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
have mains voltage on them
 

233
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,830
have mains voltage on them
yeah i know that but do you have the

234
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
yeah i know that but do you have the
 

235
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,590
yeah i know that but do you have the
electronics you don't want electronics

236
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
electronics you don't want electronics
 

237
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,550
electronics you don't want electronics
the main voltage

238
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
the main voltage
 

239
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,710
the main voltage
no absolutely not no you're absolutely

240
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
no absolutely not no you're absolutely
 

241
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,830
no absolutely not no you're absolutely
right so

242
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
right so
 

243
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,550
right so
um there has to be a there has to be

244
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
um there has to be a there has to be
 

245
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,550
um there has to be a there has to be
like a voltage regulator and i actually

246
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
like a voltage regulator and i actually
 

247
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,909
like a voltage regulator and i actually
thought that that

248
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
thought that that
 

249
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,469
thought that that
four leg um device was actually a

250
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
four leg um device was actually a
 

251
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,469
four leg um device was actually a
voltage regulator could be it could be

252
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
voltage regulator could be it could be
 

253
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,390
voltage regulator could be it could be
could be you could have one drive as

254
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
could be you could have one drive as
 

255
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,990
could be you could have one drive as
well yeah

256
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000

 

257
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,830

so i'll keep looking i'm going to try

258
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
so i'll keep looking i'm going to try
 

259
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,909
so i'll keep looking i'm going to try
and reconstruct the circuit i have no

260
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
and reconstruct the circuit i have no
 

261
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,469
and reconstruct the circuit i have no
idea

262
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
idea
 

263
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,990
idea
um how to do that from the circuit board

264
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
um how to do that from the circuit board
 

265
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,550
um how to do that from the circuit board
oh yeah by the way

266
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560

 

267
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,390

yeah do you see that

268
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
yeah do you see that
 

269
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,469
yeah do you see that
they are like magnets

270
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479

 

271
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,430

yeah okay they're natural magnets they

272
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
yeah okay they're natural magnets they
 

273
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,749
yeah okay they're natural magnets they
come

274
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
come
 

275
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,310
come
from they come from africa they come

276
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
from they come from africa they come
 

277
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,870
from they come from africa they come
from a

278
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
from a
 

279
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,590
from a
uh river bank river um

280
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
uh river bank river um
 

281
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,710
uh river bank river um
a part of a part of africa that portugal

282
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
a part of a part of africa that portugal
 

283
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,150
a part of a part of africa that portugal
run at one time

284
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
run at one time
 

285
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,150
run at one time
and it's a natural magnet and they were

286
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
and it's a natural magnet and they were
 

287
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,590
and it's a natural magnet and they were
very strong

288
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
very strong
 

289
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,749
very strong
and what are you using them for i i

290
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
and what are you using them for i i
 

291
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,950
and what are you using them for i i
bought them because i thought they were

292
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
bought them because i thought they were
 

293
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,590
bought them because i thought they were
interesting

294
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
interesting
 

295
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,510
interesting
and then and i like the shapes of them

296
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
and then and i like the shapes of them
 

297
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,189
and then and i like the shapes of them
because they're they came to exit

298
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
because they're they came to exit
 

299
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,150
because they're they came to exit
extraction okay yeah they're rather

300
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
extraction okay yeah they're rather
 

301
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,749
extraction okay yeah they're rather
annoyed

302
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
annoyed
 

303
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,270
annoyed
i thought you i thought you were using

304
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
i thought you i thought you were using
 

305
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,629
i thought you i thought you were using
them for a project and you're going to

306
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
them for a project and you're going to
 

307
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,310
them for a project and you're going to
shoot into an explanation of what the

308
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
shoot into an explanation of what the
 

309
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,590
shoot into an explanation of what the
project was but

310
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
project was but
 

311
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,950
project was but
you bought them because they were

312
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
you bought them because they were
 

313
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,310
you bought them because they were
interesting well that's a good enough

314
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
interesting well that's a good enough
 

315
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,189
interesting well that's a good enough
reason to buy them

316
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
reason to buy them
 

317
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,430
reason to buy them
andy by the john schools where the top

318
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
andy by the john schools where the top
 

319
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,189
andy by the john schools where the top
one is anyway because you know the jobs

320
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
one is anyway because you know the jobs
 

321
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,550
one is anyway because you know the jobs
cause where the rocks are

322
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
cause where the rocks are
 

323
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,350
cause where the rocks are
of that shape hexagonal shape so uh yeah

324
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
of that shape hexagonal shape so uh yeah
 

325
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,830
of that shape hexagonal shape so uh yeah
yeah

326
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
yeah
 

327
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,430
yeah
yep but they do apply

328
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
yep but they do apply
 

329
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,390
yep but they do apply
a quality of portugal which i can't

330
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
a quality of portugal which i can't
 

331
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,070
a quality of portugal which i can't
remember which one it was

332
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
remember which one it was

so i'm i'm going to first get my
 

489
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,149
so i'm i'm going to first get my
reference model working first get it

490
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
reference model working first get it
 

491
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,910
reference model working first get it
just working with whatever keys it

492
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
just working with whatever keys it
 

493
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,310
just working with whatever keys it
thinks

it needs to make it work make sure that

496
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
it needs to make it work make sure that
 

497
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,949
it needs to make it work make sure that
i understand how that works

498
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
i understand how that works
 

499
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,990
i understand how that works
and then i'm going to change it to

500
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
and then i'm going to change it to
 

501
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,110
and then i'm going to change it to
make it use a real public private key

502
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
make it use a real public private key
 

503
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,910
make it use a real public private key
so that you have to have the public key

504
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
so that you have to have the public key
 

505
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,670
so that you have to have the public key
on the server

506
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
on the server
 

507
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,590
on the server
and you have to have the private key on

508
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
and you have to have the private key on
 

509
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,110
and you have to have the private key on
the client or otherwise it won't

510
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
the client or otherwise it won't
 

511
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,550
the client or otherwise it won't
it won't connect even though it's uh

512
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
it won't connect even though it's uh
 

513
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,910
it won't connect even though it's uh
even though the the channel is encrypted

514
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
even though the the channel is encrypted
 

515
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,470
even though the the channel is encrypted
that's fine i'm okay that's what i want

516
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
that's fine i'm okay that's what i want
 

517
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,750
that's fine i'm okay that's what i want
but i also want to

518
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
but i also want to
 

519
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,350
but i also want to
unequivocally identify the

520
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
unequivocally identify the
 

521
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,670
unequivocally identify the
uh the the person who's running the

522
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
uh the the person who's running the
 

523
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,550
uh the the person who's running the
client

524
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
client
 

525
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,829
client
and i do not want to and i do not want

526
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
and i do not want to and i do not want
 

527
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,750
and i do not want to and i do not want
to rely on username and password which

528
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
to rely on username and password which
 

529
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,389
to rely on username and password which
is what i

530
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
is what i
 

531
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,110
is what i
believe the reference program is using

532
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
believe the reference program is using
 

533
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,910
believe the reference program is using
so

534
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
so
 

535
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,389
so
um i want to use a proper public private

536
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
um i want to use a proper public private
 

537
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,829
um i want to use a proper public private
key because that's how you're gonna use

538
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
key because that's how you're gonna use
 

539
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,310
key because that's how you're gonna use
pgp

540
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
pgp
 

541
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,630
pgp
uh yeah that's how you generate the keys

542
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
uh yeah that's how you generate the keys
 

543
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,310
uh yeah that's how you generate the keys
absolutely

544
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
absolutely
 

545
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,790
absolutely
right i assume there might be more than

546
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
right i assume there might be more than
 

547
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,070
right i assume there might be more than
one version out there

548
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
one version out there
 

549
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,150
one version out there
so uh well good to you

550
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
so uh well good to you
 

551
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,870
so uh well good to you
yeah gnu tls includes all the

552
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
yeah gnu tls includes all the
 

553
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,790
yeah gnu tls includes all the
functionality to generate

554
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
functionality to generate
 

555
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,509
functionality to generate
the public private key just like just

556
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
the public private key just like just
 

557
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,750
the public private key just like just
like pgp does

558
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
like pgp does
 

559
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,630
like pgp does
so i don't have to generate pgp keys but

560
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
so i don't have to generate pgp keys but
 

561
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,230
so i don't have to generate pgp keys but
i do need to generate

562
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
i do need to generate
 

563
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,150
i do need to generate
um uh i do need to generate the

564
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
um uh i do need to generate the
 

565
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,910
um uh i do need to generate the
uh uh public private keys using the gnu

566
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
uh uh public private keys using the gnu
 

567
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,030
uh uh public private keys using the gnu
tls

568
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
tls
 

569
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,829
tls
command line arguments which is the same

570
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
command line arguments which is the same
 

571
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,990
command line arguments which is the same
functionality as um

572
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
functionality as um
 

573
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,110
functionality as um
uh as uh a

574
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
uh as uh a
 

575
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,750
uh as uh a
pgp i've used i've used pgp and i use

thunderbird
 

579
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,190
thunderbird
um but i haven't found anybody who wants

to
exchange encrypted emails

584
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
exchange encrypted emails
 

585
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,389
exchange encrypted emails
if you send them encrypted emails i'll

586
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
if you send them encrypted emails i'll
 

587
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:44,630
if you send them encrypted emails i'll
say what what what is this

588
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640

 

589
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,110

what's up with that
 

599
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,310
what's up with that
i don't understand that what was that uh

600
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
i don't understand that what was that uh
 

601
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,509
i don't understand that what was that uh
thunderbirds

602
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
thunderbirds

607
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,710
60s or 70s as i recall
and it was it was marionettes it was uh

608
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
and it was it was marionettes it was uh
 

609
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,430
and it was it was marionettes it was uh
it was all

610

it was all
 

611
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,870
it was all
um puppets believe it or not but

612
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
um puppets believe it or not but
 

613
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,910
um puppets believe it or not but
um pretty realistic well yeah as

614
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
um pretty realistic well yeah as
 

615
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,710
um pretty realistic well yeah as
realistic as

616
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
realistic as
 

617
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,990
realistic as
marionettes can be so

618
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
marionettes can be so
 

619
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,670
marionettes can be so
it's an old old tv show they've done a

620
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
it's an old old tv show they've done a
 

621
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,829
it's an old old tv show they've done a
animated series since then and they've

622
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
animated series since then and they've
 

623
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,069
animated series since then and they've
done a movie since then

624
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
done a movie since then
 

625
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,110
done a movie since then
so the the concept is great

626
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
so the the concept is great
 

627
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,269
so the the concept is great
i always worry when when the people who

628
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
i always worry when when the people who
 

629
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,230
i always worry when when the people who
get in trouble

630
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
get in trouble
 

631
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,790
get in trouble
you know they they tear up a plane or a

632
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
you know they they tear up a plane or a
 

633
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,470
you know they they tear up a plane or a
plane crashes or something

634
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
plane crashes or something
 

635
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,410
plane crashes or something
and their solution

636
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:37,420
and their solution
 

637
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,590
and their solution
[Music]

638
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
[Music]
 

639
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,110
[Music]
oh yeah

640
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120

 

641
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,949

i know i was worried about that i

642
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
i know i was worried about that i
 

643
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,350
i know i was worried about that i
thought oh oh i've lost my internet but

644
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
thought oh oh i've lost my internet but
 

645
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,310
thought oh oh i've lost my internet but
no it looks okay

646
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
no it looks okay
 

647
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,269
no it looks okay
so yeah what i was saying was that the

648
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
so yeah what i was saying was that the
 

649
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,269
so yeah what i was saying was that the
the people who get in trouble with the

650
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
the people who get in trouble with the
 

651
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,949
the people who get in trouble with the
thunderbirds always seem to think that

652
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
thunderbirds always seem to think that
 

653
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,590
thunderbirds always seem to think that
the

654
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
the
 

655
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,910
the
solution when the plane goes down or

656
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
solution when the plane goes down or
 

657
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,509
solution when the plane goes down or
something like that is to

658
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
something like that is to
 

659
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,670
something like that is to
send another one and see what happens

660

we went on an island to proceed around

1146
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
we went on an island to proceed around
 

1147
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,830
we went on an island to proceed around
there so we got bloody warm by the gulf

1148
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
there so we got bloody warm by the gulf
 

1149
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,950
there so we got bloody warm by the gulf

and in england
 

1157
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,950
and in england
yeah you get a lot of wind over there

1158
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
yeah you get a lot of wind over there
 

1159
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,510
yeah you get a lot of wind over there
yeah we ever get a lot of wind

1160

yeah we ever get a lot of wind
 

1161
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,549
yeah we ever get a lot of wind
all year round no no

all year round no no
between october and about january time

1164
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
between october and about january time
 

1165
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,110
between october and about january time
for every time

1166
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
for every time
 

1167
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,149
for every time
huh okay okay 60 millimeter sounds like

1168
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
huh okay okay 60 millimeter sounds like
 

1169
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,549
huh okay okay 60 millimeter sounds like
our pacific northwest

1170
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
our pacific northwest
 

1171
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,669
our pacific northwest
yeah yeah

1172
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
yeah yeah
 

1173
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,669
yeah yeah
when the weather gets bad it gets really

1174
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
when the weather gets bad it gets really
 

1175
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,310
when the weather gets bad it gets really
quite nasty and horrible out there

1176
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
quite nasty and horrible out there
 

1177
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,990
quite nasty and horrible out there
you know i aren't really quite enough

1178
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
you know i aren't really quite enough
 

1179
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,669
you know i aren't really quite enough
then horrible weather i don't want to go

1180
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
then horrible weather i don't want to go
 

1181
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,270
then horrible weather i don't want to go
out there

1182
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,280
out there
 

1183
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,310
out there
but i think so we'll get colder weather

1184
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
but i think so we'll get colder weather
 

1185
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,590
but i think so we'll get colder weather
than we do because they're in the

1186
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
than we do because they're in the
 

1187
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,830
than we do because they're in the
landmarks you know because they're on

1188
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
landmarks you know because they're on
 

1189
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,029
landmarks you know because they're on
they're in finland yeah that's further

1190
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
they're in finland yeah that's further
 

1191
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,510
they're in finland yeah that's further
all for me i think he is signing

1192
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
all for me i think he is signing
 

1193
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,510
all for me i think he is signing
i don't quite know where he is but i got

1194
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
i don't quite know where he is but i got
 

1195
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,110
i don't quite know where he is but i got
opinions further enough for me when i

1196
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
opinions further enough for me when i
 

1197
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,870
opinions further enough for me when i
was asking where he was

1198
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
was asking where he was
 

1199
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,549
was asking where he was
would you near that land i think it's

1200
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
would you near that land i think it's
 

1201
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,549
would you near that land i think it's
further than enough for me

1202
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
further than enough for me
 

1203
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,750
further than enough for me
uh that's uh sobu yeah yeah i think we

1204
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
uh that's uh sobu yeah yeah i think we
 

1205
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,149
uh that's uh sobu yeah yeah i think we
would be

1206
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
would be
 

1207
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,950
would be
yeah and i pinned so we went discord and

1208
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
yeah and i pinned so we went discord and
 

1209
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,390
yeah and i pinned so we went discord and
told him we were ready to go

1210
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
told him we were ready to go
 

1211
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,190

1219
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,710

well we're um we're up to almost 25

1220

much else to uh
 

1241
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,149
much else to uh
to add i have not um done anything with

1242
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
to add i have not um done anything with
 

1243
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:58,710
to add i have not um done anything with
the

1244
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
the
 

1245
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,830
the
with the uh pine time it's it's still

1246
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
with the uh pine time it's it's still
 

1247
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,950
with the uh pine time it's it's still
it's still bricked i i haven't messed

1248
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
it's still bricked i i haven't messed
 

1249
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,789
it's still bricked i i haven't messed
with it at all it's still just

1250
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
with it at all it's still just
 

1251
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,350
with it at all it's still just
might be you're broken they leave it and

1252
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
might be you're broken they leave it and
 

1253
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,830
might be you're broken they leave it and
done

1254
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
done
 

1255
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,870
done
one day you gave a brain wave and

1256
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
one day you gave a brain wave and
 

1257
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,190
one day you gave a brain wave and
exactly that's exactly what i've done

1258
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
exactly that's exactly what i've done
 

1259
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,789
exactly that's exactly what i've done
and if i leave it long enough somebody

1260
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
and if i leave it long enough somebody
 

1261
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,149
and if i leave it long enough somebody
else will come up with a good

1262
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
else will come up with a good
 

1263
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,830
else will come up with a good
with a good program to load into it

1264
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
with a good program to load into it
 

1265
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,510
with a good program to load into it
which is exactly what's happened

1266
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
which is exactly what's happened
 

1267
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,430
which is exactly what's happened
so i'll probably just load their program

1268
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
so i'll probably just load their program
 

1269
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,430
so i'll probably just load their program
into it and if um

1270
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
into it and if um
 

1271
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,390
into it and if um
and if robbie ever decides to uh fire up

1272
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400
and if robbie ever decides to uh fire up
 

1273
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,310
and if robbie ever decides to uh fire up
his own pine time he says he got

1274
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
his own pine time he says he got
 

1275
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,950
his own pine time he says he got
he says he got it but um hasn't done

1276
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
he says he got it but um hasn't done
 

1277
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,070
he says he got it but um hasn't done
anything with it

1278
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
anything with it
 

1279
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,390
anything with it
well if he chooses to uh to move forward

1280
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
well if he chooses to uh to move forward
 

1281
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,149
well if he chooses to uh to move forward
with it he can just load that destroyer

1282
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
with it he can just load that destroyer
 

1283
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,750
with it he can just load that destroyer
but it's a learning curve you know you

1284
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
but it's a learning curve you know you
 

1285
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,950
but it's a learning curve you know you
learn every time we do

1286
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
learn every time we do
 

1287
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,990
learn every time we do
it is it is and and i would love to i

1288
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
it is it is and and i would love to i
 

1289
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,029
it is it is and and i would love to i
would love to

1290
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
would love to
 

1291
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,870
would love to
get in there and figure out how to

1292
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
get in there and figure out how to
 

1293
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,950
get in there and figure out how to
program the thing but the hardest part

1294
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
program the thing but the hardest part
 

1295
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,750
program the thing but the hardest part
with this

1296
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
with this
 

1297
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,230
with this
is the the physical connection that

1298
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
is the the physical connection that
 

1299
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,830
is the the physical connection that
you've got to make to these

1300
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
you've got to make to these
 

1301
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,390
you've got to make to these
right there are four tiny tiny little

1302
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
right there are four tiny tiny little
 

1303
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,510
right there are four tiny tiny little
pins in there

1304
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
pins in there
 

1305
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,510
pins in there
that you have to get just right and have

1306
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
that you have to get just right and have
 

1307
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,110
that you have to get just right and have
it there for a good

1308
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
it there for a good
 

1309
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,549
it there for a good
20 30 40 50 seconds whatever it is

1310
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
20 30 40 50 seconds whatever it is
 

1311
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,710
20 30 40 50 seconds whatever it is
in order to make sure that every single

1312
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
in order to make sure that every single
 

1313
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,789
in order to make sure that every single
bite that you send down the serial port

1314
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
bite that you send down the serial port
 

1315
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,669
bite that you send down the serial port
makes it into that unit and if you don't

1316
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
makes it into that unit and if you don't
 

1317
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,149
makes it into that unit and if you don't
have it

1318
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
have it
 

1319
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,110
have it
set up exactly right it won't program

1320
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
set up exactly right it won't program
 

1321
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,710
set up exactly right it won't program
correctly and it won't start

1322
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:18,720
correctly and it won't start
 

1323
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,430
correctly and it won't start
so it took me ages just to unlock it the

1324
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
so it took me ages just to unlock it the
 

1325
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,269
so it took me ages just to unlock it the
first thing you have to do is unlock it

1326
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
first thing you have to do is unlock it
 

1327
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,470
first thing you have to do is unlock it
they probably don't protocol as well

1328
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
they probably don't protocol as well
 

1329
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,549
they probably don't protocol as well
oh yeah there's absolutely a protocol

1330
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
oh yeah there's absolutely a protocol
 

1331
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,590
oh yeah there's absolutely a protocol
involved but

1332
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
involved but
 

1333
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,750
involved but
um there's a physical connection of four

1334
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
um there's a physical connection of four
 

1335
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,430
um there's a physical connection of four
pins that you have to

1336
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
pins that you have to
 

1337
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,549
pins that you have to
that you have to set uh pins on that you

1338
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
that you have to set uh pins on that you
 

1339
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,110
that you have to set uh pins on that you
have to set

1340
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
have to set
 

1341
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,710
have to set
um uh uh connectors on and they have to

1342
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
um uh uh connectors on and they have to
 

1343
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,149
um uh uh connectors on and they have to
have good connection for the whole

1344
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
have good connection for the whole
 

1345
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,830
have good connection for the whole
programming process or otherwise it just

1346
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:43,840
programming process or otherwise it just
 

1347
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,710
programming process or otherwise it just
won't work

1348
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
won't work
 

1349
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,350
won't work
so yeah yeah yeah you've got i go under

1350
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
so yeah yeah yeah you've got i go under
 

1351
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,669
so yeah yeah yeah you've got i go under
the electronic blockers go to the kto

1352
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
the electronic blockers go to the kto
 

1353
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,470
the electronic blockers go to the kto
plug in usb and put the thing underneath

1354
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
plug in usb and put the thing underneath
 

1355
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,990
plug in usb and put the thing underneath
you can see the thing big

1356
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
you can see the thing big
 

1357
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,750
you can see the thing big
and change it that way you know and

1358
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
and change it that way you know and
 

1359
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,430
and change it that way you know and
that's another way of doing it you know

1360
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
that's another way of doing it you know
 

1361
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,390
that's another way of doing it you know
if you're looking at

1362
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
if you're looking at
 

1363
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,870
if you're looking at
wii stuff because uh my eyes are not

1364
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
wii stuff because uh my eyes are not
 

1365
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,070
wii stuff because uh my eyes are not
good anymore though

1366
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
good anymore though
 

1367
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,669
good anymore though
you know i'm glad 200 times

1368
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
you know i'm glad 200 times
 

1369
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,789
you know i'm glad 200 times
boy i can relate to that

1370
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799

 

1371
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,549

i could so relate peter

1372
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
i could so relate peter
 

1373
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,470
i could so relate peter
i don't know what job is about no i i

1374
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
i don't know what job is about no i i
 

1375
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,870
i don't know what job is about no i i
think he's a devil wasn't tough yet to

1376
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
think he's a devil wasn't tough yet to
 

1377
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,750
think he's a devil wasn't tough yet to
play with

1378
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
play with
 

1379
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,750
play with
like i'll keep well away from it yeah

1380
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
like i'll keep well away from it yeah
 

1381
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,669
like i'll keep well away from it yeah
yeah i don't like surface mount either

1382
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
yeah i don't like surface mount either
 

1383
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,269
yeah i don't like surface mount either
i'd rather work with some

1384
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
i'd rather work with some
 

1385
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,590
i'd rather work with some
i'd rather work with this kind of stuff

1386
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
i'd rather work with this kind of stuff
 

1387
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,110
i'd rather work with this kind of stuff
and i'm i'm already

1388
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
and i'm i'm already
 

1389
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,950
and i'm i'm already
you know hardware challenged when it

1390
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
you know hardware challenged when it
 

1391
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,870
you know hardware challenged when it
comes to dealing with this stuff as well

1392
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
comes to dealing with this stuff as well
 

1393
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,149
comes to dealing with this stuff as well
so you know this is not i did

1394
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
so you know this is not i did
 

1395
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,750
so you know this is not i did
tell you um i was doing the same thing

1396
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
tell you um i was doing the same thing
 

1397
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,630
tell you um i was doing the same thing
um

1398
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
um
 

1399
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,350
um
as you know i've got three endeavors on

1400
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
as you know i've got three endeavors on
 

1401
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,390
as you know i've got three endeavors on
my mouth

1402
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
my mouth
 

1403
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,990
my mouth
and uh i've got three coaxes on my mask

1404
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
and uh i've got three coaxes on my mask
 

1405
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,590
and uh i've got three coaxes on my mask
coming down so i've got one of these

1406
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
coming down so i've got one of these
 

1407
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,510
coming down so i've got one of these
twitches as these four ways which you

1408
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
twitches as these four ways which you
 

1409
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,390
twitches as these four ways which you
think

1410
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
think
 

1411
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,789
think
and i was going to put four relays in

1412
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
and i was going to put four relays in
 

1413
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,750
and i was going to put four relays in
the box

1414
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
the box
 

1415
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,149
the box
and then i would use about the other

1416
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
and then i would use about the other
 

1417
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,310
and then i would use about the other
raspberry pi or some sort of uh

1418
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
raspberry pi or some sort of uh
 

1419
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,789
raspberry pi or some sort of uh
way i could switch it you know each one

1420
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
way i could switch it you know each one
 

1421
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,350
way i could switch it you know each one
on

1422
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
on
 

1423
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,230
on
whatever uh that's the problem i've got

1424
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
whatever uh that's the problem i've got
 

1425
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,510
whatever uh that's the problem i've got
his waterproofing

1426
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
his waterproofing
 

1427
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,750
his waterproofing
because it's so wet around here yeah i

1428
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
because it's so wet around here yeah i
 

1429
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,029
because it's so wet around here yeah i
was gonna say

1430
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
was gonna say
 

1431
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,310
was gonna say
that and you it sounds like a

1432
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
that and you it sounds like a
 

1433
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,070
that and you it sounds like a
pretty complicated project in terms of

1434
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
pretty complicated project in terms of
 

1435
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,870
pretty complicated project in terms of
you know having to to do a lot to make

1436
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
you know having to to do a lot to make
 

1437
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,269
you know having to to do a lot to make
it

1438
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:23,279
it
 

1439
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,110
it
switch these relays i might also suggest

1440
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
switch these relays i might also suggest
 

1441
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,950
switch these relays i might also suggest
for such a simple task i might also

1442
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
for such a simple task i might also
 

1443
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,549
for such a simple task i might also
suggest an arduino

1444
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
suggest an arduino
 

1445
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,510
suggest an arduino
instead of a raspberry pi because if the

1446
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
instead of a raspberry pi because if the
 

1447
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,710
instead of a raspberry pi because if the
power ever goes out

1448
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
power ever goes out
 

1449
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,070
power ever goes out
on the raspberry pi you might lose that

1450
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
on the raspberry pi you might lose that
 

1451
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,630
on the raspberry pi you might lose that
sd card and then you're done at that

1452
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
sd card and then you're done at that
 

1453
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,269
sd card and then you're done at that
point

1454
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
point
 

1455
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,470
point
okay but an arduino will just keep on

1456
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
okay but an arduino will just keep on
 

1457
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,110
okay but an arduino will just keep on
trucking

1458
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,120
trucking
 

1459
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,870
trucking
uh even if the power goes out it will

1460
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
uh even if the power goes out it will
 

1461
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,950
uh even if the power goes out it will
just crank right back up again

1462
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
just crank right back up again
 

1463
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,990
just crank right back up again
roughly the same price are they

1464
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
roughly the same price are they
 

1465
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,310
roughly the same price are they
uh yeah yeah in fact they're probably

1466
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
uh yeah yeah in fact they're probably
 

1467
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,990
uh yeah yeah in fact they're probably
cheaper i think the um

1468
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
cheaper i think the um
 

1469
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,590
cheaper i think the um
i think you can get an arduino these

1470
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
i think you can get an arduino these
 

1471
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,830
i think you can get an arduino these
days for like 20 or 30 dollars

1472
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
days for like 20 or 30 dollars
 

1473
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,510
days for like 20 or 30 dollars
i have not checked the price lately so

1474
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
i have not checked the price lately so
 

1475
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,430
i have not checked the price lately so
don't quote me um

1476

don't quote me um
 

1477
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,430
don't quote me um
but the equivalent uh raspberry you know

1478
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
but the equivalent uh raspberry you know
 

1479
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,110
but the equivalent uh raspberry you know
a raspberry pi which is a much more

1480
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
a raspberry pi which is a much more
 

1481
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,789
a raspberry pi which is a much more
powerful machine of course

1482
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
powerful machine of course
 

1483
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,110
powerful machine of course
it's more like eighty dollars to get so

1484
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
it's more like eighty dollars to get so
 

1485
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,029
it's more like eighty dollars to get so
i think once you

1486
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
i think once you
 

1487
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,549
i think once you
don't only input output on here

1488
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
don't only input output on here
 

1489
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,110
don't only input output on here
all the input outputs are there apples a

1490
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
all the input outputs are there apples a
 

1491
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,029
all the input outputs are there apples a
mechanical switch in the end

1492
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
mechanical switch in the end
 

1493
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,070
mechanical switch in the end
and uh i decided to do it easy

1494
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
and uh i decided to do it easy
 

1495
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,549
and uh i decided to do it easy
just have a mechanical forward and it's
