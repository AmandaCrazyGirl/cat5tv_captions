um above me on this side oh i got it
 

17
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,189
um above me on this side oh i got it
right for once look at that there's doug

18
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
right for once look at that there's doug
 

19
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,070
right for once look at that there's doug
on my screen so say hello doug give us a

20
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
on my screen so say hello doug give us a
 

21
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,429
on my screen so say hello doug give us a
wave thank you sir

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800

 

25
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,069

i'll have a go i'll have a go at

26
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
i'll have a go i'll have a go at
 

27
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,990
i'll have a go i'll have a go at
figuring out what it is later but anyway

28
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
figuring out what it is later but anyway
 

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,709
figuring out what it is later but anyway
this is my handy dandy you butte whiz

30
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
this is my handy dandy you butte whiz
 

31

garage door opener sequencer card
 

35
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,229
garage door opener sequencer card
and i have made some progress uh first

36
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
and i have made some progress uh first
 

37
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,110
and i have made some progress uh first
thing i did was build a component list

38
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
thing i did was build a component list
 

39
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,229
thing i did was build a component list
of all of all the components and

40
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
of all of all the components and
 

41
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,230
of all of all the components and
uh peter you were right in that

42
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
uh peter you were right in that
 

43
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,429
uh peter you were right in that
one of the components that i was that i

44
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
one of the components that i was that i
 

45
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,510
one of the components that i was that i
was looking at

46
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
was looking at
 

47
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,429
was looking at
is a um

48
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439

 

49
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,230

an opto coupler yeah that's right yeah

50
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
an opto coupler yeah that's right yeah
 

51
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,749
an opto coupler yeah that's right yeah
you you and i looked at that

52
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
you you and i looked at that
 

53
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,670
you you and i looked at that
and we we i couldn't figure out if it

54
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
and we we i couldn't figure out if it
 

55
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,910
and we we i couldn't figure out if it
was a voltage regulator or or what it

56
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
was a voltage regulator or or what it
 

57
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,070
was a voltage regulator or or what it
was and he said no it's an opto coupler

58
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
was and he said no it's an opto coupler
 

59
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,710
was and he said no it's an opto coupler
it could have been elective no no no no

60
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
it could have been elective no no no no
 

61
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,510
it could have been elective no no no no
yeah no it's

62
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
yeah no it's
 

63
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,950
yeah no it's
definitely looking at the part number

64
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
definitely looking at the part number
 

65
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,069
definitely looking at the part number
it's definitely enough though so

66
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
it's definitely enough though so
 

67
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,190
it's definitely enough though so
so um the other thing i did was

68
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
so um the other thing i did was
 

69
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,590
so um the other thing i did was
i drew a really really crappy don't

70
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
i drew a really really crappy don't
 

71
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,469
i drew a really really crappy don't
laugh

72
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
laugh
 

73
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,670
laugh
peter okay don't laugh at my crappy

74
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
peter okay don't laugh at my crappy
 

75
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,950
peter okay don't laugh at my crappy
handwriting and and

76
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
handwriting and and
 

77
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,030
handwriting and and
and and uh ugly american

78
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
and and uh ugly american
 

79
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,870
and and uh ugly american
circuit diagram yeah make my mind

80
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
circuit diagram yeah make my mind
 

81
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,870
circuit diagram yeah make my mind
this is only this is only part of the

82
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
this is only this is only part of the
 

83
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,069
this is only this is only part of the
circuit because

84
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
circuit because
 

85
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,830
circuit because
the first thing i needed to do was to

86
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
the first thing i needed to do was to
 

87
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,109
the first thing i needed to do was to
figure out

88
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
figure out
 

89
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,870
figure out
what um uh what is the

90
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
what um uh what is the
 

91
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,590
what um uh what is the
power doing on this thing and here is a

92
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
power doing on this thing and here is a
 

93
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,830
power doing on this thing and here is a
much better representation of it

94
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
much better representation of it
 

95
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,190
much better representation of it
i put this in kicad ki cad

96
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
i put this in kicad ki cad
 

97
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,390
i put this in kicad ki cad
and what i can do once i've finished the

98
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
and what i can do once i've finished the
 

99
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,589
and what i can do once i've finished the
circuit diagram

100
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
circuit diagram
 

101
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,910
circuit diagram
this is again this is only the part i

102
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
this is again this is only the part i
 

103
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,949
this is again this is only the part i
initially drew that's why

104
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
initially drew that's why
 

105
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,390
initially drew that's why
yeah i use software okay

106
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
yeah i use software okay
 

107
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,350
yeah i use software okay
yep once i finish that then i'll be able

108
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
yep once i finish that then i'll be able
 

109
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,750
yep once i finish that then i'll be able
to

110
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
to
 

111
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,190
to
um you know redraw the pcb if i want to

112
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
um you know redraw the pcb if i want to
 

113
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,630
um you know redraw the pcb if i want to
or whatever i want to do but primarily

114
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
or whatever i want to do but primarily
 

115
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,990
or whatever i want to do but primarily
i'm trying to understand what

116
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
i'm trying to understand what
 

117
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,430
i'm trying to understand what
it does so i've figured out

118
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
it does so i've figured out
 

119
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,309
it does so i've figured out
the interesting thing that really struck

120
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
the interesting thing that really struck
 

121
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,110
the interesting thing that really struck
me with these

122
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
me with these
 

123
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,350
me with these
is that only one of these relays

124
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
is that only one of these relays
 

125
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,630
is that only one of these relays
actually switches

126
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
actually switches
 

127
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,309
actually switches
the active side of the um

128
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
the active side of the um
 

129
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,670
the active side of the um
of the the power the other two relays

130
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
of the the power the other two relays
 

131
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,430
of the the power the other two relays
switch the or route more specifically

132
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
switch the or route more specifically
 

133
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,949
switch the or route more specifically
the neutral side for the

134
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
the neutral side for the
 

135
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,110
the neutral side for the
um for the uh for the motor

136
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
um for the uh for the motor
 

137
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,509
um for the uh for the motor
um the the motor that that drives the

138
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
um the the motor that that drives the
 

139
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,309
um the the motor that that drives the
garage door

140
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
garage door
 

141
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,270
garage door
up and down these two work together to

142
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
up and down these two work together to
 

143
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,149
up and down these two work together to
switch

144
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
switch
 

145
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,630
switch
effectively to polarity although don't

146
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
effectively to polarity although don't
 

147
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,309
effectively to polarity although don't
think it's a dc motor

148
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
think it's a dc motor
 

149
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,110
think it's a dc motor
i believe it's an ac motor but somehow

150
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
i believe it's an ac motor but somehow
 

151
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,949
i believe it's an ac motor but somehow
these two relays and i haven't figured

152
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
these two relays and i haven't figured
 

153
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,390
these two relays and i haven't figured
out the ins and outs of it yet

154
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
out the ins and outs of it yet
 

155
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,750
out the ins and outs of it yet
but the two relays uh uh control which

156
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
but the two relays uh uh control which
 

157
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,750
but the two relays uh uh control which
direction the two what's the voltage on

158
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
direction the two what's the voltage on
 

159
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,750
direction the two what's the voltage on
the on the mag ladder magnet yeah yeah

160
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
the on the mag ladder magnet yeah yeah
 

161
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,149
the on the mag ladder magnet yeah yeah
sure

162
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
sure
 

163
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,789
sure
yeah yeah like it would on a dc motor

164
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
yeah yeah like it would on a dc motor
 

165
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,149
yeah yeah like it would on a dc motor
but

the ugly you know the 600 pound gorilla
in the room

170
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
in the room
 

171
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,390
in the room
is this this i see this special this

172
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
is this this i see this special this
 

173
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,589
is this this i see this special this
specialized ic

174
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
specialized ic
 

175
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,990
specialized ic
that i gave you that y part number for

176
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
that i gave you that y part number for
 

177
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,110
that i gave you that y part number for
yeah yeah

178
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
yeah yeah
 

179
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,350
yeah yeah
there's no nobody knows anything about

180
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
there's no nobody knows anything about
 

181
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,869
there's no nobody knows anything about
that part i can't find any

182
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
that part i can't find any
 

183
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,030
that part i can't find any
data sheets or anything what happens is

184
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
data sheets or anything what happens is
 

185
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,030
data sheets or anything what happens is
manufactured

186
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
manufactured
 

187
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,949
manufactured
and their others don't mark them or they

188
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
and their others don't mark them or they
 

189
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,789
and their others don't mark them or they
give them funny numbers right

190
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
give them funny numbers right
 

191
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,350
give them funny numbers right
they're one-off shirts i mean by that

192
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
they're one-off shirts i mean by that
 

193
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,429
they're one-off shirts i mean by that
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

194
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

195
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,789
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
well the so you know what i do not know

196
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
well the so you know what i do not know
 

197
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,429
well the so you know what i do not know
at this point

198
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
at this point
 

199
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,390
at this point
is whether that i see is good or not so

200
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
is whether that i see is good or not so
 

201
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,429
is whether that i see is good or not so
i'm basically down to

202
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
i'm basically down to
 

203
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,670
i'm basically down to
square one again and that is component

204
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
square one again and that is component
 

205
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,509
square one again and that is component
level repairs for the

206
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
level repairs for the
 

207
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,909
level repairs for the
replacement for the components that are

208
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
replacement for the components that are
 

209
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,670
replacement for the components that are
obviously bad

210
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
obviously bad
 

211
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,110
obviously bad
uh like this big big old resistor this

212
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
uh like this big big old resistor this
 

213
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,070
uh like this big big old resistor this
big two watt resistor which you can see

214
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
big two watt resistor which you can see
 

215
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,430
big two watt resistor which you can see
right there

216
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
right there
 

217
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,230
right there
um because you can you know as we showed

218
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
um because you can you know as we showed
 

219
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,430
um because you can you know as we showed
you in previous

220
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
you in previous
 

221
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,670
you in previous
coffee breaks smoke all over it and all

222
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
coffee breaks smoke all over it and all
 

223
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,110
coffee breaks smoke all over it and all
kinds of burn marks and all kinds of

224
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
kinds of burn marks and all kinds of
 

225
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,990
kinds of burn marks and all kinds of
stuff

226
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
stuff
 

227
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,590
stuff
so there's some resistors that are

228
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
so there's some resistors that are
 

229
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,870
so there's some resistors that are
definitely going to top bread

230
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
definitely going to top bread
 

231
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,150
definitely going to top bread
yes exactly yeah so that's it

232
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
yes exactly yeah so that's it
 

233
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,870
yes exactly yeah so that's it
that's that's what i'm faced with doing

234
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
that's that's what i'm faced with doing
 

235
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,469
that's that's what i'm faced with doing
right now i'm going to have to do that

236
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
right now i'm going to have to do that
 

237
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,830
right now i'm going to have to do that
um it's going to be fun uh

238
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
um it's going to be fun uh
 

239
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,150
um it's going to be fun uh
i've got it sucks that i'm going to have

240
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
i've got it sucks that i'm going to have
 

241
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,150
i've got it sucks that i'm going to have
to get like one or two parts

242
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
to get like one or two parts
 

243
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,590
to get like one or two parts
as like a one-off robbie and jeff were

244
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
as like a one-off robbie and jeff were
 

245
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,110
as like a one-off robbie and jeff were
talking about the other day

246
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
talking about the other day
 

247
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,390
talking about the other day
using a laser printer to make pcb

248
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
using a laser printer to make pcb
 

249
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,830
using a laser printer to make pcb
there i wrote some comments in um

250
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
there i wrote some comments in um
 

251
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,430
there i wrote some comments in um
discord i don't think it's a good idea

252
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
discord i don't think it's a good idea
 

253
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,270
discord i don't think it's a good idea
because the chemicals they were using

254
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
because the chemicals they were using
 

255
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,710
because the chemicals they were using
were nasty

256
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
were nasty
 

257
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,909
were nasty
um they were using waterchloric acid and

258
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
um they were using waterchloric acid and
 

259
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,950
um they were using waterchloric acid and
uh argent peroxide which i produced in

260
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
uh argent peroxide which i produced in
 

261
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,270
uh argent peroxide which i produced in
the

262
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
the
 

263
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,950
the
exothermic reaction and it tends to go a

264
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
exothermic reaction and it tends to go a
 

265
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,150
exothermic reaction and it tends to go a
bit busy

266
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
bit busy
 

267
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,070
bit busy
and the other thing chlorine gets comes

268
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
and the other thing chlorine gets comes
 

269
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,070
and the other thing chlorine gets comes
off and he's not very nice

270
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
off and he's not very nice
 

271
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,390
off and he's not very nice
nasty so you think you're in the first

272
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
nasty so you think you're in the first

and uh they told me 50 quid for doing a
 

311
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,950
and uh they told me 50 quid for doing a
uh pcb and they wanted more money after

312
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
uh pcb and they wanted more money after
 

313

they're like
 

347
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,950
they're like
um i have i have worked with osh park

348
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
um i have i have worked with osh park
 

349
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,070
um i have i have worked with osh park
and i do

350
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
and i do
 

351
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,070
and i do
do they do one off because i'm making

352
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
do they do one off because i'm making
 

353
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,670
do they do one off because i'm making
the bulldogs the uh

354
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
the bulldogs the uh
 

355
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,110
the bulldogs the uh
um i think there's like a minimum of

356
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
um i think there's like a minimum of
 

357
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,110
um i think there's like a minimum of
three or something you'd have to get

358
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
three or something you'd have to get
 

359
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,230
three or something you'd have to get
three of them

360
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
three of them
 

361
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,710
three of them
because what they do the minimum

362
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
because what they do the minimum
 

363
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,870
because what they do the minimum
manufacturing size for the pcb

364
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
manufacturing size for the pcb
 

365
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,550
manufacturing size for the pcb
is i don't know eight by 11 or some

366
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
is i don't know eight by 11 or some
 

367
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,870
is i don't know eight by 11 or some
whatever the minimum size is

368
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
whatever the minimum size is
 

369
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,830
whatever the minimum size is
they put your part in your board in with

370
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
they put your part in your board in with
 

371
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,830
they put your part in your board in with
everybody else and try and fit it in as

372
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
everybody else and try and fit it in as
 

373
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,029
everybody else and try and fit it in as
close as possible

374
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
close as possible
 

375
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,990
close as possible
to reduce the the waste so they don't

376
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
to reduce the the waste so they don't
 

377
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,550
to reduce the the waste so they don't
waste a lot and then after the

378
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
waste a lot and then after the
 

379
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,230
waste a lot and then after the
manufacturing is done they'll

380
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
manufacturing is done they'll
 

381
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,270
manufacturing is done they'll
obviously break all the boards apart uh

382
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
obviously break all the boards apart uh
 

383
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,309
obviously break all the boards apart uh
to your individual spec board and then

384
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
to your individual spec board and then
 

385
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,950
to your individual spec board and then
send you

386
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
send you
 

387
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,150
send you
just those boards so they have to have

388
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
just those boards so they have to have
 

389
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,629
just those boards so they have to have
i don't think just one will work very

390
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
i don't think just one will work very
 

391
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,070
i don't think just one will work very
well for their manufacturing i think

392
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
well for their manufacturing i think
 

393
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,110
well for their manufacturing i think
it's got to go like

394
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
it's got to go like
 

395
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,350
it's got to go like
three or somethings a minute yeah

396
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360

 

397
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,790

yeah i i built a track we know

398
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
yeah i i built a track we know
 

399
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,830
yeah i i built a track we know
um which is an aprs arduino unit

400
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
um which is an aprs arduino unit
 

401
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,790
um which is an aprs arduino unit
it's a shield that goes on an ap on an

402
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
it's a shield that goes on an ap on an
 

403
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,830
it's a shield that goes on an ap on an

arduino
um and i think that was a nosh park i

406
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
um and i think that was a nosh park i
 

407
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,029
um and i think that was a nosh park i
had to

408
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
had to
 

409
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,070
had to
had to buy three of them um i

410
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
had to buy three of them um i
 

411
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,749
had to buy three of them um i
had to have them make three of them that

412
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
had to have them make three of them that
 

413
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,350
had to have them make three of them that
was the minimum they would number how

414
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
was the minimum they would number how
 

415
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,270
was the minimum they would number how
much how much

416
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280

 

417
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,430

honestly i don't remember but it was it

418

honestly i don't remember but it was it
 

419
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,629
honestly i don't remember but it was it
was less than

420
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
was less than
 

421
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,710
was less than
less than twenty dollars that's about

422
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
less than twenty dollars that's about
 

423
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,550
less than twenty dollars that's about
twenty including shipping

424
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
twenty including shipping
 

425
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,990
twenty including shipping
no that would be about that would be

426
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
no that would be about that would be
 

427

because a week ago um
 

549
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,990
because a week ago um
in central time zone anyway the

550
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
in central time zone anyway the
 

551
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,509
in central time zone anyway the
sun would go would go down around uh

552
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
sun would go would go down around uh
 

553
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,710
sun would go would go down around uh
you know 4 35 o'clock now it's only a

554
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
you know 4 35 o'clock now it's only a
 

555
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,150
you know 4 35 o'clock now it's only a
week after

556
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
week after
 

557
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,630
week after
is it a week yeah pretty close well two

558
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
is it a week yeah pretty close well two
 

559
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,230
is it a week yeah pretty close well two
weeks now i guess

560
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
weeks now i guess
 

561
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,910
weeks now i guess
two weeks after the shortest day of the

562
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920

656
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
no it says mini wireless keyboard mouse
 

657
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,350
no it says mini wireless keyboard mouse
combo

658
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
combo
 

659
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,350
combo
okay but you you have to know whether

660
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
okay but you you have to know whether
 

661
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,150
okay but you you have to know whether
it's bluetooth or whether it's

662
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
it's bluetooth or whether it's
 

663
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:30,790
it's bluetooth or whether it's
i'm guessing it's bluetooth

664
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800

 

665
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,550

we have to talk to robbie about that one

666
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
we have to talk to robbie about that one
 

667
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,990
we have to talk to robbie about that one
because i don't know how a wi-fi

668
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
because i don't know how a wi-fi
 

669
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,190
because i don't know how a wi-fi
keyboard well actually i have heard

670
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
keyboard well actually i have heard
 

671
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,870
keyboard well actually i have heard
i i know my roku remote controls

672
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
i i know my roku remote controls
 

673
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,310
i i know my roku remote controls
operate on 2.4 gig as well

674
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
operate on 2.4 gig as well
 

675
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,949
operate on 2.4 gig as well
on the on the wi-fi frequencies so i

676
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
on the on the wi-fi frequencies so i
 

677
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,470
on the on the wi-fi frequencies so i
guess it's nothing stopping it

678
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
guess it's nothing stopping it
 

679
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,470
guess it's nothing stopping it
from happening i would have expected it

680
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
from happening i would have expected it
 

681
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,470
from happening i would have expected it
to be bluetooth though

682
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
to be bluetooth though
 

683
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,550
to be bluetooth though
but oh well it probably the raspberry

684
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560

 

685
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,750

i wonder if it's just not showing up as

686
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
i wonder if it's just not showing up as
 

687
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,629
i wonder if it's just not showing up as
a raspberry

688
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
a raspberry
 

689
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,269
a raspberry
as a uh as a keyboard on the network or

690
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
as a uh as a keyboard on the network or
 

691
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:05,910
as a uh as a keyboard on the network or
something yeah

692
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
something yeah
 

693
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,750
something yeah
not picking it up and i'm thinking it

694
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
not picking it up and i'm thinking it
 

695
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,670
not picking it up and i'm thinking it
there somehow the raspberry pi

696
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
there somehow the raspberry pi
 

697
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,389
there somehow the raspberry pi
well yeah somehow the raspberry pi you

698
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
well yeah somehow the raspberry pi you
 

699
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,030
well yeah somehow the raspberry pi you
said

700
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
said
 

701
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,110
said
you said that keyboard unit won't work

702
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
you said that keyboard unit won't work
 

703
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,790
you said that keyboard unit won't work
on the raspberry pi but it does work on

704
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
on the raspberry pi but it does work on
 

705
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,230
on the raspberry pi but it does work on
your pc

706
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
your pc
 

707
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,750
your pc
is that true correct

708
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
is that true correct
 

709
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,790
is that true correct
that is correct so the pc

710
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
that is correct so the pc
 

711
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,069
that is correct so the pc
what's the pc running windows

712
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
what's the pc running windows
 

713
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,189
what's the pc running windows
or linux yes um

714
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
or linux yes um
 

715
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,470
or linux yes um
i might try windows 10 i might try it

716
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
i might try windows 10 i might try it
 

717
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,230
i might try windows 10 i might try it
well i'm not surprised because windows

718
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240
well i'm not surprised because windows
 

719
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,389
well i'm not surprised because windows
is loaded full of drivers for all kinds

720
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
is loaded full of drivers for all kinds

uh i might try a linux distro

726
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
uh i might try a linux distro
 

727
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,030
uh i might try a linux distro
something not raspberry pi do you have

728
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
something not raspberry pi do you have
 

729
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,389
something not raspberry pi do you have
any pcs or laptops that run linux

730

731
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,509

yes i might try that keyboard on

735
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,550

okay i might try that and see if your

736
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
okay i might try that and see if your

doug because
 

775
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,150
doug because
you're frozen but everybody else is okay

776
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
you're frozen but everybody else is okay
 

777
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,269
you're frozen but everybody else is okay
so

778
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279

so it's probably it's probably your end

782
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
so it's probably it's probably your end
 

783
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,910
so it's probably it's probably your end
at this point i mean the first thing i

784
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
at this point i mean the first thing i
 

785
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,829
at this point i mean the first thing i
checked was my internet as well but

786
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
checked was my internet as well but
 

787
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,910
checked was my internet as well but
mine's okay and everybody else in the in

788
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
mine's okay and everybody else in the in
 

789
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,430
mine's okay and everybody else in the in
the meeting is moving okay

790
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
the meeting is moving okay
 

791
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,990
the meeting is moving okay
so you were the only one who was frozen

792
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
so you were the only one who was frozen
 

793
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,110
so you were the only one who was frozen
doug yeah yeah yeah

794
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
doug yeah yeah yeah
 

795
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,629
doug yeah yeah yeah
i see you sober

796
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639

 

797
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,310

that's what i would try i would

798
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
that's what i would try i would
 

799
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,389
that's what i would try i would
definitely take that keyboard that the

800
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
definitely take that keyboard that the
 

801
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,629
definitely take that keyboard that the
raspberry pi does not recognize

802
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
raspberry pi does not recognize
 

803
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,030
raspberry pi does not recognize
and see if your linux mint laptop will

804
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
and see if your linux mint laptop will
 

805
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,550
and see if your linux mint laptop will
recognize the keyboard

806
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
recognize the keyboard
 

807
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,150
recognize the keyboard
then you'll know if it's a linux versus

808
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
then you'll know if it's a linux versus
 

809
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,150
then you'll know if it's a linux versus
windows yeah that makes sense

810
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
windows yeah that makes sense
 

811
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,509
windows yeah that makes sense
yeah well i was gonna i was gonna say

812
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
yeah well i was gonna i was gonna say
 

813
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,269
yeah well i was gonna i was gonna say
solder how are you doing but he's walked

814
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
solder how are you doing but he's walked
 

815
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:43,990
solder how are you doing but he's walked
away

816
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
away
 

817
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,829
away
he's probably off making a ham sandwich

818
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
he's probably off making a ham sandwich
 

819
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,110
he's probably off making a ham sandwich
or something

820
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
or something
 

821
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,470
or something
or some kind of a sandwich he's got all

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,230
give me um give me heartburn because i'm
having trouble

1150
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
having trouble
 

1151
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,990
having trouble
trying to figure out how to how to make

1152
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
trying to figure out how to how to make
 

1153
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,029
trying to figure out how to how to make
it work so what i'm almost tempted to do

1154
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
it work so what i'm almost tempted to do
 

1155
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,350
it work so what i'm almost tempted to do
is just keep you know start moving

1156
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
is just keep you know start moving
 

1157
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,630
is just keep you know start moving
forward with the

1158
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
forward with the
 

1159
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,430
forward with the
protocol and you know and just do it

1160
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
protocol and you know and just do it
 

1161
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,750
protocol and you know and just do it
over an unsecured connection initially

1162
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
over an unsecured connection initially
 

1163
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,710
over an unsecured connection initially
and then just plug in the ssl connection

1164
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
and then just plug in the ssl connection
 

1165
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,909
and then just plug in the ssl connection
um

1166
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:17,919
um
 

1167
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,470
um
over the top of that because it it one

1168
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
over the top of that because it it one
 

1169
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,430
over the top of that because it it one
way that looks like

1170
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
way that looks like
 

1171
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,870
way that looks like
there is there is something called um

1172
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
there is there is something called um
 

1173
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,950
there is there is something called um
um okay yeah um

1174
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
um okay yeah um
 

1175
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,549
um okay yeah um
i tested it 10 years ago for something

1176
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
i tested it 10 years ago for something
 

1177
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,830
i tested it 10 years ago for something
and it works but i didn't use it so

1178
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:37,840
and it works but i didn't use it so
 

1179
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,110
and it works but i didn't use it so
but it is possible to have a client that

1180
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
but it is possible to have a client that
 

1181
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,190
but it is possible to have a client that
is

1182
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
is
 

1183
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,950
is
not using ssl or tls or anything and

1184
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
not using ssl or tls or anything and
 

1185
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,390
not using ssl or tls or anything and
you have this um

1186
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400

 

1187
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,190

that you used to start a thing with and

1188
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
that you used to start a thing with and
 

1189
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,470
that you used to start a thing with and
it

1190
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:54,480
it
 

1191
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,909
it
tunnels the traffic over rtls

1192
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
tunnels the traffic over rtls
 

1193
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,230
tunnels the traffic over rtls
okay yeah okay or i could just use ssh

1194
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
okay yeah okay or i could just use ssh
 

1195
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,149
okay yeah okay or i could just use ssh
because i already have ssh working

1196
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
because i already have ssh working
 

1197
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,830
because i already have ssh working
between um

1198
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
between um
 

1199
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,110
between um
i only ever log into the main machine

1200
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
i only ever log into the main machine
 

1201
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,950
i only ever log into the main machine
from a laptop even on my internal

1202
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
from a laptop even on my internal
 

1203
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,870
from a laptop even on my internal
network over ssh

1204
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
network over ssh
 

1205
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,590
network over ssh
so i mean i could just use that ssh

1206
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
so i mean i could just use that ssh
 

1207
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,549
so i mean i could just use that ssh
connection

1208
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
connection
 

1209
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,390
connection
tunnel over the ssh connection if i

1210
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
tunnel over the ssh connection if i
 

1211
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,750
tunnel over the ssh connection if i
could do that so

1212
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
could do that so
 

1213
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,190
could do that so
i haven't figured out how to do that

1214
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
i haven't figured out how to do that
 

1215
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,710
i haven't figured out how to do that
either so

1216
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720

 

1217
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,669

i mean because if i do a if i do a open

1218
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
i mean because if i do a if i do a open
 

1219
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,190
i mean because if i do a if i do a open
socket and create connection

1220
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
socket and create connection
 

1221
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,710
socket and create connection
by default it's just going to make a

1222
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
by default it's just going to make a
 

1223
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,870
by default it's just going to make a
direct connection between the client

1224
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
direct connection between the client
 

1225
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,470
direct connection between the client
and the server it's not going to use a

1226
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
and the server it's not going to use a
 

1227
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,310
and the server it's not going to use a
tunnel of any kind unless i

1228
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
tunnel of any kind unless i
 

1229
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,990
tunnel of any kind unless i
tell it to so yeah

1230
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000

 

1231
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,549

um i've been working on password

1232
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
um i've been working on password
 

1233
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,070
um i've been working on password
generator

1234
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
generator
 

1235
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,909
generator
and uh yeah yeah and what i'll be doing

1236
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
and uh yeah yeah and what i'll be doing
 

1237
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:52,710
and uh yeah yeah and what i'll be doing
is

1238
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
is
 

1239
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,830
is
uh over christmas i've not been well i'm

1240
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
uh over christmas i've not been well i'm
 

1241
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,310
uh over christmas i've not been well i'm
probably

1242
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
probably
 

1243
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,789
probably
reading medical reasons but uh we won't

1244
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
reading medical reasons but uh we won't
 

1245
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,750
reading medical reasons but uh we won't
go into that

1246
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
go into that
 

1247
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,269
go into that
and uh so i decided to pick up a

1248
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
and uh so i decided to pick up a
 

1249
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,990
and uh so i decided to pick up a
computer a doctor to write this thing

1250
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
computer a doctor to write this thing
 

1251
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,110
computer a doctor to write this thing
and basically you create a 64-bit patch

1252
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
and basically you create a 64-bit patch
 

1253
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,990
and basically you create a 64-bit patch
code

1254
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
code
 

1255
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,350
code
and and use that to create the

1256
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:13,360
and and use that to create the
 

1257
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,710
and and use that to create the
uh the user pass phrase you know like a

1258
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
uh the user pass phrase you know like a
 

1259
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,830
uh the user pass phrase you know like a
bb-9

1260
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:17,840
bb-9
 

1261
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,909
bb-9
and they created the x-codes then from

1262
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
and they created the x-codes then from
 

1263
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,990
and they created the x-codes then from
their code you create the uh

1264
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
their code you create the uh
 

1265
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,830
their code you create the uh
the text from that uh

1266
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
the text from that uh
 

1267
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,190
the text from that uh
you can change it from um uh

1268
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
you can change it from um uh
 

1269
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,029
you can change it from um uh
uppercase lowercase letters numbers

1270
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
uppercase lowercase letters numbers
 

1271
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,710
uppercase lowercase letters numbers
mixture of letters um and uh both cases

1272
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:36,720
mixture of letters um and uh both cases
 

1273
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,070
mixture of letters um and uh both cases
i integrate 76 uh

1274
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
i integrate 76 uh
 

1275
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,549
i integrate 76 uh
um between 50 and 76 characters

1276
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
um between 50 and 76 characters

never occurred to me to build a password

never occurred to me to build a password
 

1287
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,830
never occurred to me to build a password
generator because

1288

um it generates passwords for me

1296
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
um it generates passwords for me
 

1297
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,669
um it generates passwords for me
so it never occurred to me to to

1298
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
so it never occurred to me to to
 

1299
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,669
so it never occurred to me to to
write a program to generate passwords

1300
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
write a program to generate passwords
 

1301
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,350
write a program to generate passwords
but it works well that would work very

1302
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360
but it works well that would work very
 

1303
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,390
but it works well that would work very
well though

1304
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
well though
 

1305
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,870
well though
it does work out good i think i would

1306
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
it does work out good i think i would
 

1307
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,669
it does work out good i think i would
talk to

1308
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:19,679
talk to
 

1309
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,750
talk to
my and these are the mathematicians of

1310
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
my and these are the mathematicians of

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,269
my and these are the mathematicians of
my younger brother

1312
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
my younger brother
 

1313
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,430
my younger brother
and it was working out how many times

1314
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
and it was working out how many times
 

1315
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,389
and it was working out how many times
that uh

1316
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:26,399
that uh
 

1317
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,430
that uh
that we could divide well to to get

1318
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
that we could divide well to to get
 

1319
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,830
that we could divide well to to get
the number of the characters out because

1320
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
the number of the characters out because
 

1321
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,710
the number of the characters out because
it was out there

1322
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
it was out there
 

1323
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,669
it was out there
because they did in another river so we

1324
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679
because they did in another river so we
 

1325
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,830
because they did in another river so we
would just talk to frequent now and she

1326
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:37,840
would just talk to frequent now and she
 

1327
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,149
would just talk to frequent now and she
did

1328
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
did
 

1329
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,630
did
that she worked for well off the

1330
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
that she worked for well off the
 

1331
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,269
that she worked for well off the
government

1332
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
government
 

1333
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,190
government
produced because of the i'm not saying

1334
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
produced because of the i'm not saying
 

1335
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,950
produced because of the i'm not saying
more about that okay

1336
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
more about that okay
 

1337
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,230
more about that okay
and uh she said that that would work

1338
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
and uh she said that that would work
 

1339
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,110
and uh she said that that would work
very well

1340
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,120
very well
 

1341
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,710
very well
we also just we also took the table

1342
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
we also just we also took the table
 

1343
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,110
we also just we also took the table
which is all the other letters in that

1344
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
which is all the other letters in that
 

1345
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,389
which is all the other letters in that
you use and

1346
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
you use and
 

1347
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,110
you use and
mix them up as well so it makes it more

1348
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,120
mix them up as well so it makes it more
 

1349
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,230
mix them up as well so it makes it more
more difficult to

1350
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
more difficult to
 

1351
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,510
more difficult to
uh them to break so yeah that's it so

1352
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,520
uh them to break so yeah that's it so
 

1353
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,909
uh them to break so yeah that's it so
you have two things you have a password

1354
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
you have two things you have a password
 

1355
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,549
you have two things you have a password
and the number which is the big sub

1356
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
and the number which is the big sub
 

1357
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,710
and the number which is the big sub
value you know we mixed up the thing

1358
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:10,720
value you know we mixed up the thing
 

1359
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,549
value you know we mixed up the thing
then perspective um

1360
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:14,559
then perspective um
 

1361
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,310
then perspective um
i've got the tools code if you want to

1362
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
i've got the tools code if you want to
 

1363
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,870
i've got the tools code if you want to
see the source code in pasco or

1364
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
see the source code in pasco or
 

1365
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,830
see the source code in pasco or
they're dropping in on on that within a

1366
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
they're dropping in on on that within a
 

1367
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,750
they're dropping in on on that within a
zip code for everyone

1368
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
zip code for everyone
 

1369
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,789
zip code for everyone
and they're sure yeah yeah and and the

1370
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
and they're sure yeah yeah and and the
 

1371
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,830
and they're sure yeah yeah and and the
the uh

1372
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:27,840
the uh
 

1373
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,510
the uh
the other comments about the other thing

1374
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
the other comments about the other thing
 

1375
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,149
the other comments about the other thing
was that uh it was just a name i thought

1376
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159
was that uh it was just a name i thought
 

1377
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,430
was that uh it was just a name i thought
of at the time

1378
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
of at the time
 

1379
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,990
of at the time
it'll go at microsoft a wee bit about

1380
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,000
it'll go at microsoft a wee bit about
 

1381
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,789
it'll go at microsoft a wee bit about
the um

1382
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
the um
 

1383
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,430
the um
oh yeah the uh what is it network

1384
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
oh yeah the uh what is it network
 

1385
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,269
oh yeah the uh what is it network
hack.xy or something like that

1386
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
hack.xy or something like that
 

1387
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,389
hack.xy or something like that
yeah yeah yeah i get that yeah yeah i i

1388
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
yeah yeah yeah i get that yeah yeah i i
 

1389
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,510
yeah yeah yeah i get that yeah yeah i i
knew it was but

1390
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
knew it was but
 

1391
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,110
knew it was but
you you said you could have called it i

1392
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,120
you you said you could have called it i
 

1393
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,549
you you said you could have called it i
hate windows but there are so many

1394
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
hate windows but there are so many
 

1395
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,990
hate windows but there are so many
executables called that

1396
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
executables called that
 

1397
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,470
executables called that
that it won't matter anyway it'll get

1398
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
that it won't matter anyway it'll get
 

1399
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,880
that it won't matter anyway it'll get
lost

1400
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:52,890
lost
 

1401
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,190
lost
[Laughter]

1402
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
[Laughter]
 

1403
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:11,029
[Laughter]
but i wouldn't repeat it but

1404
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039

 

1405
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,149

have a password uh generator uh that i

1406
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
have a password uh generator uh that i
 

1407
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:14,710
have a password uh generator uh that i
use

1408
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
use
 

1409
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,630
use
uh it's called apg it's a linux based uh

1410
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
uh it's called apg it's a linux based uh
 

1411
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,950
uh it's called apg it's a linux based uh
command line uh something but it's it

1412
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
command line uh something but it's it
 

1413
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,310
command line uh something but it's it
that generates a

1414
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,320
that generates a
 

1415
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,630
that generates a
uh a random password that you can

1416
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
uh a random password that you can
 

1417
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,070
uh a random password that you can
actually

1418
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
actually
 

1419
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,789
actually
pronounce um oh yeah yeah yeah well

1420
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
pronounce um oh yeah yeah yeah well
 

1421
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,789
pronounce um oh yeah yeah yeah well
again my password generated that my

1422
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:30,799
again my password generated that my
 

1423
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,950
again my password generated that my
password manager does the same thing you

1424
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
password manager does the same thing you
 

1425
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,549
password manager does the same thing you
have an option when you generate a

1426
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
have an option when you generate a
 

1427
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,070
have an option when you generate a
password to say do you want the thing to

1428
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080
password to say do you want the thing to
 

1429
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,350
password to say do you want the thing to
be pronounceable

1430
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
be pronounceable
 

1431
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,430
be pronounceable
and if so it will generate passwords

1432
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
and if so it will generate passwords
 

1433
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,389
and if so it will generate passwords
like that

1434
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
like that
 

1435
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,789
like that
yeah the the the benefit of that is uh

1436
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799
yeah the the the benefit of that is uh
 

1437
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,909
yeah the the the benefit of that is uh
it's easier for you

1438
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:43,919
it's easier for you
 

1439
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,909
it's easier for you
for you to remember and it's still a

1440
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
for you to remember and it's still a
 

1441
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,310
for you to remember and it's still a
good password mind uses a clipboard to

1442
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
good password mind uses a clipboard to
 

1443
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,389
good password mind uses a clipboard to
transfer this from the password you

1444
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
transfer this from the password you
 

1445
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,510
transfer this from the password you
wanted to

1446
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
wanted to
 

1447
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,669
wanted to
to that to the to the device you want to

1448
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
to that to the to the device you want to
 

1449
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,830
to that to the to the device you want to
put the password

1450
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
put the password
 

1451
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,909
put the password
i think i have some uh between 20 and 30

1452
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
i think i have some uh between 20 and 30
 

1453
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,750
i think i have some uh between 20 and 30
and a different password i have a

1454
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
and a different password i have a
 

1455
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,510
and a different password i have a
different password for everything

1456
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520
different password for everything
 

1457
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,430
different password for everything
and i have everything in in my head

1458
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
and i have everything in in my head
 

1459
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,110
and i have everything in in my head
because i have a system for how

1460
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,120
because i have a system for how
 

1461
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,950
because i have a system for how
how i am yeah yeah absolutely

1462
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
how i am yeah yeah absolutely
 

1463

we're going to edit out some of the

1470
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
we're going to edit out some of the
 

1471
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,149
we're going to edit out some of the
