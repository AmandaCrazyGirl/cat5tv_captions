00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
and
 

165
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,309
and
other resistors here as well that are um

166
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
other resistors here as well that are um
 

167
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,229
other resistors here as well that are um
that show obvious burn marks

168
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
that show obvious burn marks
 

169
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,070
that show obvious burn marks
so anyway that's my next thing um

170
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
so anyway that's my next thing um
 

171
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,270
so anyway that's my next thing um
so i may have to i mean i don't know yet

172
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
so i may have to i mean i don't know yet
 

173
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,190
so i may have to i mean i don't know yet
if that i see's any good if the ic is

174
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
if that i see's any good if the ic is
 

175
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,030
if that i see's any good if the ic is
bad i may replace it with an arduino or

176
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
bad i may replace it with an arduino or
 

177
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,470
bad i may replace it with an arduino or
something put a socket in there and

178
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
something put a socket in there and
 

179
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,070
something put a socket in there and
put an arduino in its place

180
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080

 

181
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,070

you just need to add a bm something

182
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
you just need to add a bm something
 

183
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,110
you just need to add a bm something
and then you have an icbm yeah

184
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
and then you have an icbm yeah
 

185
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,670
and then you have an icbm yeah
true enough yeah that's true yeah you're

186
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
true enough yeah that's true yeah you're
 

187
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,789
true enough yeah that's true yeah you're
right

188
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
right
 

189
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,869
right
um so i wanted to to touch base with you

190
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
um so i wanted to to touch base with you
 

191
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,229
um so i wanted to to touch base with you
about my client server um that i'm

192
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
about my client server um that i'm
 

193
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,270
about my client server um that i'm
writing

194
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
writing
 

195
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,630
writing
because i cannot get signatures to work

196
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
because i cannot get signatures to work
 

197
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,750
because i cannot get signatures to work
reliably

198
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
reliably
 

199
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,789
reliably
i can if i can all i can do all day

200
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
i can if i can all i can do all day
 

201
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,830
i can if i can all i can do all day
i can encrypt a user i can encrypt the

202
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
i can encrypt a user i can encrypt the
 

203
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,229
i can encrypt a user i can encrypt the
payload

204
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
payload
 

205
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,670
payload
so say the client has the public key

206
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
so say the client has the public key
 

207
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,789
so say the client has the public key
of the server and has its own

208
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
of the server and has its own
 

209
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,830
of the server and has its own
private key and say the server has the

210
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840

 

211
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,630

public key of the user and its own

212
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
public key of the user and its own
 

213
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,589
public key of the user and its own
private key

214
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
private key
 

215
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,110
private key
right so the private keys belong to the

216
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
right so the private keys belong to the
 

217
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,150
right so the private keys belong to the
to the um parties that they they should

218
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
to the um parties that they they should
 

219
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,510
to the um parties that they they should
belong to

220
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
belong to
 

221
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,189
belong to
if the client encrypts

222
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
if the client encrypts
 

223
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,510
if the client encrypts
uh uh encrypts the payload with the

224
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
uh uh encrypts the payload with the
 

225
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,629
uh uh encrypts the payload with the
service public key and then the server

226
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
service public key and then the server
 

227
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,749
service public key and then the server
encrypts the reply with the client

228
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
encrypts the reply with the client
 

229
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,670
encrypts the reply with the client
public key would that be enough in your

230
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
public key would that be enough in your
 

231
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,710
public key would that be enough in your
opinion

232
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
opinion
 

233
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,189
opinion
to prove that this is the right person

234
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
to prove that this is the right person
 

235
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,710
to prove that this is the right person
that this is the correct

236
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
that this is the correct
 

237
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,430
that this is the correct
correctly i mean that would correctly

238
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
correctly i mean that would correctly
 

239
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,150
correctly i mean that would correctly
encrypt

240
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
encrypt
 

241
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,670
encrypt
that would allow proper encrypt and

242
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
that would allow proper encrypt and
 

243
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,990
that would allow proper encrypt and
decrypt across the wire all the time

244
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
decrypt across the wire all the time
 

245
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,510
decrypt across the wire all the time
but would that be enough do you think to

246
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
but would that be enough do you think to
 

247
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,350
but would that be enough do you think to
identify that person

248
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
identify that person
 

249
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,590
identify that person
i'm not sure that is how it's supposed

250
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
i'm not sure that is how it's supposed
 

251
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,950
i'm not sure that is how it's supposed
to work and

252
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
to work and
 

253
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,469
to work and
that kind of setup indicates that

254
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
that kind of setup indicates that
 

255
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,350
that kind of setup indicates that
the client sends some a message

256
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
the client sends some a message
 

257
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,150
the client sends some a message
somewhere

258
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
somewhere
 

259
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,110
somewhere
and then later on maybe an hour later

260
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
and then later on maybe an hour later
 

261
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,629
and then later on maybe an hour later
then

262
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
then
 

263
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,110
then
the reply is coming back but it's an

264
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
the reply is coming back but it's an
 

265
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,070
the reply is coming back but it's an
instant connection

266
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
instant connection
 

267
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,670
instant connection
where he sends the server message a

268
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
where he sends the server message a
 

269
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,870
where he sends the server message a
command to

270
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
command to
 

271
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,510
command to
do something and then get an instant

272
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
do something and then get an instant
 

273
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,070
do something and then get an instant

274
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
replay
 

275
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,590

then only the the service uh and

276
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
then only the the service uh and
 

277
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,230
then only the the service uh and
the key is is all that matters your

278
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
the key is is all that matters your
 

279
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,990
the key is is all that matters your
client doesn't have need any

280
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
client doesn't have need any
 

281
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,629
client doesn't have need any
kids with them yeah but that's that but

282
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
kids with them yeah but that's that but
 

283
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,430
kids with them yeah but that's that but
but

284
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
but
 

285
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,310
but
apart from encrypting the communication

286
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
apart from encrypting the communication
 

287
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,550
apart from encrypting the communication
i

288
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
i
 

289
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,749
i
also want to prove that the person

290
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
also want to prove that the person
 

291
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,029
also want to prove that the person
who i'm asserting i am is that

292
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
who i'm asserting i am is that
 

293
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,110
who i'm asserting i am is that
you know is that person to the server

294
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
you know is that person to the server
 

295
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,029
you know is that person to the server
right

296
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
right
 

297
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,790
right
so if i want to if i want to say i'm

298
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
so if i want to if i want to say i'm
 

299
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,830
so if i want to if i want to say i'm
user id123

300
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
user id123
 

301
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,390
user id123
right i want to i want to prove to the

302
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
right i want to i want to prove to the
 

303
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,870
right i want to i want to prove to the
server that i'm user id123 but all i

304
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
server that i'm user id123 but all i
 

305
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,710
server that i'm user id123 but all i
have is my own private key

306
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
have is my own private key
 

307
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,029
have is my own private key
and the service public key and the

308
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
and the service public key and the
 

309
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,990
and the service public key and the
server

310
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
server
 

311
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,870
server
has its own private key and my public

312
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
has its own private key and my public
 

313
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,230
has its own private key and my public
key

314
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
key
 

315
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,189
key
so it can encrypt with my public key

316
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
so it can encrypt with my public key
 

317
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,150
so it can encrypt with my public key
and i can decrypt with my private key

318
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
and i can decrypt with my private key
 

319
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,189
and i can decrypt with my private key
see what i'm saying

320
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
see what i'm saying
 

321
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,350
see what i'm saying
yeah in order for you for the server to

322
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
yeah in order for you for the server to
 

323
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,390
yeah in order for you for the server to
know that

324
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
know that
 

325
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,909
know that
the message is coming from you and not

326
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
the message is coming from you and not
 

327
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,670
the message is coming from you and not
someone else then you in addition to it

328
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
someone else then you in addition to it
 

329
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,710
someone else then you in addition to it
and then

330
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
and then
 

331
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,230
and then
encrypting the message you have to

332
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
encrypting the message you have to
 

333
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,990
encrypting the message you have to
assign the message with your

334
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
assign the message with your
 

335
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,550
assign the message with your
publication yeah unfortunately signing

publication yeah unfortunately signing
isn't working

338
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
isn't working
 

339
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,870
isn't working
because i am not able to

340
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
because i am not able to
 

341
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,749
because i am not able to
uh i am not able to reliably sign every

342
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
uh i am not able to reliably sign every
 

343
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,309
uh i am not able to reliably sign every
time

344
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
time
 

345
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,670
time
for some reason using the using the

346
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
for some reason using the using the
 

347
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,550
for some reason using the using the
gcrypt library signing does not work

348
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
gcrypt library signing does not work
 

349
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,670
gcrypt library signing does not work
every time

350
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
every time
 

351
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,749
every time
anyway that's that's something we can

352
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
anyway that's that's something we can
 

353
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,430
anyway that's that's something we can
discuss later if you like

354
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
discuss later if you like
 

355
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,150
discuss later if you like
um but i was i wanted to get your input

356
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
um but i was i wanted to get your input
 

357
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,589
um but i was i wanted to get your input
on that and i agree with you i would

358
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
on that and i agree with you i would
 

359
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,950
on that and i agree with you i would
rather sign

360
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
rather sign
 

361
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,710
rather sign
that sign and encrypt but i don't think

362
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
that sign and encrypt but i don't think
 

363
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,629
that sign and encrypt but i don't think
that's going to work so

364
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
that's going to work so
 

365
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,749
that's going to work so
this one can't do it this is to

366
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
this one can't do it this is to
 

367
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,749
this one can't do it this is to
come into the end of the kind of uh

368
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
come into the end of the kind of uh
 

369
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,390
come into the end of the kind of uh
advice that you need you need someone

370
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
advice that you need you need someone
 

371
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,909
advice that you need you need someone
who actually works

372
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919

 

373
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,110

with the uh encrypting

374
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
with the uh encrypting
 

375
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,070
with the uh encrypting
in order to yeah yeah okay

376
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080

 

377
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,309

maybe you are using their own

378
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319

 

379
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,950

encryption tools oh sure it's certainly

380
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
encryption tools oh sure it's certainly
 

381
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,670
encryption tools oh sure it's certainly
possible

382
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
possible
 

383
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,150
possible
it's certainly possible um i thought i

384
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
it's certainly possible um i thought i
 

385
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,309
it's certainly possible um i thought i
was using the same library that tls is

386
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
was using the same library that tls is
 

387
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,790
was using the same library that tls is
using

388
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
using
 

389
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,189
using
but uh um what is it called open ssh

390
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
but uh um what is it called open ssh
 

391
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,189
but uh um what is it called open ssh
i think that's right open ssl is the one

392
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
i think that's right open ssl is the one
 

393
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,870
i think that's right open ssl is the one
that everyone is using finish the show

394
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
that everyone is using finish the show
 

395
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,510
that everyone is using finish the show
yeah okay yeah but um implement that

396
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
yeah okay yeah but um implement that
 

397
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,029
yeah okay yeah but um implement that
there quickly and

398
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
there quickly and
 

399
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,510
there quickly and
oh sure oh i absolutely i absolutely

400
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
oh sure oh i absolutely i absolutely
 

401
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,029
oh sure oh i absolutely i absolutely
admit i may have implemented that

402
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
admit i may have implemented that
 

403
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,950
admit i may have implemented that
incorrectly i'm more than happy to admit

404
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
incorrectly i'm more than happy to admit
 

405

well um the saga of my raspberry pi

732
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
well um the saga of my raspberry pi
 

733
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,069
well um the saga of my raspberry pi
continues

734

i was going to ask about that keyboard

736
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
i was going to ask about that keyboard
 

737
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,189
i was going to ask about that keyboard
yeah

738
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
yeah
 

739
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,069
yeah
well the that uh little keyboard that i

740
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
well the that uh little keyboard that i
 

741
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,110
well the that uh little keyboard that i
showed you

742
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
showed you
 

743
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,990
showed you
um wasn't working so i bought a

744
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
um wasn't working so i bought a
 

745
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,790
um wasn't working so i bought a
bluetooth keyboard and connected it to

746
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
bluetooth keyboard and connected it to
 

747
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,030
bluetooth keyboard and connected it to
my raspberry pi but that kept losing its

748
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
my raspberry pi but that kept losing its
 

749
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,470
my raspberry pi but that kept losing its
pairing

750
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
pairing
 

751
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,509
pairing
so i had that like a day i sent it back

752
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
so i had that like a day i sent it back
 

753
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,590
so i had that like a day i sent it back
two days after i got it

754
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
two days after i got it
 

755
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,550
two days after i got it
um and i've got another keyboard that i

756
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
um and i've got another keyboard that i
 

757
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,550
um and i've got another keyboard that i
got this morning

758
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
got this morning
 

759
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,629
got this morning
and i'm going to see how that works oh

760
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
and i'm going to see how that works oh
 

761
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,189
and i'm going to see how that works oh
wow i'm charging it right now and

762
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
wow i'm charging it right now and
 

763
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,870
wow i'm charging it right now and
it didn't do anything when i first got

764
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
it didn't do anything when i first got
 

765
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,710
it didn't do anything when i first got
it so i figured

766
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
it so i figured
 

767
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,710
it so i figured
no luck with keyboards are you needed to

768
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
no luck with keyboards are you needed to
 

769
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,750
no luck with keyboards are you needed to
be charged

770
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
be charged
 

771
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,750
be charged
well it's because it's a raspberry pi i

772
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
well it's because it's a raspberry pi i
 

773
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,189
well it's because it's a raspberry pi i
think

774
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
think
 

775
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,790
think
well maybe what you need to do is get

776
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
well maybe what you need to do is get
 

777
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,870
well maybe what you need to do is get
you one of those raspberry pi 400s with

778
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
you one of those raspberry pi 400s with
 

779
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,629
you one of those raspberry pi 400s with
the keyboard and everything all built in

780
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639

 

781
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,310

well then i did yeah i could do that i

782
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
well then i did yeah i could do that i
 

783
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,110
well then i did yeah i could do that i
suppose

784
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
suppose
 

785
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,230
suppose
i don't know if there's any way to

786
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
i don't know if there's any way to
 

787
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,150
i don't know if there's any way to
connect it wirelessly to my

788
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
connect it wirelessly to my
 

789
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,269
connect it wirelessly to my
tv though i believe it's a standard

790
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
tv though i believe it's a standard
 

791
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,389
tv though i believe it's a standard
raspberry pi inside um

792
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
raspberry pi inside um
 

793
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,590
raspberry pi inside um
that would be another question for

794
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
that would be another question for
 

795
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,949
that would be another question for
robbie but you know he keeps

796
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
robbie but you know he keeps
 

797
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,030
robbie but you know he keeps
i'm trying to not have to run cables to

798
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
i'm trying to not have to run cables to
 

799
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,150
i'm trying to not have to run cables to
my

800

805
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,629
you know from the computer to the tv and
i guess you want the raspberry pi to be

806
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
i guess you want the raspberry pi to be
 

807
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,150
i guess you want the raspberry pi to be
near the tv because it's going to serve

808
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
near the tv because it's going to serve
 

809
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,150
near the tv because it's going to serve
as the media center right

810
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
as the media center right
 

811
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,870

813
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,550
i'm sorry i think it's uh you want the
raspberry pi to be near your

814
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
raspberry pi to be near your
 

815
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,829
