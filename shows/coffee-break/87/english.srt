there
you're gonna you're gonna stand it up

72
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
you're gonna you're gonna stand it up
 

73
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,870
you're gonna you're gonna stand it up
high then or do you have to climb to get

74
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
high then or do you have to climb to get
 

75
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,990
high then or do you have to climb to get
to it or

76
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
to it or
 

77
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,990
to it or
no oh no it's not very high it's

78
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
no oh no it's not very high it's
 

79
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
no oh no it's not very high it's
probably about body height

80
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
probably about body height
 

81
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,830
probably about body height
probably about weight side but it's not

82
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
probably about weight side but it's not
 

83
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,149
probably about weight side but it's not
okay to be turned up so i don't see

mount the thing outside as that was so
 

167
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,430
mount the thing outside as that was so
you could only have

168
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
you could only have
 

169
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,390
you could only have
one coax running from your shack to the

170
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
one coax running from your shack to the
 

171
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,350
one coax running from your shack to the
to the tower

172
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
to the tower
 

173
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,190
to the tower
and then let it switch out to whatever

174
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
and then let it switch out to whatever
 

175
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,110
and then let it switch out to whatever
antennas you've got on the tower

176
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
antennas you've got on the tower
 

177
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,070
antennas you've got on the tower
yeah okay okay because you could have

178
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
yeah okay okay because you could have
 

179
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,990
yeah okay okay because you could have
run all those collapses right into your

180
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
run all those collapses right into your
 

181
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,630
run all those collapses right into your
shack right

182
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
shack right
 

183
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,030
shack right
but about problems with the wife because

184
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
but about problems with the wife because
 

185
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,390
but about problems with the wife because
you're going the obviously and

186
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
you're going the obviously and
 

187
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,550
you're going the obviously and
trips over but she does what she do

188
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
trips over but she does what she do
 

189
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,910
trips over but she does what she do
i don't just keep them behind the

190
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
i don't just keep them behind the
 

191
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,990
i don't just keep them behind the
greenhouse but uh it seems

192
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
greenhouse but uh it seems
 

193
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,030
greenhouse but uh it seems
so you know it's uh to make things a bit

194
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
so you know it's uh to make things a bit
 

195
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,869
so you know it's uh to make things a bit
neater so i want to run one guy could be

196
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
neater so i want to run one guy could be
 

197
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,270
neater so i want to run one guy could be
on the greenhouse everybody

198
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
on the greenhouse everybody
 

199
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,190
on the greenhouse everybody
is exactly that way you know yep you

200
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
is exactly that way you know yep you
 

201
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,030
is exactly that way you know yep you
have to check stanley at the moment

202
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
have to check stanley at the moment
 

203
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,069
have to check stanley at the moment
you probably know got a radio yeah yeah

204
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
you probably know got a radio yeah yeah
 

205
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,509
you probably know got a radio yeah yeah
yeah yeah

206
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
yeah yeah
 

207
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,189
yeah yeah
oh nice what is that a yeshu

208
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
oh nice what is that a yeshu
 

209
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,230
oh nice what is that a yeshu
or a kenwood or what a 102

210
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
or a kenwood or what a 102
 

211
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,110
or a kenwood or what a 102
yay 102 yeah it's well but it's got a

212
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
yay 102 yeah it's well but it's got a
 

213
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,629
yay 102 yeah it's well but it's got a
good receiver on there there's nothing

214
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
good receiver on there there's nothing
 

215
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,270
good receiver on there there's nothing
wrong with

216
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
wrong with
 

217
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,030
wrong with
yeah nothing wrong with old radios

218
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
yeah nothing wrong with old radios
 

219
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,550
yeah nothing wrong with old radios
nothing wrong with those i

220
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
nothing wrong with those i
 

221
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,350
nothing wrong with those i
i think it's got a good uh

222
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
i think it's got a good uh
 

223
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,390
i think it's got a good uh
across about uh uh in fact he doesn't

224
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
across about uh uh in fact he doesn't
 

225
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,629
across about uh uh in fact he doesn't
get caught what's up

226
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
get caught what's up
 

227
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,749
get caught what's up
so much it's yeah it's got bad stuff

228
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
so much it's yeah it's got bad stuff
 

229
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,590
so much it's yeah it's got bad stuff
we've got balanced mixer the bench fed

230
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
we've got balanced mixer the bench fed
 

231
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,950
we've got balanced mixer the bench fed
to the front so it's pretty

232
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
to the front so it's pretty
 

233
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,030
to the front so it's pretty
sure it's already pulled through i'm not

234
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
sure it's already pulled through i'm not
 

235
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,990
sure it's already pulled through i'm not
if a sure runs floor under watts and uh

236
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
if a sure runs floor under watts and uh
 

237
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,710
if a sure runs floor under watts and uh
and more

238
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
and more
 

239
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,550
and more
which they haven't got by their license

240
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
which they haven't got by their license
 

241
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,550
which they haven't got by their license
but we won't talk about that one right

242
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
but we won't talk about that one right
 

243
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,189
but we won't talk about that one right
right right

244
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
right right
 

245
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,710
right right
right yeah yeah yeah yep

246
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
right yeah yeah yeah yep
 

247
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,790
right yeah yeah yeah yep
so here's what i think the good thing

248
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
so here's what i think the good thing
 

249
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,230
so here's what i think the good thing
about old equipment uh

250
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
about old equipment uh
 

251
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,150
about old equipment uh
really all the equipment is that they

252
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
really all the equipment is that they
 

253
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,029
really all the equipment is that they
are not uh susceptible to uh damage from

254
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
are not uh susceptible to uh damage from
 

255
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,469
are not uh susceptible to uh damage from
uh

256
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
uh
 

257
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,270
uh
solar storms and that can damage their

258
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
solar storms and that can damage their
 

259
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,830
solar storms and that can damage their
chips

260
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
chips
 

261
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,749
chips
because a lot a lot of old equipment

262
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
because a lot a lot of old equipment
 

263
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,990
because a lot a lot of old equipment
doesn't have a single chip in them

264
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
doesn't have a single chip in them
 

265
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,310
doesn't have a single chip in them
yes that's true they're all valve

266
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
yes that's true they're all valve
 

267
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,070
yes that's true they're all valve
they're all valve operated or yeah

268
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
they're all valve operated or yeah
 

269
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,629
they're all valve operated or yeah
that's got a transistor input transit a

270
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
that's got a transistor input transit a
 

271
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,150
that's got a transistor input transit a
radio bar

272
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
radio bar
 

273
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,070
radio bar
and a valve for a pa on it

274
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
and a valve for a pa on it
 

275
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,870
and a valve for a pa on it
most of the most radios these days have

276
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
most of the most radios these days have
 

277
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,670
most of the most radios these days have
the uh

278
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
the uh
 

279
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,990
the uh
the final transistors you know that

280
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
the final transistors you know that
 

281
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,990
the final transistors you know that
those those finals tend to be

282
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
those those finals tend to be
 

283
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,029
those those finals tend to be
high power transistors right you um

284
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
high power transistors right you um
 

285
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,830
high power transistors right you um
you do you agree peter or no yeah yeah

286
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
you do you agree peter or no yeah yeah
 

287
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,790
you do you agree peter or no yeah yeah
yeah

288
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
yeah
 

289
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,230
yeah
but now i don't know whether they're

290
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
but now i don't know whether they're
 

291
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,070
but now i don't know whether they're
susceptible to emp or

292
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
susceptible to emp or
 

293
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,909
susceptible to emp or
or anything like that so they're very

294
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
or anything like that so they're very
 

295
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,590
or anything like that so they're very
acceptable to everything those things

296
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
acceptable to everything those things
 

297
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,909
acceptable to everything those things
are

298
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
are
 

299
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,029
are
there they break

300
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
there they break
 

301
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,029
there they break
yeah yeah well yeah

302
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
yeah yeah well yeah
 

303
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,990
yeah yeah well yeah
it's always true all right so doug's not

304
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
it's always true all right so doug's not
 

305
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,749
it's always true all right so doug's not
here but i was going to show him

306
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
here but i was going to show him
 

307
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,390
here but i was going to show him
um the the keyboard that that i was

308
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
um the the keyboard that that i was
 

309
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,230
um the the keyboard that that i was
talking about last um

310
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
talking about last um
 

311
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,950
talking about last um
last week but i'll show you guys and

312
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
last week but i'll show you guys and
 

313
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,710
last week but i'll show you guys and
maybe doug cook and we'll catch up on it

314
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
maybe doug cook and we'll catch up on it
 

315
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,670
maybe doug cook and we'll catch up on it
later

316
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
later
 

317
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,749
later
there it is okay now on to the next

318
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
there it is okay now on to the next
 

319
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,230
there it is okay now on to the next
thing

320
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240

 

321
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,790

what's that it looks like a wallet well

322
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
what's that it looks like a wallet well
 

323
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,830
what's that it looks like a wallet well
yeah i know

324
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
yeah i know
 

325
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,749
yeah i know
it looks like a wallet but it's not

326
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
it looks like a wallet but it's not
 

327
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,950
it looks like a wallet but it's not
everything

328
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
everything
 

329
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,309
everything
if i do that and then that what we get

330
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
if i do that and then that what we get
 

331
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,350
if i do that and then that what we get
is this and we go down to where it is

332
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
is this and we go down to where it is
 

333
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,150
is this and we go down to where it is
and it's called think outside that's the

334
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
and it's called think outside that's the
 

335
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,790
and it's called think outside that's the
brand

336
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
brand
 

337
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,670
brand
right and i think the full brand name is

338
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
right and i think the full brand name is
 

339
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:47,990
right and i think the full brand name is
think

340
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
think
 

341
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,070
think
outside the box but what happens here is

342
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
outside the box but what happens here is
 

343
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,430
outside the box but what happens here is
you

344
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
you
 

345
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,150
you
well i i need to do it so you can see it

346
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160

 

347
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,510

you do that and then you do this

348
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
you do that and then you do this
 

349
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,510
you do that and then you do this
whoops and then the keyboard opens up

350
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
whoops and then the keyboard opens up
 

351
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,550
whoops and then the keyboard opens up
nice completely opens up to an almost

352
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
nice completely opens up to an almost
 

353
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,870
nice completely opens up to an almost
full-size keyboard

354
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880

 

355
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,430

now it uses it uses blue function keys

356
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
now it uses it uses blue function keys
 

357
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,749
now it uses it uses blue function keys
and green function keys to get you extra

358
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
and green function keys to get you extra
 

359
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,589
and green function keys to get you extra
functions all over the place here so um

360
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
functions all over the place here so um
 

361
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,909
functions all over the place here so um
i i promised him that i would try this

362
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
i i promised him that i would try this
 

363
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,950
i i promised him that i would try this
on the raspberry pi

364
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
on the raspberry pi
 

365
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,590
on the raspberry pi
and i failed so i i suck

366
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:27,600
and i failed so i i suck
 

367
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,589
and i failed so i i suck
[Laughter]

368
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
[Laughter]
 

369
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,309
[Laughter]
i am i am not very reliable apparently

370
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
i am i am not very reliable apparently
 

371
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,870
i am i am not very reliable apparently
this week

372
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
this week
 

373
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,990
this week
but i am going to try this uh sometime

374
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
but i am going to try this uh sometime
 

375
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,589
but i am going to try this uh sometime
very very soon

376
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
very very soon
 

377
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,469
very very soon
i don't know whether the raspberry pi's

378
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
i don't know whether the raspberry pi's
 

379
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,710
i don't know whether the raspberry pi's
or which models of raspberry pi

380
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
or which models of raspberry pi
 

381
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,909
or which models of raspberry pi
have a bluetooth adapter built in

382
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
have a bluetooth adapter built in
 

383
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,629
have a bluetooth adapter built in
or not because if you search on the

384
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
or not because if you search on the
 

385
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,189
or not because if you search on the
internet

and by the way to close it up you just
 

389
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,749
and by the way to close it up you just
do this

390
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759

 

391
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,390

some um uh
 

395
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,430
some um uh
double ac aaa cells there are

396
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
double ac aaa cells there are
 

397
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,390
double ac aaa cells there are
two aaa cells in there so um

398
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
two aaa cells in there so um
 

399
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,629
two aaa cells in there so um
there are two aaa cells in there so that

400
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
there are two aaa cells in there so that
 

401
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,749
there are two aaa cells in there so that
um

402
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
um
 

403
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,070

405
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,430
we can what we do what we need to do
so reminds me of an old one a calculator

406
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
so reminds me of an old one a calculator
 

407
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,270
so reminds me of an old one a calculator
that we had at my old job

408
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
that we had at my old job
 

409
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,309
that we had at my old job
yeah it was uh um it was uh

410
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
yeah it was uh um it was uh
 

411
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,350
yeah it was uh um it was uh
it had a cover on it

412
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
it had a cover on it
 

413
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,629
it had a cover on it
and then and it had the cover had a

414
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
and then and it had the cover had a
 

415
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,110
and then and it had the cover had a
button

416

button
 

417
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,709
button
it was um it was uh i think it

418
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
it was um it was uh i think it
 

419
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,190
it was um it was uh i think it
either spring or it was some

420
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200

 

421
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,709

mechanical uh resistance that that

422
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
mechanical uh resistance that that
 

423
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,829
mechanical uh resistance that that
when you you push the button

424
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
when you you push the button
 

425

opens slightly and then it uh turn the
 

429
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,350
opens slightly and then it uh turn the
calculator upside down

430
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
calculator upside down
 

431
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,870
calculator upside down
ready for the cutlet to be used

432
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880

 

433
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,350

way back when and i still have this

434
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
way back when and i still have this
 

435
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,110
way back when and i still have this
calculator i don't know if it's any if

436
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
calculator i don't know if it's any if
 

437
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,870
calculator i don't know if it's any if
it's still any good or not but

438
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
it's still any good or not but
 

439
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,550
it's still any good or not but
um way back when i bought a radio shack

440
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
um way back when i bought a radio shack
 

441
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,590
um way back when i bought a radio shack
calculator that ran off a solar cell and

442
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
calculator that ran off a solar cell and
 

443
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,190
calculator that ran off a solar cell and
the um and the the radio

444
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
the um and the the radio
 

445
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,350
the um and the the radio
what it would do is it would open up it

446
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
what it would do is it would open up it
 

447
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,190
what it would do is it would open up it
was the cover was integrated

448
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
was the cover was integrated
 

449
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,110
was the cover was integrated
it was a plastic cover or vinyl cover it

450
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
it was a plastic cover or vinyl cover it
 

451
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,470
it was a plastic cover or vinyl cover it
was integrated

452
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
was integrated
 

453
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,550
was integrated
and you could use any of the function

454
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
and you could use any of the function
 

455
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,389
and you could use any of the function
keys on the cover as well

456
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
keys on the cover as well
 

457
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,110
keys on the cover as well
in order to drive the calculator yeah i

458
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
in order to drive the calculator yeah i
 

459
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,030
in order to drive the calculator yeah i
still i still like it i i mean i

460
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
still i still like it i i mean i
 

461
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,509
still i still like it i i mean i
if i could use it i would uh i would

462
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
if i could use it i would uh i would
 

463
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,990
if i could use it i would uh i would
continue to use it

464
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
continue to use it
 

465
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,430
continue to use it
this one right there i've been it's

466
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
this one right there i've been it's
 

467
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,110
this one right there i've been it's
actually very similar to that

468
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
actually very similar to that
 

469
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,070
actually very similar to that
except that it had a a vinyl cover on

470
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
except that it had a a vinyl cover on
 

471
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,990
except that it had a a vinyl cover on
the back that was integrated that opened

472
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
the back that was integrated that opened
 

473
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,670
the back that was integrated that opened
up and you had more function keys on

474
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
up and you had more function keys on
 

475
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:43,990
up and you had more function keys on
that

476
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
that
 

477
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,910
that
and uh yeah and he has a solar

478
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
and uh yeah and he has a solar
 

479
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,949
and uh yeah and he has a solar
panel here it charges the the battery on

480
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
panel here it charges the the battery on
 

481
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,870
panel here it charges the the battery on
the thing i have had this for

482
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
the thing i have had this for
 

483
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,110
the thing i have had this for
uh 15 years and the battery is

484
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
uh 15 years and the battery is
 

485
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,470
uh 15 years and the battery is
still works so yeah and i think mine has

486
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
still works so yeah and i think mine has
 

487
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,870
still works so yeah and i think mine has
been closed for so long that um

488
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
been closed for so long that um
 

489
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,389
been closed for so long that um
i think the battery is no good in it

490
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
i think the battery is no good in it
 

491
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,389
i think the battery is no good in it
anymore because it only works now

492
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399

it looks mine looks similar to this but

520
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
it looks mine looks similar to this but
 

521
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,310
it looks mine looks similar to this but
it's not the same thing

522
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
it's not the same thing
 

523

this is an old palm pilot but it looks

524
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
this is an old palm pilot but it looks
 

525
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:57,910
this is an old palm pilot but it looks
similar to that can you get it

526
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920

 

527

other things or something yeah
 

529
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,150
other things or something yeah
and uh they work well well on a batch of

530
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
and uh they work well well on a batch of
 

531
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,430
and uh they work well well on a batch of
time where they're connected well i was

532
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
time where they're connected well i was
 

533
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,389
time where they're connected well i was
trying to avoid

534
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
trying to avoid
 

535
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,710
trying to avoid
carrying battery packs around but um you

536
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
carrying battery packs around but um you
 

537
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,829
carrying battery packs around but um you
know i'm pretty much

538
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
know i'm pretty much
 

539
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,110
know i'm pretty much
my mindset on myself a flat battery on

540
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
my mindset on myself a flat battery on
 

541
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,990
my mindset on myself a flat battery on
one of these yellow

542
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
one of these yellow
 

543
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,949
one of these yellow
flat batteries yeah which is about about

544
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
flat batteries yeah which is about about
 

545
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,110
flat batteries yeah which is about about
a pack of cigarettes and it takes on to

546
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
a pack of cigarettes and it takes on to
 

547
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,069
a pack of cigarettes and it takes on to
the back

548
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
the back
 

549
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,269
the back
and yeah i never charge up yet

550
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
and yeah i never charge up yet
 

551
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,110
and yeah i never charge up yet
and i'm thinking about i'm thinking

552
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
and i'm thinking about i'm thinking
 

553
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,269
and i'm thinking about i'm thinking
about doing the same thing i bought a

554
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
about doing the same thing i bought a
 

555
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,550
about doing the same thing i bought a
battery pack off

556
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
battery pack off
 

557
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,829
battery pack off
amazon um and it just uh

558
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
amazon um and it just uh
 

559
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,829
amazon um and it just uh
see if i can focus you know i can't

560
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
see if i can focus you know i can't
 

561
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,190
see if i can focus you know i can't
because it won't

562
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
because it won't
 

563
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,590
because it won't
there we go there you go you can see the

564
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
there we go there you go you can see the
 

565
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,550
there we go there you go you can see the
inputs and the outputs now

566
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
inputs and the outputs now
 

567
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,829
inputs and the outputs now
the outputs i think are the um the large

568
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
the outputs i think are the um the large
 

569
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,550
the outputs i think are the um the large
usb

570
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
usb
 

571
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,269
usb
connectors over here and i think the

572
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
connectors over here and i think the
 

573
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,350
connectors over here and i think the
inputs are to charge it up

574
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
inputs are to charge it up
 

575
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,870
inputs are to charge it up
um and i would you know i would

576
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
um and i would you know i would
 

577
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,030
um and i would you know i would
plug this up to a raspberry pi or to an

578
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
plug this up to a raspberry pi or to an
 

579
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,069
plug this up to a raspberry pi or to an
arduino or

580
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
arduino or
 

581
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,350
arduino or
or to the phone to charge it up um or

582
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
or to the phone to charge it up um or
 

583
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,069
or to the phone to charge it up um or
if i'm going mobile with the raspberry

584
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
if i'm going mobile with the raspberry
 

585
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,590
if i'm going mobile with the raspberry
pi i would just

586
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
pi i would just
 

587
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,030
pi i would just
i would just use that as the power

588
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
i would just use that as the power
 

589
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,710
i would just use that as the power
supply

590
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
supply
 

591
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,190
supply
i was going to use that this is my uh

592
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
i was going to use that this is my uh
 

593
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,590
i was going to use that this is my uh
partner in a power bank it's a a very

594
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
partner in a power bank it's a a very
 

595
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,870
partner in a power bank it's a a very
big one you see

okay sorry peter what were you saying i
said those calculators one job thinking

620
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
said those calculators one job thinking
 

621
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,190
said those calculators one job thinking
about running

622
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
about running
 

623
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,110
about running
around hundreds of marker apps and they

624
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
around hundreds of marker apps and they
 

625
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,030
around hundreds of marker apps and they
last for a very long time oh yeah

626
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
last for a very long time oh yeah
 

627
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,350
last for a very long time oh yeah
oh yeah the thing i really liked about

628
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
oh yeah the thing i really liked about
 

629
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,350
oh yeah the thing i really liked about
this particular calculator

630
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
this particular calculator
 

631
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,710
this particular calculator
is that it would easily convert degrees

632
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
is that it would easily convert degrees
 

633
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,910
is that it would easily convert degrees
minutes and seconds

634
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
minutes and seconds
 

635
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,590
minutes and seconds
to decimal degrees i love that i i

636
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
to decimal degrees i love that i i
 

637
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,069
to decimal degrees i love that i i
i you know if i had a calculator that

638
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
i you know if i had a calculator that
 

639
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,670
i you know if i had a calculator that
would do that i would hold on to it

640
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
would do that i would hold on to it
 

641
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,430
would do that i would hold on to it
and i've held on to this one for that

642
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
and i've held on to this one for that
 

643
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,670
and i've held on to this one for that
reason because it's so easy to convert

644
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
reason because it's so easy to convert
 

645
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,110
reason because it's so easy to convert
from one to the other

646
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
from one to the other
 

647
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,389
from one to the other
i'm weird what can i tell you i'm i'm

648
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
i'm weird what can i tell you i'm i'm
 

649
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,509
i'm weird what can i tell you i'm i'm
like that uh yeah

650
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
like that uh yeah
 

651
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,550
like that uh yeah
and uh once you have fun something

652
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
and uh once you have fun something
 

653
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,750
and uh once you have fun something
that really works and it does the job

654
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
that really works and it does the job
 

655
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,110
that really works and it does the job

version of that data the problem is that

716
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
version of that data the problem is that
 

717
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,750
version of that data the problem is that
when you zoom out

718
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
when you zoom out
 

719
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,509
when you zoom out
really really far like to cover the

720
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
really really far like to cover the
 

721
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,030
really really far like to cover the
entire united states

722
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
entire united states
 

723
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,870
entire united states
it has to retrieve the entire data set

724
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
it has to retrieve the entire data set
 

725
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,509
it has to retrieve the entire data set
of hundreds of millions of records

726
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
of hundreds of millions of records
 

727
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:43,990
of hundreds of millions of records
because

728
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
because
 

729
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,629
because
each piece of each segment of road

730
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
each piece of each segment of road
 

731
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,870
each piece of each segment of road
whenever the road changes direction

732
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
whenever the road changes direction
 

733
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,990
whenever the road changes direction
each segment of r that's two segments

734
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
each segment of r that's two segments
 

735
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,710
each segment of r that's two segments
right

736
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
right
 

737
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,389
right
and so if there's a curve there are like

738
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
and so if there's a curve there are like
 

739
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,389
and so if there's a curve there are like
10 segments to describe that curve

740
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
10 segments to describe that curve
 

741
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,790
10 segments to describe that curve
and so it has to retrieve every single

742
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
and so it has to retrieve every single
 

743
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,550
and so it has to retrieve every single
one of them even if it wants to display

744
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
one of them even if it wants to display
 

745
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,030
one of them even if it wants to display
them

746
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
them
 

747
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,150
them
you know the whole thing at

748
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
you know the whole thing at
 

749
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,310
you know the whole thing at
full resolution what i've got to figure

750
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
full resolution what i've got to figure
 

751
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,470
full resolution what i've got to figure
out a way to do is to

752
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
out a way to do is to
 

753
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,550
out a way to do is to
come up with a set of low resolution

754
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
come up with a set of low resolution
 

755
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,750
come up with a set of low resolution
points

756
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
points
 

757
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,949
points
that can be called at the

758
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
that can be called at the
 

759
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,310
that can be called at the
full you know united states so that all

760
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
full you know united states so that all
 

761
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,230
full you know united states so that all
i draw is just like the interstates or

762
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
i draw is just like the interstates or
 

763
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,870
i draw is just like the interstates or
something

764
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
something
 

765
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,990
something
and just intermediate points from one

766
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
and just intermediate points from one
 

767
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,509
and just intermediate points from one
major point to the other

768
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
major point to the other
 

769
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,269
major point to the other
that'll make the retrieval data set a

770
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
that'll make the retrieval data set a
 

771
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,030
that'll make the retrieval data set a
whole lot smaller

772
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
whole lot smaller
 

773
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,710
whole lot smaller
and it'll display much quicker as a

774
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
and it'll display much quicker as a
 

775
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,430
and it'll display much quicker as a
result so anyway

776
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
result so anyway
 

777
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,829
result so anyway
lots of fun yeah i do all kinds of i

778
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
lots of fun yeah i do all kinds of i
 

779
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,350
lots of fun yeah i do all kinds of i
don't do all kinds of weird stuff what

780
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
don't do all kinds of weird stuff what
 

781
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,790
don't do all kinds of weird stuff what
can i tell you

782
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
can i tell you

mention to you
i did manage to get the client and the

790
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
i did manage to get the client and the
 

791
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,629
i did manage to get the client and the
server to talk to each other

792
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
server to talk to each other
 

793
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,790
server to talk to each other
i don't have the i don't have the

794
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
i don't have the i don't have the
 

795
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,389
i don't have the i don't have the
encryption piece done yet because i

796
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
encryption piece done yet because i
 

797
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,829
encryption piece done yet because i
decided what i needed to

798
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
decided what i needed to
 

799
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,269
decided what i needed to
to do was to uh uh implement and debug

800
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
to do was to uh uh implement and debug
 

801
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,389
to do was to uh uh implement and debug
the whole syncing

802
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
the whole syncing
 

803
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,710
the whole syncing
algorithm you know where the client

804
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
algorithm you know where the client
 

805
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,150
algorithm you know where the client
syncs up with the

806
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
syncs up with the
 

807
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,870
syncs up with the
with the server um so i'm still working

808
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
with the server um so i'm still working
 

809
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,069
with the server um so i'm still working
on that and i'm just leaving it

810
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
on that and i'm just leaving it
 

811
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,230
on that and i'm just leaving it
unencrypted for now but i do plan to

812
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
unencrypted for now but i do plan to
 

813
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,350
unencrypted for now but i do plan to
encrypt

814
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
encrypt
 

815
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,670
encrypt
but one of one of the things that i did

816
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
but one of one of the things that i did
 

817
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,189
but one of one of the things that i did
um when we talked

818
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
um when we talked
 

819
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,509
um when we talked
last week i absolutely agree with you

820
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
last week i absolutely agree with you
 

821
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,629
last week i absolutely agree with you
that the

822
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
that the
 

823
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,030
that the
encrypted package should be signed i

824
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
encrypted package should be signed i
 

825
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,629
encrypted package should be signed i
have no problem with that and i

826
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
have no problem with that and i
 

827
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,670
have no problem with that and i
ultimately want to do that but as an

828
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
ultimately want to do that but as an
 

829
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,590
ultimately want to do that but as an
interim since i haven't figured out how

830
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
interim since i haven't figured out how
 

831
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,430
interim since i haven't figured out how
to get around that

832
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
to get around that
 

833
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,030
to get around that
sometimes the signing works and

834
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
sometimes the signing works and
 

835
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,110
sometimes the signing works and
sometimes the signing doesn't

836
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
sometimes the signing doesn't
 

837
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,790
sometimes the signing doesn't
what i've done is is i'm making the

838
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
what i've done is is i'm making the
 

839
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,829
what i've done is is i'm making the
client solve a challenge that the server

840
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
client solve a challenge that the server
 

841
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,389
client solve a challenge that the server
sends based off of random numbers that

842
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
sends based off of random numbers that
 

843
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,069
sends based off of random numbers that
the server generates

844
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
the server generates
 

845
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,949
the server generates
at um in real time yeah

846
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
at um in real time yeah
 

847
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,150
at um in real time yeah
yes yes so the idea is the client says i

848
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
yes yes so the idea is the client says i
 

849
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,110
yes yes so the idea is the client says i
am user123 and the client and and the

850
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
am user123 and the client and and the
 

851
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,389
am user123 and the client and and the
server says

852
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
server says
 

853
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,829
server says
okay user123 prove it and

854
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
okay user123 prove it and
 

855
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,470
okay user123 prove it and
and and the server comes up with a

856
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
and and the server comes up with a
 

857
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,189
and and the server comes up with a
challenge that the client has to solve

858
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
challenge that the client has to solve
 

859
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,789
challenge that the client has to solve
based off of random numbers so it sends

860
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
based off of random numbers so it sends
 

861
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,710
based off of random numbers so it sends
so the server sends that challenge back

862
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
so the server sends that challenge back
 

863
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,829
so the server sends that challenge back
to the client

864
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
to the client
 

865
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,750
to the client
the client solves that challenge

866
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
the client solves that challenge
 

867
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,029
the client solves that challenge
and then uh sends its request at all in

868
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
and then uh sends its request at all in
 

869
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,510
and then uh sends its request at all in
the same

870
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
the same
 

871
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,230
the same
all in the same request and then the

872
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
all in the same request and then the
 

873
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,990
all in the same request and then the
server looks to see if the challenge was

874
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
server looks to see if the challenge was
 

875
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,429
server looks to see if the challenge was
correctly solved

876
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
correctly solved
 

877
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,110
correctly solved
and if it was correctly solved then it

878
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
and if it was correctly solved then it
 

879
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,630
and if it was correctly solved then it
says yep you're good

880
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
says yep you're good
 

881
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,950
says yep you're good
i'll accept your identity the thing is

882
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
i'll accept your identity the thing is
 

883
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,669
i'll accept your identity the thing is
that once i've

884
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
that once i've
 

885
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,029
that once i've
once i've implemented the encryption

886
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
once i've implemented the encryption
 

887
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,390
once i've implemented the encryption
that means multiple paths

888
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
that means multiple paths
 

889
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,830
that means multiple paths
multiple back and forth where the

890
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
multiple back and forth where the
 

891
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,669
multiple back and forth where the
server had to decrypt the packet

892
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
server had to decrypt the packet
 

893
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,470
server had to decrypt the packet
with the client's public key because the

894
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
with the client's public key because the
 

895
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,510
with the client's public key because the
client

896
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
client
 

897
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,830
client
encrypted with his private key and where

898
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
encrypted with his private key and where
 

899
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,669
encrypted with his private key and where
the client had to decrypt with the

900
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
the client had to decrypt with the
 

901
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,750
the client had to decrypt with the
service public key because the server

902
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
service public key because the server
 

903
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,350
service public key because the server
encrypted with the

904
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
encrypted with the
 

905
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,110
encrypted with the
service private key that makes sense

906
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
service private key that makes sense
 

907
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,470
service private key that makes sense
yeah you've got that backwards

908
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
yeah you've got that backwards
 

909
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,789
yeah you've got that backwards
yeah okay but the point is that they had

910
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
yeah okay but the point is that they had
 

911
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,150
yeah okay but the point is that they had
to use each other's key

912
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
to use each other's key
 

913
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,630
to use each other's key
to get the roundup to get the roundabout

914
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
to get the roundup to get the roundabout
 

915
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,789
to get the roundup to get the roundabout
um you know the back and forth to happen

916
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
um you know the back and forth to happen
 

917
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,789
um you know the back and forth to happen
multiple times the one having the the

918
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
multiple times the one having the the
 

919
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,510
multiple times the one having the the
private key

920
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
private key
 

921
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,470
private key
is the only entity who can and decrypt

922
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
is the only entity who can and decrypt
 

923
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,230
is the only entity who can and decrypt
anything used with that private key

924
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
anything used with that private key
 

925
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,630
anything used with that private key
so what you have what i think you're

926
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
so what you have what i think you're
 

927
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,510
so what you have what i think you're
doing is

928
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
doing is
 

929
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,230
doing is
um your client is using the service

930
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
um your client is using the service
 

931
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,190
um your client is using the service
public key

932
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
public key
 

933
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,029
public key
to create something that only this

934
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
to create something that only this
 

935
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,310
to create something that only this
correct yeah

936
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
correct yeah
 

937
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,870
correct yeah
correct yes yes otherwise i'm sorry if i

938
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
correct yes yes otherwise i'm sorry if i
 

939
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,430
correct yes yes otherwise i'm sorry if i
got it

940
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
got it
 

941
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,350
got it
i'm sorry if i got it the wrong way but

942
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
i'm sorry if i got it the wrong way but
 

943
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,470
i'm sorry if i got it the wrong way but
but the point of

944
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
but the point of
 

945
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,230
but the point of
the point of that conversation was to

946
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
the point of that conversation was to
 

947
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,430
the point of that conversation was to
say that there were multiple round trips

948
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
say that there were multiple round trips
 

949
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,990
say that there were multiple round trips
and both both sets of keys have to be

950
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
and both both sets of keys have to be
 

951
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,430
and both both sets of keys have to be
used in order for that

952
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
used in order for that
 

953
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,510
used in order for that
round trip to be successful that makes

954
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
round trip to be successful that makes
 

955
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,830
round trip to be successful that makes
sense

956
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840

 

957
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,990

yeah i mean depends on what kind of

958
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
yeah i mean depends on what kind of
 

959
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,590
yeah i mean depends on what kind of
authentication you you use but yes

960
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
authentication you you use but yes
 

961
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,070
authentication you you use but yes
yeah because you're having your your

962
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
yeah because you're having your your
 

963
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,950
yeah because you're having your your
public key

964
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
public key
 

965
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,430
public key
on the server and um

966
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440

 

967
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,549

it makes the the server and

968
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
it makes the the server and
 

969
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,950
it makes the the server and
then the server knows that whatever is

970
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
then the server knows that whatever is
 

971
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,150
then the server knows that whatever is
as uh

972
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
as uh
 

973
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,070
as uh
signed by this key uh is coming from um

974
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
signed by this key uh is coming from um
 

975
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,270
signed by this key uh is coming from um
the owner of that key

976
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
the owner of that key
 

977
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,470
the owner of that key
and yeah oh yeah yeah i agree that i

978
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
and yeah oh yeah yeah i agree that i
 

979
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,150
and yeah oh yeah yeah i agree that i
that it should be signed but i haven't

980
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
that it should be signed but i haven't
 

981
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,230
that it should be signed but i haven't
got the signing part working yet

982
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
got the signing part working yet
 

983
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,630
got the signing part working yet
and when i resolve that issue then i'll

984
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
and when i resolve that issue then i'll
 

985
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,070
and when i resolve that issue then i'll
be able to

986
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
be able to
 

987
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,310
be able to
then i'll be able to to you know

988
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
then i'll be able to to you know
 

989
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,789
then i'll be able to to you know
properly say yeah this is this is right

990
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
properly say yeah this is this is right
 

991
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,430
properly say yeah this is this is right
yeah you can look over to the time when

992
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
yeah you can look over to the time when
 

993
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,390
yeah you can look over to the time when
you think it's

994
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
you think it's
 

995
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,549
you think it's
ready for someone else else to test and

996
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
ready for someone else else to test and
 

997
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,390
ready for someone else else to test and
you put it on put it on github or

998
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
you put it on put it on github or
 

999
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,230
you put it on put it on github or
something and then you get yeah yeah

1000
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
something and then you get yeah yeah
 

1001
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,909
something and then you get yeah yeah
300 tickets uh telling you how stupid

1002
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
300 tickets uh telling you how stupid
 

1003
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,789
300 tickets uh telling you how stupid
that was

1004
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
that was
 

1005
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,230
that was
yeah i i know i know i know i know but

1006
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
yeah i i know i know i know i know but
 

1007
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,110
yeah i i know i know i know i know but
the

1008
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
the
 

1009
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,190
the
the big key for me is to make sure that

1010
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
the big key for me is to make sure that
 

1011
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,430
the big key for me is to make sure that
the the data is encrypted

1012
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
the the data is encrypted
 

1013
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,669
the the data is encrypted
from them that's that's the first thing

1014
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
from them that's that's the first thing
 

1015
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,710
from them that's that's the first thing
i have to do

1016
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
i have to do
 

1017
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,110
i have to do
and some of those s 300 will have a

1018
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
and some of those s 300 will have a
 

1019
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,950
and some of those s 300 will have a
suggestion so over how you can improve

1020
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
suggestion so over how you can improve
 

1021
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,590
suggestion so over how you can improve
that and maybe someone will have a patch

1022
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
that and maybe someone will have a patch
 

1023
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,230
that and maybe someone will have a patch
uh that

1024
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
uh that
 

1025
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,390
uh that
uh maybe solves whatever problem is in

1026
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
uh maybe solves whatever problem is in
 

1027
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,710
uh maybe solves whatever problem is in
there yeah yeah yeah oh yeah

1028
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
there yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
 

1029
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,390
there yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
that's the beauty of open source right

1030
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
that's the beauty of open source right
 

1031
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,070
that's the beauty of open source right
you know throw it out there and

1032
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
you know throw it out there and
 

1033
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,110
you know throw it out there and
and let people let people mess with it

1034
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
and let people let people mess with it
 

1035
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,230
and let people let people mess with it
i i i

1036
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
i i i
 

1037
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,470
i i i
because this particular application

1038
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
because this particular application
 

1039
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,630
because this particular application
deals with really sensitive data i don't

1040
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
deals with really sensitive data i don't
 

1041
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,630
deals with really sensitive data i don't
think i want to put it on github but

1042
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
think i want to put it on github but
 

1043
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,590
think i want to put it on github but
i'm going to use at least two other i'm

1044
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
i'm going to use at least two other i'm
 

1045
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,789
i'm going to use at least two other i'm
going to build at least two other

1046
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
going to build at least two other
 

1047
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,870
going to build at least two other
applications that do not

1048
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
applications that do not
 

1049
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,430
applications that do not
require you know that do not transmit

1050
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
require you know that do not transmit
 

1051
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,029
require you know that do not transmit
sensitive information

1052
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
sensitive information
 

1053
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,909
sensitive information
so um i will likely put those up on

1054
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
so um i will likely put those up on
 

1055
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,630
so um i will likely put those up on
github

1056
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
github
 

1057
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,510
github
but this is exactly how the free

1058
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
but this is exactly how the free
 

1059
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,230
but this is exactly how the free
software

1060
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
software
 

1061
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,270
software
the world started someone has a problem

1062
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
the world started someone has a problem
 

1063
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,070
the world started someone has a problem
i mean they

1064
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
i mean they
 

1065
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,590
i mean they
try to solve that problem and then they

1066
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
try to solve that problem and then they
 

1067
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,470
try to solve that problem and then they
put the code out somewhere

1068
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
put the code out somewhere
 

1069
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,230
put the code out somewhere
linus told us who made the kernel that

1070
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
linus told us who made the kernel that
 

1071
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,430
linus told us who made the kernel that
most people are using and he had

1072
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
most people are using and he had
 

1073
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,270
most people are using and he had
a problem he needed a unix system at

1074
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
a problem he needed a unix system at
 

1075
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,029
a problem he needed a unix system at
home so he made the world under the

1076
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
home so he made the world under the
 

1077
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,070
home so he made the world under the
colonel himself

1078
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
colonel himself
 

1079
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,350

1083
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,990
um i hope that he will have the
opportunity to come to norway

1084
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
opportunity to come to norway
 

1085
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,110
opportunity to come to norway

1099
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,350

right but he explicitly said that
 

1103
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,230
right but he explicitly said that
it would be big and professional

1104
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
it would be big and professional
 

1105
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,870
it would be big and professional
like the gnu so i always wanted to ask

1106
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
like the gnu so i always wanted to ask
 

1107

when will it be big and professional
 

1111
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,110
when will it be big and professional
personally like you well there didn't

1112
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
personally like you well there didn't
 

1113
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,870
personally like you well there didn't
now didn't canoe come about after linus

1114
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880

 

1115
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,909

84 really
yeah yeah because when he made the

1118
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
yeah yeah because when he made the
 

1119
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,070
yeah yeah because when he made the
kernel

1120
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
kernel
 

1121
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,669
kernel
all the other tools that he needed to

1122
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
all the other tools that he needed to
 

1123
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,430
all the other tools that he needed to
have a working system was already

1124
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
have a working system was already
 

1125
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,870
have a working system was already
made they only elected a colonel yes

1126
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
made they only elected a colonel yes
 

1127
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,909

okay oh nice and they have they had

1128
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
okay oh nice and they have they had
 

1129
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,110
okay oh nice and they have they had
started on a kernel

1130
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
started on a kernel
 

1131
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,390
started on a kernel
this is which is called heard that the

1132
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
this is which is called heard that the
 

1133
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,549
this is which is called heard that the
new herd and it's still not uh

1134
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
new herd and it's still not uh
 

1135
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,149
new herd and it's still not uh
uh ready for use yeah yeah yeah well

1136
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
uh ready for use yeah yeah yeah well
 

1137
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,070
uh ready for use yeah yeah yeah well
why not use one that's already available

1138
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
why not use one that's already available
 

1139
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,590
why not use one that's already available
right i mean that's the whole

1140
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
right i mean that's the whole
 

1141
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,590
right i mean that's the whole
that's the whole point isn't it yeah so

1142
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
that's the whole point isn't it yeah so
 

1143
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,669
that's the whole point isn't it yeah so
they'd remember that

1144
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
they'd remember that
 

1145
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,669
