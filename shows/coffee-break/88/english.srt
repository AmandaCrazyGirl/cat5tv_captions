so sobu give us a wave you just did but
 

21
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,109
so sobu give us a wave you just did but
that's okay yep

22
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
that's okay yep
 

23
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,269

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
thank you for the wave
 

27
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,589
thank you for the wave
and i'm bp9 hello so

28
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
and i'm bp9 hello so
 

29
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,709
and i'm bp9 hello so
let's see um not much going on in

30
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
let's see um not much going on in
 

31
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,830
let's see um not much going on in
in my world i um i have not made a lot

32
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
in my world i um i have not made a lot
 

33
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,590
in my world i um i have not made a lot
of progress on that client server

34
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
of progress on that client server
 

35
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,270
of progress on that client server
although

36
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
although
 

37
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,549
although
i think i reported last week that i

38
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
i think i reported last week that i
 

39
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,670
i think i reported last week that i
did make a successful connection between

40
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
did make a successful connection between
 

41
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,190
did make a successful connection between
the client and the server and made them

42
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
the client and the server and made them
 

43
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,389
the client and the server and made them
exchange

44
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
exchange
 

45
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,709
exchange
uh credentials back and forth uh you

46
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
uh credentials back and forth uh you
 

47
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,310
uh credentials back and forth uh you
know made them solve a problem back and

48
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
know made them solve a problem back and
 

49
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,510
know made them solve a problem back and
forth

50
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
forth
 

51
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,310
forth
and sobo i still agree with you sir i i

52
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
and sobo i still agree with you sir i i
 

53
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,990
and sobo i still agree with you sir i i
absolutely agree that those

54
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
absolutely agree that those
 

55
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,189
absolutely agree that those
encrypted packets should be signed um

56
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
encrypted packets should be signed um
 

57
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,109
encrypted packets should be signed um
and i do plan to implement that and try

58
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
and i do plan to implement that and try
 

59
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:05,910
and i do plan to implement that and try
and figure out

60
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
and figure out
 

61
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,469
and figure out
how to how to make that work reliable at

62
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
how to how to make that work reliable at
 

63
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,109
how to how to make that work reliable at
the moment

64
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
the moment
 

65
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,950
the moment
i cannot make that work reliably and i

66
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
i cannot make that work reliably and i
 

67
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,550
i cannot make that work reliably and i
don't know why so

68
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
don't know why so
 

69
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,109
don't know why so
i even used you suggested i go talk to

70
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
i even used you suggested i go talk to
 

71
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:15,990
i even used you suggested i go talk to
somebody

72
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
somebody
 

73
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,109
somebody
in chat or whoever who has used

74
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
in chat or whoever who has used
 

75
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,030
in chat or whoever who has used
this packet you know these packets

76
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
this packet you know these packets
 

77
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,550
this packet you know these packets
before this

78
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
before this
 

79
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,310
before this
crypto library before yeah um

80
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
crypto library before yeah um
 

81
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,510
crypto library before yeah um
and i used the uh test cases that are

82
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
and i used the uh test cases that are
 

83
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:29,990
and i used the uh test cases that are
actually

84
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
actually
 

85
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,630
actually
shipped in the source code with that

86
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
shipped in the source code with that
 

87
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,069
shipped in the source code with that
program

88
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
program
 

89
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,830
program
so uh with that library so hello peter

90
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
so uh with that library so hello peter
 

91
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,230
so uh with that library so hello peter
welcome peter

92
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240

 

93
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,230

i used the test cases that came with

94
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
i used the test cases that came with
 

95
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,590
i used the test cases that came with
that library and they

96
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
that library and they
 

97
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,670
that library and they
fail in the same way they usually work

98
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
fail in the same way they usually work
 

99
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,950
fail in the same way they usually work
but sometimes they don't but i have to

100
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
but sometimes they don't but i have to
 

101
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,990
but sometimes they don't but i have to
run the thing over

102
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
run the thing over
 

103
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,590
run the thing over
and over and over again to see that

104
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
and over and over again to see that
 

105
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,429
and over and over again to see that
failure you run it once

106
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
failure you run it once
 

107
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,709
failure you run it once
it's a good chance it'll work but if you

108
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
it's a good chance it'll work but if you
 

109
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,030
it's a good chance it'll work but if you
if you run the tests over and over and

110
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
if you run the tests over and over and
 

111
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,270
if you run the tests over and over and
over again

112
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
over again
 

113
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,749
over again
they sometimes work and sometimes they

114
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
they sometimes work and sometimes they
 

115
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,270
they sometimes work and sometimes they
don't i'm sorry i'm probably

116
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
don't i'm sorry i'm probably
 

117
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,350
don't i'm sorry i'm probably
having to do the probability curve on

having to do the probability curve on
 

119
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,309
having to do the probability curve on
the i need to say

120
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
the i need to say
 

121
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,470
the i need to say
uh take whatever the probability of them

122
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
uh take whatever the probability of them
 

123
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,150
uh take whatever the probability of them
they're failing

124
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
they're failing
 

125
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,309
they're failing
to give a mathematical idea what's going

126
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
to give a mathematical idea what's going
 

127
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,190
to give a mathematical idea what's going
on you know

128
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
on you know
 

129
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,670
on you know
it really just random or that as they're

130
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
it really just random or that as they're
 

131
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,350
it really just random or that as they're
fixed

fixed
 

133
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,030
fixed
i don't think it's random well

134
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
i don't think it's random well
 

135
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,229
i don't think it's random well
i don't know if it's random or not um

is that most times it works i want to

142
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
is that most times it works i want to
 

143
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,470
is that most times it works i want to
say probably 60 or 70 percent of the

144
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
say probably 60 or 70 percent of the
 

145
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,430
say probably 60 or 70 percent of the

147
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,270

yeah you know every time what the

148
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
yeah you know every time what the
 

149
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,350
yeah you know every time what the
percentage will work or would you

150
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
percentage will work or would you
 

151
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,630
percentage will work or would you
i want to say about 60 or 70 of the time

152
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
i want to say about 60 or 70 of the time
 

153
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,550
i want to say about 60 or 70 of the time
is is how how often signing works in

um but you know the rest of the time

158
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
um but you know the rest of the time
 

159
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,229
um but you know the rest of the time
it does not so when i figure that out

160
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
it does not so when i figure that out
 

161
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,910
it does not so when i figure that out
i will continue to figure it out but i

162
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
i will continue to figure it out but i
 

163
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,670
i will continue to figure it out but i
still have to write the um

164
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
still have to write the um
 

165
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,350
still have to write the um

okay so that's the keyboard okay

194
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
okay so that's the keyboard okay
 

195
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,869
okay so that's the keyboard okay
thinking

196
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
thinking
 

197
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,670
thinking
think white keyboard it is think outside

198
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
think white keyboard it is think outside
 

199
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,350
think white keyboard it is think outside
is the break outside keyboard

200
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
is the break outside keyboard
 

201
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,550
is the break outside keyboard
okay it's a bluetooth keyboard and i did

202
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
okay it's a bluetooth keyboard and i did
 

203
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,110
okay it's a bluetooth keyboard and i did
prove that it does work against the

204
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
prove that it does work against the
 

205
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,110
prove that it does work against the
raspberry pi with the raspberry pi

206
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
raspberry pi with the raspberry pi
 

207
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,550
raspberry pi with the raspberry pi
awesome so you pop open that

208
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
awesome so you pop open that
 

209
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,030
awesome so you pop open that
which is useless for a raspberry pi but

210
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
which is useless for a raspberry pi but
 

211
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,390
which is useless for a raspberry pi but
in a minute i'll show you what it's

212
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
in a minute i'll show you what it's
 

213
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,990
in a minute i'll show you what it's
really useful for

214
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
really useful for
 

215
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,830
really useful for
and then you open it like that

216
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
and then you open it like that
 

217
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,429
and then you open it like that
and that gets you a pretty much

218
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
and that gets you a pretty much
 

219
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,110
and that gets you a pretty much
well i won't say full size keyboard yeah

220
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
well i won't say full size keyboard yeah
 

221
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,110
well i won't say full size keyboard yeah
pretty darn close the spacing's pretty

222
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
pretty darn close the spacing's pretty
 

223
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,469
pretty darn close the spacing's pretty
good

224
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
good
 

225
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,110
good
it's it's awfully close to my to my

226
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
it's it's awfully close to my to my
 

227
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,110
it's it's awfully close to my to my
regular keyboard it may only be like 10

228
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
regular keyboard it may only be like 10
 

229
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,510
regular keyboard it may only be like 10
percent smaller

230
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
percent smaller
 

231
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,790
percent smaller
might be three quarters i don't think

232
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
might be three quarters i don't think
 

233
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,909
might be three quarters i don't think
it's that small

234
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
it's that small
 

235
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,469

have okay
 

243
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,550
have okay
to get to the numerics you have to hold

244
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
to get to the numerics you have to hold
 

245
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,990
to get to the numerics you have to hold
a function key down and use the new

246
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
a function key down and use the new
 

247
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,270
a function key down and use the new
merits along the top row

00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079

 

663
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,150

the configured servers that it is

664
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
the configured servers that it is
 

665
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,350
the configured servers that it is
looking for for

666
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
looking for for
 

667
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,150
looking for for
packages from so the problem there would

668
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
packages from so the problem there would
 

669
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,470
packages from so the problem there would
be

670
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480
be
 

671
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,949
be
finding packages that will work on this

672
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
finding packages that will work on this
 

673
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,990
finding packages that will work on this
distribution

674
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
distribution
 

675
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,110
distribution
and this cpu yeah um

676
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
and this cpu yeah um
 

677
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,310
and this cpu yeah um
i think yeah google is your friend in

678
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
i think yeah google is your friend in
 

679
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,350
i think yeah google is your friend in
this case

680
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
this case
 

681
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,629
this case
but i think that the

682
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
but i think that the
 

683
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,990
but i think that the
pine book not the pine book pro

684
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
pine book not the pine book pro
 

685
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,509
pine book not the pine book pro
but the pine book uses the same cpu

686
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
but the pine book uses the same cpu
 

687
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,230
but the pine book uses the same cpu
as this pine phone does and if that's

688
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
as this pine phone does and if that's
 

689
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,629
as this pine phone does and if that's
true

690
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
true
 

691
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,470
true
then theoretically i should be able to

692
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
then theoretically i should be able to
 

693
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,310
then theoretically i should be able to
use the same packages that are in the

694
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
use the same packages that are in the
 

695
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,990
use the same packages that are in the
pine book

696
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
pine book
 

697
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,629
pine book
in the pine phone theoretically we'll

698
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
in the pine phone theoretically we'll
 

699
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,230
in the pine phone theoretically we'll
see what happens

700
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
see what happens
 

701
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,150
see what happens
you watch me you watch me crash it big

702
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
you watch me you watch me crash it big
 

703
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,670
you watch me you watch me crash it big
time so

704
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
time so
 

705
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,990
time so
i better make sure i keep i make a copy

706
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
i better make sure i keep i make a copy
 

707
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
i better make sure i keep i make a copy
of a recovery image because apparently

708
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
of a recovery image because apparently
 

709
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,389
of a recovery image because apparently
if i

710
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
if i
 

711
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,389
if i
stick an sd card in there with a with a

712
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
stick an sd card in there with a with a
 

713
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,910
stick an sd card in there with a with a
bootable image

714
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
bootable image
 

715
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,269
bootable image
it'll boot off that instead of the

716
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
it'll boot off that instead of the
 

717
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,030
it'll boot off that instead of the

so what browser does the pine phone use

720
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
so what browser does the pine phone use
 

721
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,470

i'm going to try that probably this

792
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
i'm going to try that probably this
 

793
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,590
i'm going to try that probably this
afternoon i meant to try it yesterday

794

991
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,909
yes thank you good job i was about to
warn you about that

992
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
warn you about that
 

993
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,070
warn you about that
okay i could use some of your australian

994
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
okay i could use some of your australian
 

995
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,470
okay i could use some of your australian
words and nobody understand me

996
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
words and nobody understand me
 

997
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,549
words and nobody understand me
no no you're doing just fine nobody can

998
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
no no you're doing just fine nobody can
 

999
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,710
no no you're doing just fine nobody can
understand you now it's all good

1000
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
understand you now it's all good
 

1001
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,990
understand you now it's all good
and uh so so we hopefully try and get it

1002
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
and uh so so we hopefully try and get it
 

1003
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,310
and uh so so we hopefully try and get it
get it quite soon this week we hopefully

1004
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
get it quite soon this week we hopefully
 

1005
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,909
get it quite soon this week we hopefully
if we don't get any problems but the

1006
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
if we don't get any problems but the
 

1007
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,190
if we don't get any problems but the
problem is that uh

1008
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
problem is that uh
 

1009
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,990
problem is that uh
the board is quite got a lot of these on

1010
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
the board is quite got a lot of these on
 

1011
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,310
the board is quite got a lot of these on
and

1012
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
and
 

1013
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,710
and
uh got a lot of small connections

1014
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
uh got a lot of small connections
 

1015
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,549
uh got a lot of small connections
between them there was a thing

1016
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
between them there was a thing
 

1017
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,470
between them there was a thing
and they got a chance of the leads

1018
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
and they got a chance of the leads
 

1019
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,350
and they got a chance of the leads
coming off because of the legend

1020
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
coming off because of the legend
 

1021
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,789
coming off because of the legend
of experimenting with that we got him

1022
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
of experimenting with that we got him
 

1023
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,990
of experimenting with that we got him
well you probably want to uh yeah well

1024
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
well you probably want to uh yeah well
 

1025
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,190
well you probably want to uh yeah well
i thought if you were using rf um with

1026
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
i thought if you were using rf um with
 

1027
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,750
i thought if you were using rf um with
lots of

1028
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
lots of
 

1029
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,669
lots of
lots of amps and lots of watts you

1030
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
lots of amps and lots of watts you
 

1031
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,590
lots of amps and lots of watts you
probably want thicker wire than that but

1032
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
probably want thicker wire than that but
 

1033
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,590
probably want thicker wire than that but
i guess the control circuits don't need

1034
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
i guess the control circuits don't need
 

1035
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,669
i guess the control circuits don't need
such heavy gauge wire correct

1036
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
such heavy gauge wire correct
 

1037
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,950
such heavy gauge wire correct
only 150 milliamps per coil that's not

1038
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
only 150 milliamps per coil that's not
 

1039
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,430
only 150 milliamps per coil that's not
bad

1040
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
bad
 

1041
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,270
bad
okay yeah all right yeah not a problem

1042
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
okay yeah all right yeah not a problem
 

1043
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,310
okay yeah all right yeah not a problem
at all and uh

1044
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
at all and uh
 

1045
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,909
at all and uh
um um

1046
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
um um
 

1047
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,149
um um
a difficult i put the picture of it in

1048
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
a difficult i put the picture of it in
 

1049
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,029
a difficult i put the picture of it in
this called

1050
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
this called
 

1051
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,149
this called
i did yeah i saw you i saw that you

1052
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
i did yeah i saw you i saw that you
 

1053
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,070
i did yeah i saw you i saw that you
i it looked like a laser print was it or

1054
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
i it looked like a laser print was it or
 

1055
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,669
i it looked like a laser print was it or
an inkjet print

1056
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
an inkjet print
 

1057
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,710
an inkjet print
yeah it was a picture of a

1058
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
yeah it was a picture of a
 

1059
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,750
yeah it was a picture of a
of the um of the box that i painted at

1060
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
of the um of the box that i painted at
 

1061
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,070
of the um of the box that i painted at
the end i put the wire in it i think

1062
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
the end i put the wire in it i think
 

1063
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,830
the end i put the wire in it i think
that's why i left in

1064
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
that's why i left in
 

1065

that's why i left in
oh i thought you were talking about the

oh i thought you were talking about the
 

1067
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,870
oh i thought you were talking about the
circuit die the

1068
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
circuit die the
 

1069
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,190
circuit die the
printed circuit board that you were that

1070
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
printed circuit board that you were that
 

1071
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,870
printed circuit board that you were that
you printed no no no

1072
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
you printed no no no
 

1073
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,110
you printed no no no
okay uh i would have been to the dentist

1074
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
okay uh i would have been to the dentist

we gotta we gotta stop talking about the
 

1099
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,669
we gotta we gotta stop talking about the
pressing stuff we're gonna talk about

1100
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:31,679
pressing stuff we're gonna talk about
 

1101
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,350
pressing stuff we're gonna talk about
fun stuff instead

1102
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
fun stuff instead
 

1103
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,470
fun stuff instead
anyway they did they that they did okay

1104
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
anyway they did they that they did okay
 

1105
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,230
anyway they did they that they did okay
now and i told them they have to get out

1106
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
now and i told them they have to get out
 

1107
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,750
now and i told them they have to get out
because they pulled it up

1108
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:39,760
because they pulled it up
 

1109
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,750
because they pulled it up
they're the ones too much bugs

1110
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760

 

1111
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,310

and the other one on the other side has

1112
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
and the other one on the other side has
 

1113
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,149
and the other one on the other side has
started as well but uh

1114
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
started as well but uh
 

1115
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,190
started as well but uh
i'm trying to hold on to uh

1116
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
i'm trying to hold on to uh
 

1117
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,310
i'm trying to hold on to uh
i get uh same problem i got no doubt

1118
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
i get uh same problem i got no doubt
 

1119
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,750
i get uh same problem i got no doubt
about them i think they've got just the

1120
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
about them i think they've got just the
 

1121
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,149
about them i think they've got just the
roots and it's gone wrong again

1122
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
roots and it's gone wrong again
 

1123
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,190
roots and it's gone wrong again
so i just have to wait too and i'll go

1124
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
so i just have to wait too and i'll go
 

1125
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,470
so i just have to wait too and i'll go
get the injection

1126
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
get the injection
 

1127
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,390
get the injection
by the way talk about injections my

1128
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
