the initial setup of bitcoin was

168
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
the initial setup of bitcoin was
 

169
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,830
the initial setup of bitcoin was
that it was uh meant to buy a cup of

170
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
that it was uh meant to buy a cup of
 

171
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,470
that it was uh meant to buy a cup of
coffee

172
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
coffee
 

173
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,630
coffee
as you are drinking one right all right

174
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
as you are drinking one right all right
 

175
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,350
as you are drinking one right all right
so it is coffee break after all

176
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
so it is coffee break after all
 

177
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,630
so it is coffee break after all
yeah it's a as a monetary

178
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
yeah it's a as a monetary
 

179
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,070
yeah it's a as a monetary
uh value but that has changed

180
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
uh value but that has changed
 

181
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,270
uh value but that has changed
significantly so

182
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
significantly so
 

183
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,190
significantly so
bitcoin is exclusively now um

184
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
bitcoin is exclusively now um
 

185
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,350
bitcoin is exclusively now um
store value so nobody's using it to buy

186
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
store value so nobody's using it to buy
 

187
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,949
store value so nobody's using it to buy
something i mean you can buy a house for

188
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
something i mean you can buy a house for
 

189
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,990
something i mean you can buy a house for
example or

190
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
example or
 

191
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,670
example or
a car with bitcoin but nobody else

192
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
a car with bitcoin but nobody else
 

193
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,589
a car with bitcoin but nobody else
does use it on a day-to-day database

194
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
does use it on a day-to-day database
 

195
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,750
does use it on a day-to-day database
it's because of value yeah one bitcoin

196
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
it's because of value yeah one bitcoin
 

197
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,910
it's because of value yeah one bitcoin
is 32 000 us dollars

198
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
is 32 000 us dollars
 

199
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,789
is 32 000 us dollars
right and also every transaction on the

200
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
right and also every transaction on the
 

201
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,229
right and also every transaction on the
bitcoin blockchain

202
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
bitcoin blockchain
 

203
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,830
bitcoin blockchain
is around seven to twenty dollars so

204
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
is around seven to twenty dollars so
 

205
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,830
is around seven to twenty dollars so
a cup of coffee that costs two dollars

206
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
a cup of coffee that costs two dollars
 

207
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,509
a cup of coffee that costs two dollars
will cost you twenty two dollars because

208
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
will cost you twenty two dollars because
 

209
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:07,910
will cost you twenty two dollars because
of the

210
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
of the
 

211
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,550
of the
of the fees now having said that there

212
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
of the fees now having said that there
 

213
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,990
of the fees now having said that there
are two solutions

214
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
are two solutions
 

215
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,110
are two solutions
that run parallel one is to use a credit

216
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
that run parallel one is to use a credit
 

217
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,710
that run parallel one is to use a credit
card type of scenario so they're

218
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
card type of scenario so they're
 

219
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,990
card type of scenario so they're
companies

220
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
companies
 

221
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,069
companies
where you deposit the bitcoin and

222
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
where you deposit the bitcoin and
 

223
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,629
where you deposit the bitcoin and
they are still yours and you have got a

224
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
they are still yours and you have got a
 

225
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,430
they are still yours and you have got a
credit card

226
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
credit card
 

227
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,030
credit card
and you pay with a credit card and at

228
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
and you pay with a credit card and at
 

229
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,030
and you pay with a credit card and at
that moment they deduct then

230
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
that moment they deduct then
 

231
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,670
that moment they deduct then
the lower value uh so the two dollars

232
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
the lower value uh so the two dollars
 

233
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,150
the lower value uh so the two dollars
like

234
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
like
 

235
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,310
like
through the visa network from your

236
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
through the visa network from your
 

237
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,189
through the visa network from your
credit card

238
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
credit card
 

239
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,510
credit card
from your bitcoin account yeah so that's

240
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
from your bitcoin account yeah so that's
 

241
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,870
from your bitcoin account yeah so that's
one way how to use it

242
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
one way how to use it
 

243
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,030
one way how to use it
and the other one but the problem with

244
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
and the other one but the problem with
 

245
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,990
and the other one but the problem with
that is that you're

246
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
that is that you're
 

247
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,990
that is that you're
you're still relying on someone else to

248
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
you're still relying on someone else to
 

249
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,909
you're still relying on someone else to
actually transfer the funds

250
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
actually transfer the funds
 

251
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,870
actually transfer the funds
in this case yeah and the whole point is

252
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
in this case yeah and the whole point is
 

253
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,749
in this case yeah and the whole point is
that that wasn't

254
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
that that wasn't
 

255
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,870
that that wasn't
really the vision for bitcoin right

256
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
really the vision for bitcoin right
 

257
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,189
really the vision for bitcoin right
yeah but those those times have changed

258
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
yeah but those those times have changed
 

259
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,469
yeah but those those times have changed
so

260
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
so
 

261
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,390
so
it's now the old world mixing a little

262
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
it's now the old world mixing a little
 

263
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,909
it's now the old world mixing a little
bit with a new world

264
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
bit with a new world
 

265
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,749
bit with a new world
so this libertarian ideal of creating

266
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
so this libertarian ideal of creating
 

267
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,590
so this libertarian ideal of creating
a global currency that everybody can use

268
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
a global currency that everybody can use
 

269
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,350
a global currency that everybody can use
there are alternatives that are much

270
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
there are alternatives that are much
 

271
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,710
there are alternatives that are much
better than bitcoin

272
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
better than bitcoin
 

273
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,790
better than bitcoin
and also bitcoin created a so-called

274
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
and also bitcoin created a so-called
 

275
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,629
and also bitcoin created a so-called
second layer

276
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
second layer
 

277
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,990
second layer
that is a layer above

278
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
that is a layer above
 

279
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,070
that is a layer above
bitcoin which is called the lightning

280
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
bitcoin which is called the lightning
 

281
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,430
bitcoin which is called the lightning
network

282
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
network
 

283
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,430
network
which is currently still in development

284
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
which is currently still in development
 

285
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,990
which is currently still in development
but there you can use it and to buy

286
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
but there you can use it and to buy
 

287
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,390
but there you can use it and to buy
a cup of coffee so there is no problem

288
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
a cup of coffee so there is no problem
 

289
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,029
a cup of coffee so there is no problem
to use

290
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
to use
 

291
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,749
to use
the bitcoin to to buy a cup of coffee

292
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
the bitcoin to to buy a cup of coffee
 

293
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,270
the bitcoin to to buy a cup of coffee
through the lightning network

294
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
through the lightning network
 

295
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,870
through the lightning network
but then the vendor has to be and that

296
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
but then the vendor has to be and that
 

297
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,629
but then the vendor has to be and that
will happen yeah

298
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
will happen yeah
 

299
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,350
will happen yeah
so the fees there are then again 10

300
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
so the fees there are then again 10
 

301
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,629
so the fees there are then again 10
cents or even less than

302
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
cents or even less than
 

303
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,469
cents or even less than
that for a cup of coffee and it's

304
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
that for a cup of coffee and it's
 

305
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,070
that for a cup of coffee and it's
immediate yeah in the case of bitcoin

306
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
immediate yeah in the case of bitcoin
 

307
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,830
immediate yeah in the case of bitcoin
you have to wait 10 minutes

308
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
you have to wait 10 minutes
 

309
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,189
you have to wait 10 minutes
minimum to have a confirmation uh and

310
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
minimum to have a confirmation uh and
 

311
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,150
minimum to have a confirmation uh and
with a lightning network it's immediate

312
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
with a lightning network it's immediate
 

313
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,270
with a lightning network it's immediate
okay

314
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
okay
 

315
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,510
okay
what was the excuse me what was the

316
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
what was the excuse me what was the
 

317
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,990
what was the excuse me what was the
other scenario before i interrupted you

318
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
other scenario before i interrupted you
 

319
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,469
other scenario before i interrupted you
you mentioned one scenario yeah the

320
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
you mentioned one scenario yeah the
 

321
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,590
you mentioned one scenario yeah the
credit card

322
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
credit card
 

323
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,790
credit card
was okay okay so

324
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
was okay okay so
 

325
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,670
was okay okay so
so my experience with with bitcoin

326
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
so my experience with with bitcoin
 

327
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,390
so my experience with with bitcoin
wallets

328
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
wallets
 

329
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,230
wallets
is that they tend to

330
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
is that they tend to
 

331
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,990
is that they tend to
yeah the bitcoin wallet that i

332
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
yeah the bitcoin wallet that i
 

333
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,029
yeah the bitcoin wallet that i
downloaded many many years ago

334
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
downloaded many many years ago
 

335
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,110
downloaded many many years ago
downloaded like 40 gigabytes of

336
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
downloaded like 40 gigabytes of
 

337
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,309
downloaded like 40 gigabytes of
blockchain data

338
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
blockchain data
 

339
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,950
blockchain data
in order to in order to make it work and

340
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
in order to in order to make it work and
 

341
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,350
in order to in order to make it work and
the whole idea was that the

342
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
the whole idea was that the
 

343
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,270
the whole idea was that the
um that the blockchain

344
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
um that the blockchain
 

345
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,670
um that the blockchain
every node was supposed to verify the

346
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
every node was supposed to verify the
 

347
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,029
every node was supposed to verify the
blockchain

348
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
blockchain
 

349
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,870
blockchain
um i'm i'm i'm guessing that's also

350
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
um i'm i'm i'm guessing that's also
 

351
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,550
um i'm i'm i'm guessing that's also
changed quite a bit as well yeah i would

352
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
changed quite a bit as well yeah i would
 

353
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,350
changed quite a bit as well yeah i would
yeah that's true i mean if you're true

354
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
yeah that's true i mean if you're true
 

355
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,230
yeah that's true i mean if you're true
bitcoiner

356
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
bitcoiner
 

357
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,870
bitcoiner
then you have got your full node uh with

358
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
then you have got your full node uh with
 

359
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,350
then you have got your full node uh with
you

360
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
you
 

361
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,150
you
and the wallet is on the full node but

362
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
and the wallet is on the full node but
 

363
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,510
and the wallet is on the full node but
that has changed because people don't

364
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
that has changed because people don't
 

365
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,550
that has changed because people don't
want to wait

366
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
want to wait
 

367
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,909
want to wait
uh several hours until the they're

368
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
uh several hours until the they're
 

369
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,670
uh several hours until the they're
synced no so

370
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680

 

371
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,629

yeah so like you have got let's say

372
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
yeah so like you have got let's say
 

373
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,870
yeah so like you have got let's say
software wallet or hardware wallet

374
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
software wallet or hardware wallet
 

375
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,430
software wallet or hardware wallet
and then the vendor like let's say an

376
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
and then the vendor like let's say an
 

377
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,070
and then the vendor like let's say an
example

378
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
example
 

379
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,270
example
trezor is a vendor that that vendor then

380
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
trezor is a vendor that that vendor then
 

381
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,309
trezor is a vendor that that vendor then
has got the full node for you so you're

382
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
has got the full node for you so you're
 

383
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,830
has got the full node for you so you're
relying on them

384
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
relying on them
 

385
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,430
relying on them
which is okay because if they do

386
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
which is okay because if they do
 

387
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,350
which is okay because if they do
something wrong then

388
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
something wrong then
 

389
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,749
something wrong then
um they would be dead immediately

390
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
um they would be dead immediately
 

391
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,629
um they would be dead immediately
because nobody would

392
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
because nobody would
 

393
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,189
because nobody would
would use them anymore so but but that

394
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
would use them anymore so but but that
 

395
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,950
would use them anymore so but but that
you have to download and sync

396
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
you have to download and sync
 

397
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,950
you have to download and sync
with with bitcoin that's not the case

398
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
with with bitcoin that's not the case
 

399
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,150
with with bitcoin that's not the case
anymore

400
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
anymore
 

401
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,350
anymore
okay yeah you've got full nodes and then

402
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
okay yeah you've got full nodes and then
 

403
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,390
okay yeah you've got full nodes and then
uh small nodes and and sometimes you

404
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
uh small nodes and and sometimes you
 

405
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,070
uh small nodes and and sometimes you
don't even have that

406
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
don't even have that
 

407
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,150

the passcode for the private key there's
 

417
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,029
the passcode for the private key there's
no bitcoins in it so i'm not that

418
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
no bitcoins in it so i'm not that
 

419

landfill with uh
you know 50 bitcoins or something like

432
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
you know 50 bitcoins or something like
 

433
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,510
you know 50 bitcoins or something like
that yeah i think it was

434
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
that yeah i think it was
 

435
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,629
that yeah i think it was
several several uh

436
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
several several uh
 

437
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,070
several several uh
millions of bitcoins yeah 200 million

438
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
millions of bitcoins yeah 200 million
 

439
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,909
millions of bitcoins yeah 200 million
u.s dollars

440
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
u.s dollars
 

441
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:31,589
u.s dollars
wow that is nuts

442
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599

 

443
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,790

i cannot imagine that would be

444
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
i cannot imagine that would be
 

445
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,750
i cannot imagine that would be
but then again i mean the point is it's

446
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
but then again i mean the point is it's
 

447
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,469
but then again i mean the point is it's
currency

448
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
currency
 

449
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,829
currency
um well it's digital currency yeah

450
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
um well it's digital currency yeah
 

451
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,790
um well it's digital currency yeah
it's it's backed by more trust than i

452
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
it's it's backed by more trust than i
 

453
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,710
it's it's backed by more trust than i
think even the us dollar is at this

454
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
think even the us dollar is at this
 

455
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,670
think even the us dollar is at this
point right

456
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
point right
 

457
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,990
point right
absolutely that's one thing and it's

458
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
absolutely that's one thing and it's
 

459
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,790
absolutely that's one thing and it's
also

460
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
also
 

461
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,949
also
by far more secure than any other thing

462
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
by far more secure than any other thing
 

463
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,949
by far more secure than any other thing
that is out there

464
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
that is out there
 

465
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,590
that is out there
because of the of the blockchain and

466
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
because of the of the blockchain and
 

467
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,190
because of the of the blockchain and
would you say that is true of

468
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
would you say that is true of
 

469
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,550
would you say that is true of
of any cryptocurrency i mean no no no

470
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
of any cryptocurrency i mean no no no
 

471
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,590
of any cryptocurrency i mean no no no
if bitcoin if bitcoin was uh

running out like i was i was doing a

474
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
running out like i was i was doing a
 

475
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,870
running out like i was i was doing a
little bit of research before the um

476
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
little bit of research before the um

behind that one
 

833
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,389
behind that one
so theoretically that thing should be

834
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
so theoretically that thing should be
 

835
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,590
so theoretically that thing should be
zero

836
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
zero
 

837
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,670

bitcoin for example you've got the store
 

859
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,990
bitcoin for example you've got the store
value and

860
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
value and
 

861
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,990
value and
and the proof of work and and so there's

862
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
and the proof of work and and so there's
 

863
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,590
and the proof of work and and so there's
a big network behind it

864
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
a big network behind it
 

865
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,110
a big network behind it
if you've got ethereum you've got smart

866

if you've got ethereum you've got smart
 

867
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,629
if you've got ethereum you've got smart
contracts so you can do a lot of things

868

912
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
if that's all you wanted for then it's a
 

913
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,190
if that's all you wanted for then it's a
viable option yes

914
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
viable option yes
 

915
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,630
viable option yes
yeah yeah

916
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640

 

917
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,630

there are other options like tether for

918
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
there are other options like tether for
 

919
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,110
there are other options like tether for
example or so that are by

920
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
example or so that are by
 

921
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,070
example or so that are by
far better because the volatility i mean

922
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
far better because the volatility i mean
 

923
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,750
far better because the volatility i mean
if you look at the chart of

924
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
if you look at the chart of
 

925
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,789
if you look at the chart of
dogecoin it goes up in one day 300

926
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
dogecoin it goes up in one day 300
 

927
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,630
dogecoin it goes up in one day 300
percent next day it goes down

928
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
percent next day it goes down
 

929
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,990
percent next day it goes down
uh 50 again so it's crazy that's even

930
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
uh 50 again so it's crazy that's even
 

931
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,470
uh 50 again so it's crazy that's even
that's even true of bitcoin that's not

932
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
that's even true of bitcoin that's not
 

933
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,510
that's even true of bitcoin that's not
the reason

934
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520

 

935
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,510

no the volatility of bitcoin is a

936
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
no the volatility of bitcoin is a
 

937
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,549
no the volatility of bitcoin is a
complete different one

938
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559

 

939
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,750

but yeah just in one year thousand 500

940
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
but yeah just in one year thousand 500
 

941
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,430
but yeah just in one year thousand 500
percent or so those kind

942
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
percent or so those kind
 

943
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,750
percent or so those kind
because young people just do means and

944
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
because young people just do means and
 

945
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,590
because young people just do means and
say hey let's push this coin

946
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
say hey let's push this coin
 

947
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,789
say hey let's push this coin
let's get it to one dollar and it's

948
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
let's get it to one dollar and it's
 

949
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,070
let's get it to one dollar and it's
currently i think it's eight cents or so

950
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,080
currently i think it's eight cents or so
 

951
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,430
currently i think it's eight cents or so
[Laughter]

952
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
[Laughter]
 

953
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,430
[Laughter]
so bad luck if you bought it at a dollar

954
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
so bad luck if you bought it at a dollar
 

955
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,630
so bad luck if you bought it at a dollar
because uh

956
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
because uh
 

957
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,710
because uh
that'll be worth very little now yeah

958
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
that'll be worth very little now yeah
 

959
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,710
that'll be worth very little now yeah
what one can do um the uh uh

960
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
what one can do um the uh uh
 

961
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,350
what one can do um the uh uh
latest week's uh stories have uh taught

962
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
latest week's uh stories have uh taught
 

963
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,470
latest week's uh stories have uh taught
us that

964
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
us that
 

965
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,990
us that
what one can do is

966
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000

 

967
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,110

short the uh dodge coin

968
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
short the uh dodge coin
 

969
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,909
short the uh dodge coin
because if it has a one dollar and it

970
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
because if it has a one dollar and it
 

971
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,029
because if it has a one dollar and it
eventually will

972
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
eventually will
 

973
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,470
eventually will
go down then those who have uh

974
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
go down then those who have uh
 

975

um a very high task a very
 

1245
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,070
um a very high task a very
expensive task right and that will be

1246
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
expensive task right and that will be
 

1247
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,190
expensive task right and that will be
true even when

all the bitcoins run out um correct
and that's going to be reflected in

1252
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,080
and that's going to be reflected in
 

1253
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,510
and that's going to be reflected in
higher fees i'm sure

1254
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520

course
 

1259
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,230
course
and is that true for all

1260
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
and is that true for all
 

1261
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,710
and is that true for all
cryptocurrencies no no

1262
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
cryptocurrencies no no
 

1263
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,630
cryptocurrencies no no
no they are all working on a different

1264
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
no they are all working on a different
 

1265
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,950
no they are all working on a different
it's like comparing

1266
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
it's like comparing
 

1267
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,310
it's like comparing
transport yeah you've got a bus you've

1268
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
transport yeah you've got a bus you've
 

1269
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,390
transport yeah you've got a bus you've
got an airplane you've got a bus

1270
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
got an airplane you've got a bus
 

1271
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,789
got an airplane you've got a bus
so the currencies cryptocurrencies are

1272
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
so the currencies cryptocurrencies are
 

1273
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,830
so the currencies cryptocurrencies are
similar

1274
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
similar
 

1275
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,310
similar
and bitcoin will from my point of view

1276
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
and bitcoin will from my point of view
 

1277
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,870
and bitcoin will from my point of view
be

1278
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
be
 

1279
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,909
be
forever a star of value and

1280
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
forever a star of value and
 

1281
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,590
forever a star of value and
the second layer the lightning network

1282
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
the second layer the lightning network
 

1283
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,950
the second layer the lightning network
will be then the

1284
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
will be then the
 

1285
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,710
will be then the
the exchange part um and yeah i mean we

1286
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
the exchange part um and yeah i mean we
 

1287
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,470
the exchange part um and yeah i mean we
will all not be living anymore by

1288
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
will all not be living anymore by
 

1289
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,549
will all not be living anymore by
by that time when bitcoin really runs

1290
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
by that time when bitcoin really runs
 

1291
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,390
by that time when bitcoin really runs
out that's true

1292
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
out that's true
 

1293
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,190
out that's true
but but bitcoin has a finite supply i

1294
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
but but bitcoin has a finite supply i
 

1295
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,110
but but bitcoin has a finite supply i
think it's like 21 million coins or

1296
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
think it's like 21 million coins or
 

1297
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,669
think it's like 21 million coins or
something

1298
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
something
 

1299
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,909
something
yeah which can be subdivided into

1300
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
yeah which can be subdivided into
 

1301
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,470
yeah which can be subdivided into
millions and millions of satoshis

1302
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
millions and millions of satoshis
 

1303
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,470
millions and millions of satoshis
yeah i think it's one millionth of a

1304
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
yeah i think it's one millionth of a
 

1305
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,470
yeah i think it's one millionth of a
bitcoin it's a satoshi right

1306
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
bitcoin it's a satoshi right
 

1307
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,510
bitcoin it's a satoshi right
a hundred million 100 million okay yeah

1308
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
a hundred million 100 million okay yeah
 

1309
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,549
a hundred million 100 million okay yeah
even more than i expected um is that

1310
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
even more than i expected um is that
 

1311
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,269
even more than i expected um is that
that also

1312
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
that also
 

1313
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,590
that also
true that finite supply problem is that

1314
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
true that finite supply problem is that
 

1315
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,549
true that finite supply problem is that
also true

1316
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
also true
 

1317
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,990
also true
for other cryptocurrencies as well uh

1318
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
for other cryptocurrencies as well uh
 

1319
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,950
for other cryptocurrencies as well uh
no no ethereum is operating now

1320
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
no no ethereum is operating now
 

1321
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,710
no no ethereum is operating now
especially ethereum 2.0

1322
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
especially ethereum 2.0
 

1323
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,230
especially ethereum 2.0
will operate on a complete different

1324
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
will operate on a complete different
 

1325
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,070
will operate on a complete different
level so they

1326
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
level so they
 

1327
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,230
level so they
they have got a different system because

1328
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
they have got a different system because
 

1329
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,590
they have got a different system because
they're moving over from

1330
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
they're moving over from
 

1331
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,350
they're moving over from
proof of work which they're currently

1332
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
proof of work which they're currently
 

1333
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,830
proof of work which they're currently
using over the proof of stake

1334
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
using over the proof of stake
 

1335
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,789
using over the proof of stake
and so it will be different there yes

1336
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
and so it will be different there yes
 

1337
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,750
and so it will be different there yes
every currency

1338
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
every currency
 

1339
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,350
every currency
has got its own way of of uh

1340
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
has got its own way of of uh
 

1341
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,990
has got its own way of of uh
securing the network so with proof of

1342
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
securing the network so with proof of
 

1343
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,990
securing the network so with proof of
stake you have to prove that you have

1344
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
stake you have to prove that you have
 

1345
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,909
stake you have to prove that you have
the equivalent value

1346
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
the equivalent value
 

1347
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,630
the equivalent value
of the ethereum that you have somehow is

1348
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
of the ethereum that you have somehow is
 

1349
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,590
of the ethereum that you have somehow is
that true

1350
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
that true
 

1351
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,630
that true
yeah you're putting up money

1352
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
yeah you're putting up money
 

1353
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,549
yeah you're putting up money
to secure the network so there's an

1354
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
to secure the network so there's an
 

1355
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,990
to secure the network so there's an
algorithm it's done by through the

1356
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
algorithm it's done by through the
 

1357
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,549
algorithm it's done by through the
software

1358
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
software
 

1359
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,669
software
uh the ethereum software and that then

1360
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
uh the ethereum software and that then
 

1361
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,549
uh the ethereum software and that then
secures

1362
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
secures
 

1363
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,269
secures
with your ethereum the transaction and

1364
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
with your ethereum the transaction and
 

1365
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:49,909
with your ethereum the transaction and
if you're

1366
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
if you're
 

1367
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,190
if you're
you're a bad actor the you will lose

1368
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
you're a bad actor the you will lose
 

1369
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,590
you're a bad actor the you will lose
than

1370
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,600
than
 

1371
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,789
than
your the money that you put at stake

1372
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
your the money that you put at stake
 

1373
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,909
your the money that you put at stake
okay that's proof of stake

1374
00:25:59,909 --> 00:25:59,919
okay that's proof of stake
 

1375
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,269
okay that's proof of stake
interesting interesting my point was to

1376
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
interesting interesting my point was to
 

1377
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,149
interesting interesting my point was to
understand

1378
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
understand
 

1379
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,390
understand
and because i think it has to be said in

1380
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400
and because i think it has to be said in
 

1381
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,390
and because i think it has to be said in
this beta

1382
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
this beta
 

1383
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,870
this beta
about uh if people want to get into this

1384
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:10,880
about uh if people want to get into this
 

1385
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,029
about uh if people want to get into this
to learn uh or to invest

1386
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
to learn uh or to invest
 

1387
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,630
to learn uh or to invest
um uh there is on all the advice uh

1388
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
um uh there is on all the advice uh
 

1389
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,870
um uh there is on all the advice uh
i think it's over a hundred years old

1390
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
i think it's over a hundred years old
 

1391
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,830
i think it's over a hundred years old
advice that

1392
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
advice that
 

1393
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,789
advice that
and never put more money into it into

1394
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
and never put more money into it into
 

1395
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,110
and never put more money into it into
this

1396
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
this
 

1397
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,750
this
then you can afford to lose right yeah

1398
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:25,760
then you can afford to lose right yeah
 

1399
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,230
then you can afford to lose right yeah
yeah

1400

additional questions for robert i've got
i've got still one remark to the

1414
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
i've got still one remark to the
 

1415
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,149
i've got still one remark to the
investment side there

1416
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
investment side there
 

1417
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,470
investment side there
please go ahead robert go ahead because

1418
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
please go ahead robert go ahead because
 

1419
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,669
please go ahead robert go ahead because
the difference i mean

1420
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
the difference i mean
 

1421
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,909
the difference i mean
what i see with people that have not

1422
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
what i see with people that have not
 

1423
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,789
what i see with people that have not
been

1424
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799
been
 

1425
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,269
been
involved in cryptocurrencies and they

1426
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
involved in cryptocurrencies and they
 

1427
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:51,990
involved in cryptocurrencies and they
want to invest

1428
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
want to invest
 

1429
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,070
want to invest
something they come with the old mindset

1430
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
something they come with the old mindset
 

1431
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,070
something they come with the old mindset
of shares

1432
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
of shares
 

1433
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,950
of shares
that is absolutely not valid anymore so

1434
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
that is absolutely not valid anymore so
 

1435
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,390
that is absolutely not valid anymore so
if you're coming

1436
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
if you're coming
 

1437
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,350
if you're coming
with that mindset you will have a root

1438
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
with that mindset you will have a root
 

1439
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,789
with that mindset you will have a root
awakening at some time

1440
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
awakening at some time
 

1441
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,110
awakening at some time
and why if you do your research on a

1442
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
and why if you do your research on a
 

1443
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,190
and why if you do your research on a
currency i'd say if you go to something

1444
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
currency i'd say if you go to something
 

1445
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,870
currency i'd say if you go to something
like coin gecko and do some research

1446
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
like coin gecko and do some research
 

1447
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,310
like coin gecko and do some research
there

1448
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
there
 

1449
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,590
there
then first thing is the the network

1450
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
then first thing is the the network
 

1451
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,630
then first thing is the the network
is extremely important yeah because

1452
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,640
is extremely important yeah because
 

1453
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,310
is extremely important yeah because
in the case of bitcoin it's easy but if

1454
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
in the case of bitcoin it's easy but if
 

1455
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,830
in the case of bitcoin it's easy but if
you go to a currency

1456
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
you go to a currency
 

1457
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,149
you go to a currency
that is unknown uh or smaller like let's

1458
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
that is unknown uh or smaller like let's
 

1459
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,510
that is unknown uh or smaller like let's
say rook or

1460
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,520
say rook or
 

1461
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,389
say rook or
or mahada or whatever then you have got

1462
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:28,399
or mahada or whatever then you have got
 

1463
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,750
or mahada or whatever then you have got
a complete different network

1464
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
a complete different network
 

1465
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,430
a complete different network
and if nobody's pushing that network

1466
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
and if nobody's pushing that network
 

1467
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,870
and if nobody's pushing that network
there's nobody behind it

1468
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
there's nobody behind it
 

1469
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,510
there's nobody behind it
that thing will not go up in value so

1470
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
that thing will not go up in value so
 

1471
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,909
that thing will not go up in value so
the research is a complete different one

1472
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
the research is a complete different one
 

1473
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,070
the research is a complete different one
yeah you have to you have to compare it

1474
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
yeah you have to you have to compare it
 

1475
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,590
yeah you have to you have to compare it
with a gme

1476
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:41,600
with a gme
 

1477
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,430
with a gme

1478
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
uh with the game game
 

1479
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,230
uh with the game game
called game shop what happened last week

1480
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
called game shop what happened last week
 

1481
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,350
called game shop what happened last week
that's exactly how

1482
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
that's exactly how
 

1483
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,909
that's exactly how
how cryptocurrencies are being pushed

1484
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:51,919
how cryptocurrencies are being pushed
 

1485
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:52,389
how cryptocurrencies are being pushed
and

1486
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
and
 

1487
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,029
and
and uh and that's how you have to do

1488
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
and uh and that's how you have to do
 

1489
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,510
and uh and that's how you have to do
your

1490
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,520
your
 

1491
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,590
your
research so it's looking into the

1492
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
research so it's looking into the
 

1493
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,590
research so it's looking into the
currency that has got a great developer

1494
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
currency that has got a great developer
 

1495
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,389
currency that has got a great developer
team

1496
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
team
 

1497
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,710
team
management is not that important it's

1498
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
management is not that important it's
 

1499
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,830
management is not that important it's
the developers

1500
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
the developers
 

1501
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,590
the developers
and the marketing side so if they have

1502
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
and the marketing side so if they have
 

1503
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,110
and the marketing side so if they have
got really good developers that are

1504
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
got really good developers that are
 

1505
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,230
got really good developers that are
active

1506
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
active
 

1507
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,870
active
because very many times these projects

1508
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
because very many times these projects
 

1509
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,830
because very many times these projects
are open source

1510
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840
are open source
 

1511
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,750
are open source
so you can check what they're doing and

1512
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
so you can check what they're doing and
 

1513
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,430
so you can check what they're doing and
if you see that that network it's all on

1514
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
if you see that that network it's all on
 

1515
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,310
if you see that that network it's all on
github if

1516
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
github if
 

1517
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,470
github if
you can check that they're really active

1518
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
you can check that they're really active
 

1519
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,830
you can check that they're really active
in doing something

1520
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
in doing something
 

1521
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,430
in doing something
then um then that's a big plus sign

1522
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
then um then that's a big plus sign
 

1523
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,310
then um then that's a big plus sign
the network has to be big and also the

1524
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
the network has to be big and also the
 

1525
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,990
the network has to be big and also the
idea has to be a big one but

1526
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
idea has to be a big one but
 

1527
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,590
idea has to be a big one but
if the idea is not big you will not find

1528
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600
if the idea is not big you will not find
 

1529
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,750
if the idea is not big you will not find
many developers supporting that

1530
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
many developers supporting that
 

1531
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,789
many developers supporting that
that card anyway and it's true

1532
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
that card anyway and it's true
 

1533
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,950
that card anyway and it's true
also that that network has to be

1534
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
also that that network has to be
 

1535
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,830
also that that network has to be
supported by developers not only now

1536
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
supported by developers not only now
 

1537
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,190
supported by developers not only now
but also in the future as as as we move

1538
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
but also in the future as as as we move
 

1539
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,710
but also in the future as as as we move
forward because

1540
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:44,720
forward because
 

1541
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,269
forward because
uh yeah but if they lose interest in the

1542
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
uh yeah but if they lose interest in the
 

1543
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,389
uh yeah but if they lose interest in the
project

1544
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
project
 

1545
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,350
project
yeah they're stale now you have got the

1546
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,360
yeah they're stale now you have got the
 

1547
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,149
yeah they're stale now you have got the
market

1548
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
market
 

1549
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,110
market
that dictates that because now we're

1550
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
that dictates that because now we're
 

1551
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,710
that dictates that because now we're
coming into a bull market or we are

1552
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
coming into a bull market or we are
 

1553
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,549
coming into a bull market or we are
already in a bull market

1554
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
already in a bull market
 

1555
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,669
already in a bull market
and i've seen that now in 2018 and 19

1556
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
and i've seen that now in 2018 and 19
 

1557
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,669
and i've seen that now in 2018 and 19
where we had a bear market

1558
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
where we had a bear market
 

1559
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,830
where we had a bear market
then a lot of people will lose interest

1560
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
then a lot of people will lose interest
 

1561
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,269
then a lot of people will lose interest
and those things will go down

1562
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
and those things will go down
 

1563
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,909
and those things will go down
i mean all other coins bitcoin went down

1564
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
i mean all other coins bitcoin went down
 

1565
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,990
i mean all other coins bitcoin went down
by 80 85 percent and other grants that

1566
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
by 80 85 percent and other grants that
 

1567
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,430
by 80 85 percent and other grants that
cardano went over 90

1568
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
cardano went over 90
 

1569
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,789
cardano went over 90
95 down from the the cardano was once at

1570
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
95 down from the the cardano was once at
 

1571
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,149
95 down from the the cardano was once at
1.30

1572
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
1.30
 

1573
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,070
1.30
and it went down to 5 cents and so

1574
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
and it went down to 5 cents and so
 

1575
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,310
and it went down to 5 cents and so
so that is important from the investment

1576
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,320
so that is important from the investment
 

1577
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,990
so that is important from the investment
point of view yeah so the time

1578
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
point of view yeah so the time
 

1579
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,789
point of view yeah so the time
is good to get into cryptos now again no

1580
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
is good to get into cryptos now again no
 

1581
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,310
is good to get into cryptos now again no
financial advice

1582
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,320
financial advice
 

1583

but the time is good but you have to
 

1585
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,389
but the time is good but you have to
know when to exit this thing

1586
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
know when to exit this thing
 

1587
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,350
know when to exit this thing
and so from the investment point of view

1588
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
and so from the investment point of view
 

1589
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,950
and so from the investment point of view
not from the cryptocurrency for just

1590
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
not from the cryptocurrency for just
 

1591
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,149
not from the cryptocurrency for just
from the investment point of view you

1592
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
from the investment point of view you
 

1593
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,430
from the investment point of view you
need to

1594
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
need to
 

1595
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,110
need to
not be greedy if you're greedy you will

1596
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
not be greedy if you're greedy you will
 

1597
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,950
not be greedy if you're greedy you will
lose it you will never time the market

1598
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
lose it you will never time the market
 

1599
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,070
lose it you will never time the market
correctly anyway so on the way up you

1600
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
correctly anyway so on the way up you
 

1601
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,990
correctly anyway so on the way up you
have to take profits

1602
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
have to take profits
 

1603
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,310
have to take profits
constantly and on the way down you have

1604
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
constantly and on the way down you have
 

1605
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,789
constantly and on the way down you have
to also take profits because you never

1606
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
to also take profits because you never
 

1607
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,789
to also take profits because you never
know because these things can fluctuate

1608
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:56,799
know because these things can fluctuate
 

1609
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,149
know because these things can fluctuate
20 in one day or in a few days

1610
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
20 in one day or in a few days
 

1611
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,830
20 in one day or in a few days
so you don't know if this is a it's a

1612
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
so you don't know if this is a it's a
 

1613
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,510
so you don't know if this is a it's a
bubble that burst or if it's a bear

1614
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
bubble that burst or if it's a bear
 

1615
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,750
bubble that burst or if it's a bear
market or it's still bull market

1616
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
market or it's still bull market
 

1617
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,230
market or it's still bull market
yeah so always take profits very

1618
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
yeah so always take profits very
 

1619
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,269
yeah so always take profits very
important

important
 

1621
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,149
important
okay and then and you can't basically
