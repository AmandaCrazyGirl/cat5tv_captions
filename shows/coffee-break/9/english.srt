00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,000
do that I can do that so Robbie what I
 

315
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,670
do that I can do that so Robbie what I
learned was that be the way you load a

316
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:04,680
learned was that be the way you load a
 

317
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,340
learned was that be the way you load a
program into the point time it's very

318
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,350
program into the point time it's very
 

319
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,200
program into the point time it's very
similar to the Android to the Arduino

320
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,210
similar to the Android to the Arduino
 

321
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,350
similar to the Android to the Arduino
have you had a new experience with you

322
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
have you had a new experience with you
 

323
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,660
have you had a new experience with you
well there's two ways to do it as I as

324
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:20,670
well there's two ways to do it as I as
 

325
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,890
well there's two ways to do it as I as
apparently you could you can what's

326
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:22,900
apparently you could you can what's
 

327
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,660
apparently you could you can what's
called bit bang the one of the ports and

328
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:27,670
called bit bang the one of the ports and
 

329
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,500
called bit bang the one of the ports and
I want to say GPIO but I'm not sure yeah

330
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:31,510
I want to say GPIO but I'm not sure yeah
 

331
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,680
I want to say GPIO but I'm not sure yeah
or I think there's a way you can do it

332
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:34,690
or I think there's a way you can do it
 

333
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,500
or I think there's a way you can do it
with I squared C somehow to program it

334
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,510
with I squared C somehow to program it
 

335
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,440
with I squared C somehow to program it
which might be a bit faster I'm not sure

336
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,450
which might be a bit faster I'm not sure
 

337
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,440
which might be a bit faster I'm not sure
but as I've got a Raspberry Pi they show

338
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,450
but as I've got a Raspberry Pi they show
 

339
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,060
but as I've got a Raspberry Pi they show
a hardware show that we can use the

340
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,070
a hardware show that we can use the
 

341
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,520
a hardware show that we can use the
Raspberry Pi and they show you the

342
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:47,530
Raspberry Pi and they show you the
 

343
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,660
Raspberry Pi and they show you the
wiring diagram to connect it up with the

344
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:50,670
wiring diagram to connect it up with the
 

345
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,140
wiring diagram to connect it up with the
to connect it up with the with the pine

346
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,150
to connect it up with the with the pine
 

347
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,220
to connect it up with the with the pine
cone time but the idea is that you build

348
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,230
cone time but the idea is that you build
 

349
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,220
cone time but the idea is that you build
an image and that image is what gets

350
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,230
an image and that image is what gets
 

351
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,050
an image and that image is what gets
transferred to the to the pine time

352
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,060
transferred to the to the pine time
 

353
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,880
transferred to the to the pine time
okay so ace yes sir it is okay

354
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:10,890
okay so ace yes sir it is okay
 

355
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,390
okay so ace yes sir it is okay
absolutely so it's it's it it does not

356
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,400
absolutely so it's it's it it does not
 

357
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,800
absolutely so it's it's it it does not
run Linux it is it is an embedded

358
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:18,810
run Linux it is it is an embedded
 

359
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,470
run Linux it is it is an embedded
processor basically much like as I say

360
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
processor basically much like as I say
 

361
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,900
processor basically much like as I say
the Arduino and we know you only get to

362
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:24,910
the Arduino and we know you only get to
 

363
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,100
the Arduino and we know you only get to
run one program so as I as I read it it

364
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,110
run one program so as I as I read it it
 

365
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,790
run one program so as I as I read it it
looks like you build one program slash

366
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
looks like you build one program slash
 

367
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,850
looks like you build one program slash
image a hex image right or a binary

368
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:35,860
image a hex image right or a binary
 

369
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,320
image a hex image right or a binary
image that's what you send to that's

370
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,330
image that's what you send to that's
 

371
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,330
image that's what you send to that's
what you send to the phone tone and

372
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,340
what you send to the phone tone and
 

373
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,360
what you send to the phone tone and
that's what it runs so whatever

374
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,370
that's what it runs so whatever
 

375
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,310
that's what it runs so whatever
functionality you want to integrate has

376
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:47,320
functionality you want to integrate has
 

377
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,510
functionality you want to integrate has
to be all in that one program I think

378
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:53,520

 

379
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,580

really reminds me that that sounds like

380
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,590
really reminds me that that sounds like
 

381
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,860
really reminds me that that sounds like
the like early days of like hacking I

382
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:01,870
the like early days of like hacking I
 

383
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,130
the like early days of like hacking I
had an old Casio watch the UK and a

384
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:05,140
had an old Casio watch the UK and a
 

385
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
had an old Casio watch the UK and a
similar

386
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,150
similar
 

387
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,420
similar
so you create the image and then flash

388
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,430
so you create the image and then flash
 

389
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,480
so you create the image and then flash
it onto the wrong yeah well what kind of

390
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,490
it onto the wrong yeah well what kind of
 

391
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,210
it onto the wrong yeah well what kind of
storage does the fine time man it has 64

392
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,220
storage does the fine time man it has 64
 

393
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,170
storage does the fine time man it has 64
K yeah okay so we are going back aways

394
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,180
K yeah okay so we are going back aways
 

395
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,410
K yeah okay so we are going back aways
saying the same as this right which I

396
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,420
saying the same as this right which I
 

397
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,720
saying the same as this right which I
showed you yesterday although this has

398
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:23,730
showed you yesterday although this has
 

399
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,700
showed you yesterday although this has
32 K of ROM whereas the plane time has

400
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:28,710
32 K of ROM whereas the plane time has
 

401
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:35,000
32 K of ROM whereas the plane time has
64 K of ROM which is the wait wait

402
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,010
64 K of ROM which is the wait wait
 

403
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,890
64 K of ROM which is the wait wait
that's the memory that's the memory for

404
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:36,900
that's the memory that's the memory for
 

405
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,829
that's the memory that's the memory for
programs I believe there's no relational

406
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
programs I believe there's no relational
 

407
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,480
programs I believe there's no relational
yes no there's an additional 512 K for

408
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,490
yes no there's an additional 512 K for
 

409
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,840
yes no there's an additional 512 K for
program storage like data and data yeah

410
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:47,850
program storage like data and data yeah
 

411
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,560
program storage like data and data yeah
okay but the OS that a like the the

412
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,570
okay but the OS that a like the the
 

413
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,280
okay but the OS that a like the the
actual edge that drives the thing has to

414
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,290
actual edge that drives the thing has to
 

415
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,030
actual edge that drives the thing has to
be inside 64 64 which I guess like it's

416
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
be inside 64 64 which I guess like it's
 

417
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,670
be inside 64 64 which I guess like it's
a watch right so yeah it's gonna have

418
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
a watch right so yeah it's gonna have
 

419
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,030
a watch right so yeah it's gonna have
clock face it may be a couple of apps

420
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
clock face it may be a couple of apps
 

421
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,700
clock face it may be a couple of apps
that's gonna be my first one actually th

422
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:07,710
that's gonna be my first one actually th
 

423
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,650
that's gonna be my first one actually th
to put a patient clock face on it I

424
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:09,660
to put a patient clock face on it I
 

425
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:19,000
to put a patient clock face on it I
don't love that's slower 20th century

426
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,010

 

427
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,610

that's the first step I'm gonna do and I

428
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:22,620
that's the first step I'm gonna do and I
 

429
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,949
that's the first step I'm gonna do and I
think if I understand this correctly

430
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
think if I understand this correctly
 

431
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,800
think if I understand this correctly
I mean zero there are ways to do this

432
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:27,810
I mean zero there are ways to do this
 

433
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,269
I mean zero there are ways to do this
fear bones so no you don't use our tos

434
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:32,279
fear bones so no you don't use our tos
 

435
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,290
fear bones so no you don't use our tos
or anything like that

436
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,300
or anything like that
 

437
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,230
or anything like that
you yet eventually start from C and you

438
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
you yet eventually start from C and you
 

439
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,790
you yet eventually start from C and you
build it just like you do in our do we

440
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:37,800
build it just like you do in our do we
 

441
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,340
build it just like you do in our do we
know now Bo you mentioned rust at any

442
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,350
know now Bo you mentioned rust at any
 

443
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,500
know now Bo you mentioned rust at any
times I don't know that I'm going to do

444
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:45,510
times I don't know that I'm going to do
 

445
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,880
times I don't know that I'm going to do
this in rust because I'm not familiar

446
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,890
this in rust because I'm not familiar
 

447
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,769
this in rust because I'm not familiar
with it I'm Way more familiar with C

448
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:48,779
with it I'm Way more familiar with C
 

449
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,199
with it I'm Way more familiar with C
than I am with rust so I will most

450
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:51,209
than I am with rust so I will most
 

451
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,150
than I am with rust so I will most
likely just write this thing in C and

452
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,160
likely just write this thing in C and
 

453
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,150
likely just write this thing in C and
just see what I can do with it no pun

454
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
just see what I can do with it no pun
 

455
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,060
just see what I can do with it no pun

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:08,700
because it's it's quite similar from
 

465
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,460
because it's it's quite similar from

what I've seen but I've never really
gotten into that type of programming

468
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:12,839
gotten into that type of programming
 

469
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,160
gotten into that type of programming
unfortunately I love to oh oh oh yeah

470
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,170
unfortunately I love to oh oh oh yeah
 

471
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,240
unfortunately I love to oh oh oh yeah
I've done lots of

472
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,250
I've done lots of
 

473
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,090
I've done lots of
what's up C and Java and and of course

474
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,100
what's up C and Java and and of course
 

475
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,730
what's up C and Java and and of course
COBOL which is what I'm doing now but

476
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:23,740
COBOL which is what I'm doing now but
 

477
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,700
COBOL which is what I'm doing now but
why it's interesting about like the

478
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:26,710
why it's interesting about like the
 

479
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,440
why it's interesting about like the
whole like everything that's going on

480
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,450
whole like everything that's going on
 

481
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,870
whole like everything that's going on
right now when it comes to single board

482
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
right now when it comes to single board
 

483
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,610
right now when it comes to single board
computers maker technology STEM

484
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:32,620
computers maker technology STEM
 

485
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,050
computers maker technology STEM
education yeah

486
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,060
education yeah
 

487
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,340
education yeah
nine-time now is it's like like gwg said

488
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,350
nine-time now is it's like like gwg said
 

489
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,590
nine-time now is it's like like gwg said
it's like this is so the technology is

490
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:40,600
it's like this is so the technology is
 

491
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,590
it's like this is so the technology is
so like when we were growing on leggins

492
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
so like when we were growing on leggins
 

493
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,330
so like when we were growing on leggins
it's like it's like it's been recycled

494
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:45,340
it's like it's like it's been recycled
 

495
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,030
it's like it's like it's been recycled
but it's better it's better but it's

496
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,040
but it's better it's better but it's
 

497
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,030
but it's better it's better but it's
come full circle so now because we had

498
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
come full circle so now because we had
 

499
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,390
come full circle so now because we had
an I would say maybe a 15-20 year gap

500
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,400
an I would say maybe a 15-20 year gap
 

501
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,780
an I would say maybe a 15-20 year gap
where there was no maker tech everything

502
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:57,790
where there was no maker tech everything
 

503
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,970
where there was no maker tech everything
was like what you see is what you get

504
00:13:59,970 --> 00:13:59,980
was like what you see is what you get
 

505
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,280
was like what you see is what you get
here's the interface we give you the

506
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,290
here's the interface we give you the
 

507
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,380
here's the interface we give you the
interface you don't mess with that

508
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,390
interface you don't mess with that
 

509
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,860
interface you don't mess with that
you know Windows Mac was an iOS and

510
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:07,870
you know Windows Mac was an iOS and
 

511
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,450
you know Windows Mac was an iOS and
everything else was like this is

512
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:09,460
everything else was like this is
 

513
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,490
everything else was like this is
presented to you as is and that's how

514
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:11,500
presented to you as is and that's how
 

515
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,620
presented to you as is and that's how
you use it but now it's going full

516
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:13,630
you use it but now it's going full
 

517
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,990
you use it but now it's going full
circle back to the when we were growing

518
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
circle back to the when we were growing
 

519
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,300
circle back to the when we were growing
up where it was like we get to design it

520
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,310
up where it was like we get to design it
 

521
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,250
up where it was like we get to design it
we get to figure out how it works and we

522
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:20,260
we get to figure out how it works and we
 

523
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,620
we get to figure out how it works and we
get to flash the the innards and make

524
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:22,630
get to flash the the innards and make
 

525
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,370
get to flash the the innards and make
the OS and do everything else

526
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:25,380
the OS and do everything else
 

527
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,770
the OS and do everything else
I showed you the model 100 that started

528
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:28,780
I showed you the model 100 that started
 

529
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,610
I showed you the model 100 that started
even that far back right because I also

530
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:32,620
even that far back right because I also
 

531
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,720
even that far back right because I also
have a que pro 2x a CPM machine which

532
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:36,730
have a que pro 2x a CPM machine which
 

533
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,980
have a que pro 2x a CPM machine which
still runs but you had a little more

534
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:40,990
still runs but you had a little more
 

535
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,960
still runs but you had a little more
flexibility in terms of what you could

536
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:42,970
flexibility in terms of what you could
 

537
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,680
flexibility in terms of what you could
do with with that machine you still had

538
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:46,690
do with with that machine you still had
 

539
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,440
do with with that machine you still had
the constraints of the CPM but if you

540
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,450
the constraints of the CPM but if you
 

541
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,150
the constraints of the CPM but if you
wanted to you could completely replace

542
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,160
wanted to you could completely replace
 

543
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,110
wanted to you could completely replace
the the OS you could even replace the

544
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
the the OS you could even replace the
 

545
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,329
the the OS you could even replace the
wrong if you wanted to but you're still

546
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:57,339
wrong if you wanted to but you're still
 

547
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:00,180
wrong if you wanted to but you're still
within the constraints of the hardware

548
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,190
within the constraints of the hardware
 

549
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,270
within the constraints of the hardware
yes that's given to you before then you

550
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,280
yes that's given to you before then you
 

551
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,190
yes that's given to you before then you
had I guess like the s 100 or something

552
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,200
had I guess like the s 100 or something
 

553
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,260
had I guess like the s 100 or something
like that that you literally had like

554
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,270
like that that you literally had like
 

555
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,750
like that that you literally had like
your compute board you had the black the

556
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
your compute board you had the black the
 

557
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,670
your compute board you had the black the
backbone and you literally plugged in

558
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
backbone and you literally plugged in
 

559
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,490
backbone and you literally plugged in
yeah compute boards just like you did

560
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:14,500
yeah compute boards just like you did
 

561
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,880
yeah compute boards just like you did
with the s100 way back wing yeah

562
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:17,890
with the s100 way back wing yeah
 

563
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,160
with the s100 way back wing yeah
oh my god I'm old I just feel like it's

564
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,170
oh my god I'm old I just feel like it's
 

565
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,020
oh my god I'm old I just feel like it's
exciting because like we we just had

566
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,030
exciting because like we we just had
 

567
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,630
exciting because like we we just had
such a time of people didn't people that

568
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:27,640
such a time of people didn't people that
 

569
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,090
such a time of people didn't people that
grew up in the 80's 90's didn't

570
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,100
grew up in the 80's 90's didn't
 

571
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,230
grew up in the 80's 90's didn't
necessarily 80s we still

572
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
necessarily 80s we still
 

573
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,030
necessarily 80s we still
that's a pretty good maker tech but

574
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,040
that's a pretty good maker tech but
 

575
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,220
that's a pretty good maker tech but
definitely 90s into the 2000s it feels

576
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,230
definitely 90s into the 2000s it feels
 

577
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,489
definitely 90s into the 2000s it feels
like they didn't understand the

578
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:39,499
like they didn't understand the
 

579
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:42,220
like they didn't understand the
technology itself like most of my

580
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,230
technology itself like most of my
 

581
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,439
technology itself like most of my
customers if you move the icons on their

582
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:44,449
customers if you move the icons on their
 

583
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:46,150
customers if you move the icons on their
desktop they they don't know how to

584
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
desktop they they don't know how to
 

585
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,829
desktop they they don't know how to
offer get they don't know how to open

586
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
offer get they don't know how to open
 

587
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,579
offer get they don't know how to open
the Internet yeah yeah yeah yeah because

588
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:51,589
the Internet yeah yeah yeah yeah because
 

589
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,829
the Internet yeah yeah yeah yeah because
it because it's it's it's presented to

590
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
it because it's it's it's presented to
 

591
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:05,259
it because it's it's it's presented to
them I guess I guess the audio doesn't

592
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:05,269
them I guess I guess the audio doesn't
 

593
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:12,819
them I guess I guess the audio doesn't
work oh no she dara when she does zoom

00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:12,829
work oh no she dara when she does zoom

video zoom meetings with work her phone

596
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,490
video zoom meetings with work her phone
 

597
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,879
video zoom meetings with work her phone
for some reason doesn't allow gallery

598
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:18,889
for some reason doesn't allow gallery
 

599
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:19,619
for some reason doesn't allow gallery
view

600
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:19,629
view
 

601
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:23,230
view
so yeah they speak they think the

602
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,240
so yeah they speak they think the
 

603
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,179
so yeah they speak they think the
picture switches all the time and I'm

604
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:25,189
picture switches all the time and I'm
 

605
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,460
picture switches all the time and I'm
like that's it the gallery view that's

606
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,470
like that's it the gallery view that's
 

607
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,799
like that's it the gallery view that's
exactly what I said yesterday when I was

608
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:29,809
exactly what I said yesterday when I was
 

609
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:30,999
exactly what I said yesterday when I was
at the studio because I didn't have a

610
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:31,009
at the studio because I didn't have a
 

611
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,369
at the studio because I didn't have a
computer bill because my phone does that

612
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:33,379
computer bill because my phone does that
 

613
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,169
computer bill because my phone does that
so I actually so today it's different

614
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:35,179
so I actually so today it's different
 

615
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,410
so I actually so today it's different
because I have it open on my computer -

616
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:37,420
because I have it open on my computer -
 

617
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,769
because I have it open on my computer -
yeah so that's how I'm able to do that

618
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:40,779
yeah so that's how I'm able to do that
 

619
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:45,129
yeah so that's how I'm able to do that
oh yeah but you do yeah that's right so
