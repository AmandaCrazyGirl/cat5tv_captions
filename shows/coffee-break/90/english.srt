267
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,710
yeah yeah sure unless it is mandated
by which there is a very little chance

268
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
by which there is a very little chance
 

269
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,029
by which there is a very little chance
of that

270
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
of that
 

271
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,430
of that
unless it is what mandated by our

272
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
unless it is what mandated by our
 

273

uh until that happens
 

277
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,510
uh until that happens
and it's a very low probability of that

278
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
and it's a very low probability of that
 

279
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,990

is the investment side which is at the

332
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
is the investment side which is at the
 

333
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,710
is the investment side which is at the
moment

334
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
moment
 

335
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,469
moment
really interesting because of of the

336
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
really interesting because of of the
 

337
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,309
really interesting because of of the
bull market that we have

338
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
bull market that we have
 

339
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,430
bull market that we have
but i understand your point of view but

340
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
but i understand your point of view but
 

341
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,270
but i understand your point of view but
what will come is the technology of

342
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
what will come is the technology of
 

343
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,230
what will come is the technology of
cryptocurrencies yes all the banks even

344
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
cryptocurrencies yes all the banks even
 

345
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,629
cryptocurrencies yes all the banks even
in europe all the banks are currently

346
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
in europe all the banks are currently
 

347
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,950
in europe all the banks are currently
investigating the technology of

348
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
investigating the technology of
 

349
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,869
investigating the technology of
cryptocurrencies and it will come

350
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
cryptocurrencies and it will come
 

351
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,390
cryptocurrencies and it will come
directly indirectly

352
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
directly indirectly
 

353
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,270
directly indirectly
and yeah of course you can wait uh until

354
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
and yeah of course you can wait uh until
 

355
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,629
and yeah of course you can wait uh until
something happens

356
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
something happens
 

357
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,230
something happens
but the more you're prepared and the

358
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
but the more you're prepared and the
 

359
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,150
but the more you're prepared and the
more you know about how this technology

360
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
more you know about how this technology
 

361
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,029
more you know about how this technology
works the easier it will be for you

362
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
works the easier it will be for you
 

363
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,710
works the easier it will be for you
so dipping your toes is definitely

364
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
so dipping your toes is definitely
 

365
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,550
so dipping your toes is definitely
recommended

366
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
recommended
 

367
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,469
recommended
i mean what is the private key what's

368
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
i mean what is the private key what's
 

369
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,830
i mean what is the private key what's
the public key

370
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
the public key
 

371
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,589
the public key
um how does the blockchain work all

372
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
um how does the blockchain work all
 

373
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,029
um how does the blockchain work all
those things i would just

374
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
those things i would just
 

375
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,670
those things i would just
take a look into that it doesn't mean

376
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
take a look into that it doesn't mean
 

377
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,950
take a look into that it doesn't mean
you have to invest

378
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960

 

379
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,430

how would you learn about blockchain

380
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
how would you learn about blockchain
 

381
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,629
how would you learn about blockchain
yeah

382
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
yeah
 

383
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,510
yeah
i know how it works but i'm not uh

384
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
i know how it works but i'm not uh
 

385
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,710
i know how it works but i'm not uh
getting into it uh

386
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
getting into it uh
 

387
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,829
getting into it uh
for for the uh for the uh plain and

388
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
for for the uh for the uh plain and
 

389
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,430
for for the uh for the uh plain and
simple isn't that

390
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
simple isn't that

you don't have to put money in just
 

405
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,230
you don't have to put money in just
learn how the technology works

406
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
learn how the technology works
 

407
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,710
learn how the technology works
yeah because it will come it's like the

408
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
yeah because it will come it's like the
 

409
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,430
yeah because it will come it's like the
internet

410
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
internet
 

411
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,829
internet
yeah it's like the internet and in 92 93

412
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
yeah it's like the internet and in 92 93
 

413
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,070
yeah it's like the internet and in 92 93
yeah you were also had the option of

414
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
yeah you were also had the option of
 

415
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,790
yeah you were also had the option of
getting involved in doing something

416
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
getting involved in doing something
 

417
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,550
getting involved in doing something
and maybe programming a website in html

418
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
and maybe programming a website in html
 

419
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,389
and maybe programming a website in html
but it's a technology that will change

420
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
but it's a technology that will change

blockchain just how much do you learn
 

427
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,509
blockchain just how much do you learn
about the blockchain when you uh

428
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
about the blockchain when you uh
 

429
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,750
about the blockchain when you uh
when you invest like that though no you

430
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
when you invest like that though no you
 

431
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,550
when you invest like that though no you
don't have to invest

432

don't have to invest
 

433
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,710
don't have to invest
you learn how to operate it yeah exactly

434

437
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,230
you don't have to invest a penny in
in cryptos logistic technology like for

438
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
in cryptos logistic technology like for
 

439
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,710
in cryptos logistic technology like for
example

440
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720

out
 

459
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,710
out
yeah but i think nbp and i wanted uh

460

that i can trade at any time at any
moment so

518
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
moment so
 

519
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,710
moment so
there is the change in mindset and so

520
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
there is the change in mindset and so
 

521
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,870
there is the change in mindset and so
that's where you have to learn

522
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
that's where you have to learn
 

523
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,829
that's where you have to learn
how to how to operate in that field and

524
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
how to how to operate in that field and
 

525
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,949
how to how to operate in that field and
it's very simple

526
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
it's very simple
 

527
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,670
it's very simple
basically you have to check who is

528
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
basically you have to check who is
 

529
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,550
basically you have to check who is
currently the

530
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
currently the
 

531
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,710
currently the
i mean and this is applicable only to

532
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
i mean and this is applicable only to
 

533
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,230
i mean and this is applicable only to
the current bull market

534
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
the current bull market
 

535
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,590
the current bull market
when the bear market comes it's a

536
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
when the bear market comes it's a
 

537
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,269
when the bear market comes it's a
different thing so the current bull

538
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
different thing so the current bull
 

539
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,630
different thing so the current bull
market you have to see

540
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
market you have to see
 

541
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,350
market you have to see
who is currently pushing uh what coin

542
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
who is currently pushing uh what coin
 

543
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,069
who is currently pushing uh what coin
you make a list

544
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
you make a list
 

545
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,310
you make a list
of those yeah because if nobody's

546
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
of those yeah because if nobody's
 

547
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,430
of those yeah because if nobody's
pushing uh

548
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
pushing uh
 

549
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,550
pushing uh
a coin if you find something like no not

550
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
a coin if you find something like no not
 

551
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,750
a coin if you find something like no not
giving any names

552
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
giving any names
 

553
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,670
giving any names
when you find a coin that you like and

554
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
when you find a coin that you like and
 

555
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,269
when you find a coin that you like and
nobody's pushing it it will not have an

556
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
nobody's pushing it it will not have an
 

557
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,150
nobody's pushing it it will not have an
effect on your

558
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
effect on your
 

559
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,829
effect on your
on the on the increment of of the price

560
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
on the on the increment of of the price
 

561
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,590
on the on the increment of of the price
so you have to check who is currently

562
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
so you have to check who is currently
 

563
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,870
so you have to check who is currently
pushing it then

564
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
pushing it then
 

565
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,110
pushing it then
what industry is it in yeah because not

566
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
what industry is it in yeah because not
 

567
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,470
what industry is it in yeah because not
every industry is currently

568
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
every industry is currently
 

569
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,750

programming

576
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
programming
 

577
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,190
programming
it's all done through one website so you

578
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
it's all done through one website so you
 

579
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,790
it's all done through one website so you
go to coingecko

580
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
go to coingecko
 

581
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,949
go to coingecko
you select those coins and you've got

582
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
you select those coins and you've got
 

583
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,310
you select those coins and you've got
all the information there so

584
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
all the information there so
 

585
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,710
all the information there so
it's much easier than the traditional

586
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
it's much easier than the traditional
 

587
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,750
it's much easier than the traditional

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,310
dollars
but that's the first step and then the

688
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
but that's the first step and then the
 

689
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,949
but that's the first step and then the
second step

690
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
second step
 

691
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,949
second step
is learning how this whole eco

692
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
is learning how this whole eco
 

693
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,710
is learning how this whole eco
environment works

694
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
environment works
 

695
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,350
environment works
yeah and then you need to get involved

696
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
yeah and then you need to get involved
 

697
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,030
yeah and then you need to get involved
into what the wallet is

698
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
into what the wallet is
 

699
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,550

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
have hardware software wallet
 

703
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,629
have hardware software wallet
that's for advanced get you a position

704
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
that's for advanced get you a position
 

705
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,430
that's for advanced get you a position
so

706
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
so
 

707
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,910
so
so those first those first steps though

708
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
so those first those first steps though
 

709
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,470
so those first those first steps though
when you

1362
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960

you have to learn to take profits when
 

1369
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,269

this thing goes up but also when it goes
down
