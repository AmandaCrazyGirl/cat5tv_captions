would like to focus more on development
so if you don't know anything about

88
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
so if you don't know anything about
 

89
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,940
so if you don't know anything about
programming don't worry about it this

90
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:55,950
programming don't worry about it this
 

91
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,109
programming don't worry about it this
this is your moment here and so what

92
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119
this is your moment here and so what
 

93
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,020
this is your moment here and so what
you'll see behind me there's a step by

94
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,030
you'll see behind me there's a step by
 

95
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,539
you'll see behind me there's a step by
step idea on how you can get into this

96
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:05,549
step idea on how you can get into this
 

97
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,150
step idea on how you can get into this
market how you can find a job in this

98
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
market how you can find a job in this
 

99
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,279
market how you can find a job in this
industry and so the first step if you

100
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:10,289
industry and so the first step if you
 

101
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,990
industry and so the first step if you
don't know anything about a programming

102
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
don't know anything about a programming
 

103
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
don't know anything about a programming
language is learn the program

104
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,450
language is learn the program
 

105
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,800
language is learn the program
language now it's not difficult within a

106
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:16,810
language now it's not difficult within a
 

107
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,900
language now it's not difficult within a
day you know the basics it's really easy

108
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:18,910
day you know the basics it's really easy
 

109
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,759
day you know the basics it's really easy
to do that it's all about logic if you

110
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:20,769
to do that it's all about logic if you
 

111
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,670
to do that it's all about logic if you
can't think in a logical way then

112
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
can't think in a logical way then
 

113
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,500
can't think in a logical way then
learning a programming language is

114
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,510
learning a programming language is
 

115
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,000
learning a programming language is
something very easy and I would start

116
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,010
something very easy and I would start
 

117
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,860
something very easy and I would start
with JavaScript and they're all by the

118
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:28,870
with JavaScript and they're all by the
 

119
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,509
with JavaScript and they're all by the
way very similar so there's no big

120
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:30,519
way very similar so there's no big
 

121
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,850
way very similar so there's no big
differences between one language and the

122
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:32,860
differences between one language and the
 

123
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,740
differences between one language and the
other I would start with JavaScript

124
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:34,750
other I would start with JavaScript
 

125
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,380
other I would start with JavaScript
because you can develop something that

126
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,390
because you can develop something that
 

127
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,210
because you can develop something that
is easily visible on a screen or so and

128
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,220
is easily visible on a screen or so and
 

129
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,080
is easily visible on a screen or so and
then if you know JavaScript I would go

130
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,090
then if you know JavaScript I would go
 

131
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,479
then if you know JavaScript I would go
over into Python because that's what a

132
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:48,489
over into Python because that's what a
 

133
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,680
over into Python because that's what a
lot of crypto companies or platforms are

134
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:52,690
lot of crypto companies or platforms are

one day once you've got that knowledge I
 

161
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,479
one day once you've got that knowledge I
would focus on blockchain so let's take
