tool that tells you a specific value at
 

195
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,480
tool that tells you a specific value at
a specific time for example the price of

196
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,490
a specific time for example the price of
 

197
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,659
a specific time for example the price of
Bitcoin as you know there are probably

198
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:48,669
Bitcoin as you know there are probably
 

199
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,200
Bitcoin as you know there are probably
over four hundred five hundred exchanges

200
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,210
over four hundred five hundred exchanges
 

201
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,200
over four hundred five hundred exchanges
that are trading in Bitcoin and they all

202
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,210
that are trading in Bitcoin and they all
 

203
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,820
that are trading in Bitcoin and they all
have a different price I mean it's a

204
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:56,830
have a different price I mean it's a
 

205
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,529
have a different price I mean it's a
minimal difference but what happens if

206
00:04:58,529 --> 00:04:58,539
minimal difference but what happens if
 

207
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,450
minimal difference but what happens if
there's a crash and the difference

208
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:00,460
there's a crash and the difference
 

209
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,920
there's a crash and the difference
between those exchanges will be

210
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:01,930
between those exchanges will be
 

211
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,860
between those exchanges will be
substantial and that is of importance

212
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:04,870
substantial and that is of importance
 

213
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,920
substantial and that is of importance
for for example these defy platforms

214
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:07,930
for for example these defy platforms
 

215
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,350
for for example these defy platforms
which price should they use if they have

216
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:10,360
which price should they use if they have
 

217
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,249
which price should they use if they have
to liquidate a position and for that

218
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:14,259
to liquidate a position and for that
 

219
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,350
to liquidate a position and for that
they're differently developing Oracle's

220
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,360
they're differently developing Oracle's
 

221
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,510
they're differently developing Oracle's
and coinbase just launched a price

222
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
and coinbase just launched a price
 

223
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,709
and coinbase just launched a price
Oracle and that will be life or it's

224
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:25,719
Oracle and that will be life or it's
 

225
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:31,350
Oracle and that will be life or it's
already life and next is the auto auto

226
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
already life and next is the auto auto
 

227
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,610
already life and next is the auto auto
foundation took a decision to change

228
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:34,620
foundation took a decision to change
 

229
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,689
foundation took a decision to change
smart contracts idea they initially had

230
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:39,699
smart contracts idea they initially had
 

231
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,510
smart contracts idea they initially had
that and the base layer and they chew

232
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,520
that and the base layer and they chew
 

233
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,219
that and the base layer and they chew
moving that now to layer to layer to

234
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:47,229
moving that now to layer to layer to
 

235
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,200
moving that now to layer to layer to
fund a solution so it's like the

236
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,210
fund a solution so it's like the
 

237
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,629
fund a solution so it's like the
Lightning Network to Bitcoin it's not

238
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:51,639
Lightning Network to Bitcoin it's not
 

239
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,629
Lightning Network to Bitcoin it's not
part of the base cryptocurrency it's a

240
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:57,639
part of the base cryptocurrency it's a
 

241
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,659
part of the base cryptocurrency it's a
level higher so that is a decision that

242
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:00,669
level higher so that is a decision that
 

243
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,670
level higher so that is a decision that
they took let's see if that comes

244
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:02,680
they took let's see if that comes
 

245
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,959
they took let's see if that comes
because it's not the first time that

246
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:03,969
because it's not the first time that
 

247
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:08,100
because it's not the first time that
they changed that and yeah that's that's

248
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,110
they changed that and yeah that's that's
 

249
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,850
they changed that and yeah that's that's
it for me so I wish you a great week
