00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,900

welcome back to the pretty corner of

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:05,910
welcome back to the pretty corner of
 

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,049
welcome back to the pretty corner of
your well today we'll only have two

6
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:09,059
your well today we'll only have two
 

7
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,879
your well today we'll only have two
headlines the first one will be having

8
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:10,889
headlines the first one will be having
 

9
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,190
headlines the first one will be having
and the second one will be decent

10
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
and the second one will be decent
 

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,289
and the second one will be decent
now the having occurs every two hundred

12
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:15,299
now the having occurs every two hundred
 

13
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,029
now the having occurs every two hundred
ten thousand blocks or roughly every

14
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
ten thousand blocks or roughly every
 

15
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,029
ten thousand blocks or roughly every
four years and reduces the block subsidy

16
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:20,039
four years and reduces the block subsidy
 

17
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,800
four years and reduces the block subsidy
so the money that the miners are getting

18
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:21,810
so the money that the miners are getting
 

19
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,070
so the money that the miners are getting
by around 50% currently that is twelve

20
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,080
by around 50% currently that is twelve
 

21
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,019
by around 50% currently that is twelve
and a half per second every ten minutes

22
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:27,029
and a half per second every ten minutes
 

23
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,380
and a half per second every ten minutes
and it will be reduced to six point two

24
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,390
and it will be reduced to six point two
 

25
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,799
and it will be reduced to six point two
five after around the 12th of May as you

26
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:33,809
five after around the 12th of May as you
 

27
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,709
five after around the 12th of May as you
can see behind me there is a clock the

28
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
can see behind me there is a clock the
 

29
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,220
can see behind me there is a clock the
upper time is based on the current block

30
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,230
upper time is based on the current block
 

31
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,740
upper time is based on the current block
time so it takes around eight point

32
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:42,750
time so it takes around eight point
 

33
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,810
time so it takes around eight point
eight minutes not 10 minutes to mine a

34
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:44,820
eight minutes not 10 minutes to mine a
 

35
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,549
eight minutes not 10 minutes to mine a
block and the reason is that everybody

36
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
block and the reason is that everybody
 

37
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,920
block and the reason is that everybody
that has got an a6 minor switched it

38
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:48,930
that has got an a6 minor switched it
 

39
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,869
that has got an a6 minor switched it
machine on to take advantage of the

40
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
machine on to take advantage of the
 

41
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,750
machine on to take advantage of the
current still 12 and a half Bitcoin that

42
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
current still 12 and a half Bitcoin that
 

43
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,290
current still 12 and a half Bitcoin that
the system emits every around 10 minutes

44
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:57,300
the system emits every around 10 minutes
 

45
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,459
the system emits every around 10 minutes
or currently every eight and a half

46
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:58,469
or currently every eight and a half
 

47
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,950
or currently every eight and a half
minutes so you have to watch the upper

48
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
minutes so you have to watch the upper
 

49
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,750
minutes so you have to watch the upper
time because that is the one that counts

50
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,760
time because that is the one that counts
 

51
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,770
time because that is the one that counts
there is no time within the Bitcoin

52
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:06,780
there is no time within the Bitcoin
 

53
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,140
there is no time within the Bitcoin
blockchain it's just block and every

54
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,150
blockchain it's just block and every
 

55
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,870
blockchain it's just block and every
look I said takes around ten minutes to

56
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:11,880
look I said takes around ten minutes to
 

57
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,230
look I said takes around ten minutes to
be mined and so there's this time

58
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,240
be mined and so there's this time
 

59
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,789
be mined and so there's this time
difference coming from now how do you

60
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
difference coming from now how do you
 

61
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,320
difference coming from now how do you
say it correctly is it having or

62
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,330
say it correctly is it having or
 

63
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,899
say it correctly is it having or
happening I was asked well you can use

64
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:23,909
happening I was asked well you can use
 

65
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,800
happening I was asked well you can use
both in the in the blockchain itself in

66
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:27,810
both in the in the blockchain itself in
 

67
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,020
both in the in the blockchain itself in
the code it says having it's hardwired

68
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,030
the code it says having it's hardwired
 

69
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,179
the code it says having it's hardwired
and they're hard-coded in there and if

70
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:32,189
and they're hard-coded in there and if
 

71
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,920
and they're hard-coded in there and if
you want to take a look into that also

72
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:33,930
you want to take a look into that also
 

73
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,289
you want to take a look into that also
the 210,000 blocks is hard-coded in

side directory SCR and there you search
 

81
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,819
side directory SCR and there you search
for a file called validate dot cpp in

search for having and you'll find it
 

87
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,569
search for having and you'll find it
there and you'll find also the formula

88
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:02,579
there and you'll find also the formula
 

89
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,280
there and you'll find also the formula
and there and the other one with the two

and the
 

97
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,590
and the
question is okay what happens after the

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:14,600
question is okay what happens after the
 

99
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,900
question is okay what happens after the
let's say that's to 12th of May 11 for

100
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:17,910
let's say that's to 12th of May 11 for
 

101
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,510
let's say that's to 12th of May 11 for
me whenever that having happens will the

102
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,520
me whenever that having happens will the
 

103
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,170
me whenever that having happens will the
Bitcoin system crash no it won't because

104
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,180
Bitcoin system crash no it won't because
 

105
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,370
Bitcoin system crash no it won't because
it's not the first time it's not the

106
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:25,380
it's not the first time it's not the
 

107
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,070
it's not the first time it's not the
third time that this happens and and the

108
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
third time that this happens and and the
 

109
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,110
third time that this happens and and the
miners that have got old machines are

110
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
miners that have got old machines are
 

111
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,020
miners that have got old machines are
not operating economically anymore we'll

112
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,030
not operating economically anymore we'll
 

113
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,460
not operating economically anymore we'll
just switch off their machines or we'll

114
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,470
just switch off their machines or we'll
 

115
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,800
just switch off their machines or we'll
move to another network the plenty of

116
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:39,810
move to another network the plenty of
 

117
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,200
move to another network the plenty of
our networks that accept or that that

118
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,210
our networks that accept or that that
 

119
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,170
our networks that accept or that that
can work with ASIC machines so only the

120
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,180
can work with ASIC machines so only the
 

121
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,330
can work with ASIC machines so only the
best machines will continue working on

122
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,340
best machines will continue working on
 

123
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,950
best machines will continue working on
the Bitcoin blockchain that has always

124
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:48,960
the Bitcoin blockchain that has always
 

125
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,400
the Bitcoin blockchain that has always
been like that just to remind you back

126
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,410
been like that just to remind you back
 

127
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,860
been like that just to remind you back
in 2013 when somebody came up with the

128
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:54,870
in 2013 when somebody came up with the
 

129
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,010
in 2013 when somebody came up with the
ASIC for the first time all those GPS

130
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,020
ASIC for the first time all those GPS
 

131
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,910
ASIC for the first time all those GPS
miners GPU - sorry the GPO - were

132
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
miners GPU - sorry the GPO - were
 

133
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,560
miners GPU - sorry the GPO - were
obsolete and could be switched off

134
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,570
obsolete and could be switched off
 

135
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,050
obsolete and could be switched off
because none of them were really mining

136
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,060
because none of them were really mining
 

137
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,830
because none of them were really mining
any bitcoins anymore so it life will

138
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
any bitcoins anymore so it life will
 

139
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,980
any bitcoins anymore so it life will
continue and also if let's say a

140
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:12,990
continue and also if let's say a
 

141
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,050
continue and also if let's say a
substantial amount of Bitcoin or switch

142
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,060
substantial amount of Bitcoin or switch
 

143
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,960
substantial amount of Bitcoin or switch
off the machines then as it's currently

144
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:17,970
off the machines then as it's currently
 

145
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,240
off the machines then as it's currently
happening with the time the time will be

146
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,250
happening with the time the time will be
 

147
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,070
happening with the time the time will be
inverted so it will take longer than 10

148
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
inverted so it will take longer than 10
 

149
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,210
inverted so it will take longer than 10
minutes to mine a Bitcoin and to mine a

150
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,220
minutes to mine a Bitcoin and to mine a
 

151
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,060
minutes to mine a Bitcoin and to mine a
block and and after 2016 blocks the

152
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,070
block and and after 2016 blocks the
 

153
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,370
block and and after 2016 blocks the
difficulty will be just it anyway and it

154
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:34,380
difficulty will be just it anyway and it
 

155
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,140
difficulty will be just it anyway and it
will be back to the usual ten minutes so

156
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,150
will be back to the usual ten minutes so
 

157
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,700
will be back to the usual ten minutes so
there's nothing to worry about this is a

158
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:37,710
there's nothing to worry about this is a
 

159

blockchain on the Bitcoin blockchain and
 

163
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,520

that's happening because it will reduce
 

173
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,000
that's happening because it will reduce
the subsidy or the inflation rate from

D SEP and it's translated into digital

184
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
D SEP and it's translated into digital
 

185
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,810
D SEP and it's translated into digital
currency electronic payment and that is

currency electronic payment and that is
 

187
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,110

237
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,159
where they're rolling it out and testing
it they will be involving huge vendors

against that because it's not paper
anymore you cannot just go somewhere and

anymore you cannot just go somewhere and
