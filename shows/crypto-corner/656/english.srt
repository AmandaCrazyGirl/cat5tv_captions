Bitcoin an increase of 2.4% in last 7

20
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
Bitcoin an increase of 2.4% in last 7
 

21
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,640
Bitcoin an increase of 2.4% in last 7
days but if we sort this year by 7 days

22
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:31,650
days but if we sort this year by 7 days
 

23
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,209
days but if we sort this year by 7 days
we see suddenly compound increasing by

24
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:35,219
we see suddenly compound increasing by
 

25
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,810
we see suddenly compound increasing by
292 percent the over 20 coins that had

26
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:38,820
292 percent the over 20 coins that had
 

27
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,930
292 percent the over 20 coins that had
an increase of over 15% and on the

28
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:41,940
an increase of over 15% and on the
 

29
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,720
an increase of over 15% and on the
downside only two coins lost more than

30
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:44,730
downside only two coins lost more than
 

31
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,170
downside only two coins lost more than
15% so what happened here why is there

32
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,180
15% so what happened here why is there
 

33
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,049
15% so what happened here why is there
suddenly such a big change and if we

34
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,059
suddenly such a big change and if we
 

35
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,910
suddenly such a big change and if we
look into the d-file market cap because

36
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:52,920
look into the d-file market cap because
 

37
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,000
look into the d-file market cap because
compound is part of the defy market we

38
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,010
compound is part of the defy market we
 

39
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,889
compound is part of the defy market we
see that most of those changes are

40
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:57,899
see that most of those changes are
 

41
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,369
see that most of those changes are
coming from compound so last week I

42
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:01,379
coming from compound so last week I
 

43
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,310
coming from compound so last week I
showed you this this chart and it was a

44
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
showed you this this chart and it was a
 

45
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,310
showed you this this chart and it was a
2.3 billion not 6.7 billion as you can

46
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,320
2.3 billion not 6.7 billion as you can
 

47
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,039
2.3 billion not 6.7 billion as you can
see most of that is coming from compound

48
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,049
see most of that is coming from compound
 

49
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,679
see most of that is coming from compound
now let's dive a little bit deeper into

50
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:12,689
now let's dive a little bit deeper into
 

51
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,590
now let's dive a little bit deeper into
this you can check what happened and if

52
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
this you can check what happened and if
 

53
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,120
this you can check what happened and if
we take a look at the compound plot

54
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,130
we take a look at the compound plot
 

55
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,870
we take a look at the compound plot
platform so compound finance we see it's

56
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
platform so compound finance we see it's
 

57
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,450
platform so compound finance we see it's
basically like a bank so you can supply

58
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:23,460
basically like a bank so you can supply
 

59
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,600
basically like a bank so you can supply
money to the environment or you can

60
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,610
money to the environment or you can
 

61
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,819
money to the environment or you can
borrow money and in the case of let's

62
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:28,829
borrow money and in the case of let's
 

63
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,850
borrow money and in the case of let's
say Bay 80 basic attention token you

64
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:31,860
say Bay 80 basic attention token you
 

65
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,340
say Bay 80 basic attention token you
will receive 27 percent and if you

66
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,350
will receive 27 percent and if you
 

67
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,440
will receive 27 percent and if you
borrow money you have to pay 34 percent

68
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,450
borrow money you have to pay 34 percent
 

69
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,749
borrow money you have to pay 34 percent
so far everything is fine now last week

70
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:40,759
so far everything is fine now last week
 

71
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,280
so far everything is fine now last week
compound was listed on coin base and

72
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,290
compound was listed on coin base and
 

73
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,800
compound was listed on coin base and
that caused a huge increase in price and

74
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:45,810
that caused a huge increase in price and
 

75
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,410
that caused a huge increase in price and
because of that this environment went

76
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:48,420
because of that this environment went
 

77
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,450
because of that this environment went
absolutely crazy and the reason is that

78
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,460
absolutely crazy and the reason is that
 

79
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,520
absolutely crazy and the reason is that
every time you take out a loan or

80
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,530
every time you take out a loan or
 

81
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,800
every time you take out a loan or
receive money you will be compensated

00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:54,810
receive money you will be compensated
 

83
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,200
receive money you will be compensated
with comps which is the native token of

84
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,210
with comps which is the native token of
 

85
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,740
with comps which is the native token of
this platform so you receive money in

86
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:00,750
this platform so you receive money in
 

87
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,920
this platform so you receive money in
other words if you take out a loan and

other words if you take out a loan and
to check that there's another website

90
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:06,509
to check that there's another website
 

91
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,430
to check that there's another website
called predictions dot exchange and if I

92
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,440
called predictions dot exchange and if I
 

93
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,460
called predictions dot exchange and if I
say I want to have 1,000 here

94
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:13,470
say I want to have 1,000 here
 

95
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,150
say I want to have 1,000 here
so enter 1,000 basic attention token and

96
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
so enter 1,000 basic attention token and
 

97
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,880
so enter 1,000 basic attention token and
I do calculate then I see that I will

98
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:19,890
I do calculate then I see that I will
 

99
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,760
I do calculate then I see that I will
receive on top of those thousand dollars

100
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:22,770
receive on top of those thousand dollars
 

101
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,360
receive on top of those thousand dollars
I will receive 17 percent interest so I

102
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,370
I will receive 17 percent interest so I
 

103
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,980
I will receive 17 percent interest so I
don't have to pay interest I will

104
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:27,990
don't have to pay interest I will
 

105
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,080
don't have to pay interest I will
receive 17 percent interest

106
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,090
receive 17 percent interest
 

107
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,440
receive 17 percent interest
now some people are clever and they take

108
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:33,450
now some people are clever and they take
 

109
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,540
now some people are clever and they take
that money and put it back into the

110
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:35,550
that money and put it back into the
 

111
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,540
that money and put it back into the
system and that's called yield farming

112
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,550
system and that's called yield farming
 

113
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,760
system and that's called yield farming
and with yield farming you can achieve

114
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:42,770
and with yield farming you can achieve
 

115
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,030
and with yield farming you can achieve
interests of over 100 percent now I have

116
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
interests of over 100 percent now I have
 

117
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,590
interests of over 100 percent now I have
to clearly say at this stage so it's a

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:48,600
to clearly say at this stage so it's a

124
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,570
young industry it's guided by software
 

125
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,350
young industry it's guided by software
and there are plenty of bucks in

and there are plenty of bucks in
 

127
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,310
and there are plenty of bucks in

129
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,370
software and also it can be hacked so
it's a very risky environment and if you

money even small amounts can be

136
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:13,800
money even small amounts can be
 

137
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,270
money even small amounts can be
dangerous because the fees can be as

dangerous because the fees can be as
 

139
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,949
dangerous because the fees can be as
high as fifteen dollars for one

00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
high as fifteen dollars for one
 

141
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,620
high as fifteen dollars for one
transaction so just to give you an

142
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:21,630
transaction so just to give you an
 

143
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,350
transaction so just to give you an
example of why one has to be careful

144
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,360
example of why one has to be careful
 

145
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,350
example of why one has to be careful
here's somebody that put money into the

146
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
here's somebody that put money into the
 

147
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,910
here's somebody that put money into the
system and took out so he was doing

148
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
system and took out so he was doing
 

149
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,160
system and took out so he was doing
yield farming and then suddenly realized

150
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,170
yield farming and then suddenly realized
 

151
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,420
yield farming and then suddenly realized
that he had much less money available

152
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:32,430
that he had much less money available
 

153
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,120
that he had much less money available
and the reason is that he was liquidated

154
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,130
and the reason is that he was liquidated
 

155
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,880
and the reason is that he was liquidated
because of the interest that he didn't

156
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:37,890
because of the interest that he didn't
 

157
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,280
because of the interest that he didn't
consider and this is a hard environment

158
