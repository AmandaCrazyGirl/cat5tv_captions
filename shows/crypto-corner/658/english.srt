coins that went higher than 15 percent
 

27
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,049
coins that went higher than 15 percent
and on the downside we've got only four

28
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,059
and on the downside we've got only four
 

29
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,520

65
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,980
theorem and Cardinal the Adonis you can
see here is full of academic people that

development and in card and oh they're

84
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:52,829
development and in card and oh they're
 

85
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,649
development and in card and oh they're
coming from another angle they're coming

86
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:54,659
coming from another angle they're coming
 

87
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,889
coming from another angle they're coming
from the intellectual angle from the

88
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:56,899
from the intellectual angle from the
 

89
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,480
from the intellectual angle from the
theoretical angle and that's what I also

90
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,490
theoretical angle and that's what I also
 

91
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,480
theoretical angle and that's what I also
took them much longer to go live rather

92
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,490
took them much longer to go live rather
 

93
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,389
took them much longer to go live rather
than like a theorem they went life very

94
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,399
than like a theorem they went life very
 

95
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,219
than like a theorem they went life very
quickly in that sense so it's

96
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:07,229
quickly in that sense so it's
 

97
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,990
quickly in that sense so it's
interesting to see which one of those

98
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,000
interesting to see which one of those
 

99
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,119
interesting to see which one of those
two block chains will have the upper

100
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:11,129
two block chains will have the upper
 

101
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:11,690
two block chains will have the upper
hand

102
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:11,700

long term
 

105
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,030
long term
now I'm going into detail of what has

106
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040
now I'm going into detail of what has
 

107
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,129
now I'm going into detail of what has
happened now I want to show you some

108
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:18,139
happened now I want to show you some
 

109
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,440
happened now I want to show you some
presentations that I really liked this

110
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,450
presentations that I really liked this
 

111
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,720
presentations that I really liked this
one here is called beef chain which is a

112
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:22,730
one here is called beef chain which is a
 

113
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,289
one here is called beef chain which is a
supplier management or supply chain

114
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:26,299
supplier management or supply chain
 

115
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:30,360
supplier management or supply chain
management protocol together with a

116
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,370
management protocol together with a
 

117
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,280
management protocol together with a
legislator from Wyoming and it

118
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,290
legislator from Wyoming and it
 

119
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,199
legislator from Wyoming and it
highlights difficulties that exist in

120
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,209
highlights difficulties that exist in
 

121
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,229
highlights difficulties that exist in
this market like here the Salmonella

122
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
this market like here the Salmonella
 

123
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,720
this market like here the Salmonella
breaks out in one of those factories the

124
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:40,730
breaks out in one of those factories the
 

125
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,209
breaks out in one of those factories the
recall can be really devastating yeah

126
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:43,219
recall can be really devastating yeah
 

127
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:44,789
recall can be really devastating yeah
like here peanut Corporation of America

128
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:44,799
like here peanut Corporation of America
 

129
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,080
like here peanut Corporation of America
that company doesn't exist anymore

130
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,090
that company doesn't exist anymore
 

131
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,940
that company doesn't exist anymore
because of the salmonella outbreak and

132
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:48,950
because of the salmonella outbreak and
 

133
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,929
because of the salmonella outbreak and
the executives were handed 28 years of

134
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:52,939
the executives were handed 28 years of
 

135
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,300
the executives were handed 28 years of
prison and so it's important to really

136
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,310
prison and so it's important to really
 

137
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,500
prison and so it's important to really
have an end-to-end tool that you can

138
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,510
have an end-to-end tool that you can
 

139
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,689
have an end-to-end tool that you can
rely on and that's what they developed

140
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:01,699
rely on and that's what they developed
 

141
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,479
rely on and that's what they developed
on the Cardinal block chain now and I

142
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:04,489
on the Cardinal block chain now and I
 

143
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,009
on the Cardinal block chain now and I
hope they one day they will also do that

144
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:06,019
hope they one day they will also do that
 

145
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,050
hope they one day they will also do that
on the medical side because I heard that

146
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,060
on the medical side because I heard that
 

147
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,520
on the medical side because I heard that
percent of all medication that you can

148
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,530
percent of all medication that you can
 

149
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,569
percent of all medication that you can
buy is fake or substandard and so such a

150
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:16,579
buy is fake or substandard and so such a
 

151
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,309
buy is fake or substandard and so such a
tool would be fantastic also in the

152
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
tool would be fantastic also in the
 

153
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,979
tool would be fantastic also in the
medical sector

154
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:19,989
medical sector
 

155
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,449
medical sector
next is onboarding so I mean in the

156
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:25,459
next is onboarding so I mean in the
 

157
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:26,789
next is onboarding so I mean in the
Western world we don't have huge

158
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
Western world we don't have huge
 

159
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,349
Western world we don't have huge
problems in getting access to banks or

160
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:29,359
problems in getting access to banks or
 

161
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,479
problems in getting access to banks or
loans in other countries like here this

162
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:31,489
loans in other countries like here this
 

163
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,860
loans in other countries like here this
is Africa for example it looks

164
