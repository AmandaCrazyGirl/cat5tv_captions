welcome to the crypto corner it has been
a fantastic week again not of course if

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,440
a fantastic week again not of course if
 

9
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,200
a fantastic week again not of course if
we look into the numbers like Bitcoin

10
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,210
we look into the numbers like Bitcoin
 

11
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,460
we look into the numbers like Bitcoin
state around 9200 or theorem around 240

12
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,470
state around 9200 or theorem around 240
 

13
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,930
state around 9200 or theorem around 240
so no huge developments in this area

14
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:17,940
so no huge developments in this area
 

15
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,810
so no huge developments in this area
here but if we sort by 7 days then we

16
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:20,820
here but if we sort by 7 days then we
 

17
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,160
here but if we sort by 7 days then we
see that we had some coins that

18
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,170
see that we had some coins that
 

19
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,550
see that we had some coins that
increased by over 100% like Elrond dibi

20
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560
increased by over 100% like Elrond dibi
 

21
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,880
increased by over 100% like Elrond dibi
60 percent over 20 coins increased more

22
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:28,890
60 percent over 20 coins increased more
 

23
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,519
60 percent over 20 coins increased more
than 15-percent and only four coins lost

24
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:31,529
than 15-percent and only four coins lost
 

25
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,330
than 15-percent and only four coins lost
more than fifteen percent so a positive

26
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:35,340
more than fifteen percent so a positive
 

27
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,639
more than fifteen percent so a positive
development from that point of view in

28
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:37,649
development from that point of view in
 

29
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,040
development from that point of view in
the market if we look we compare for

30
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,050
the market if we look we compare for
 

31
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,619
the market if we look we compare for
example the the history of the big coins

32
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:45,629
example the the history of the big coins
 

33
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,029
example the the history of the big coins
in the d5 market like maker or or khyber

34
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:50,039
in the d5 market like maker or or khyber
 

35
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,060
in the d5 market like maker or or khyber
or 0x when compared with the profit of

00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,070
or 0x when compared with the profit of
 

37
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,860
or 0x when compared with the profit of
theorem then we'll see that the theorem

38
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:57,870
theorem then we'll see that the theorem
 

39
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,319
theorem then we'll see that the theorem
state more or less flat at 0% so I lost

40
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:00,329
state more or less flat at 0% so I lost
 

41
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,039
state more or less flat at 0% so I lost
minus 0.3 percent but all these others

42
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:04,049
minus 0.3 percent but all these others
 

43
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,380
minus 0.3 percent but all these others
gained over thousand percent so huge

44
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:06,390
gained over thousand percent so huge
 

45
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,149
gained over thousand percent so huge
development that is happening under the

00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
development that is happening under the
 

47
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,520
development that is happening under the
hood in the crypto market and so one has

48
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:10,530
hood in the crypto market and so one has
 

49
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,670
hood in the crypto market and so one has
to be careful also at the same time on

no purpose and the price went up by over
 

101
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,500
no purpose and the price went up by over
forty fifty percent in one day next few

102
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,510
forty fifty percent in one day next few
 

103
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,839
forty fifty percent in one day next few
days it came down again so be careful

104
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:23,849
days it came down again so be careful
 

105
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,160
days it came down again so be careful
with these things don't participate

106
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,170
with these things don't participate
 

107
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,800
with these things don't participate
there the moment you hear about some

108
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:27,810
there the moment you hear about some
 

109
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,229
there the moment you hear about some
pump it will still be too late again

110
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
pump it will still be too late again
 

111
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,630
pump it will still be too late again
because those that started that pump are

112
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
because those that started that pump are
 

113
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,300
because those that started that pump are
already planning on how to leave that

114
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,310
already planning on how to leave that
 

115
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,910
already planning on how to leave that
one next is if we look into compound and

116
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
one next is if we look into compound and
 

117
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,300
one next is if we look into compound and
if we want to borrow rent some money and

118
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,310
if we want to borrow rent some money and
 

119
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,190
if we want to borrow rent some money and
then there is some collateral factor in

120
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,200
then there is some collateral factor in
 

121
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,170
then there is some collateral factor in
here yeah so sixty percent in other

122
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,180
here yeah so sixty percent in other
 

123
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,309
here yeah so sixty percent in other
words if I put in 100 percent then I can

124
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
words if I put in 100 percent then I can
 

125
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,159
words if I put in 100 percent then I can
take sixty percent out so there's over

126
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:55,169
take sixty percent out so there's over
 

127
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,740
take sixty percent out so there's over
an over collateralization in in this

128
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:57,750
an over collateralization in in this
 

129
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,190
an over collateralization in in this
industry and that's how most of these

130
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,200
industry and that's how most of these
 

131
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,399
industry and that's how most of these
are staying on a fairly low risk basis

132
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:04,409
are staying on a fairly low risk basis
 

133
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,339
are staying on a fairly low risk basis
but there has been a new development of

134
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:07,349
but there has been a new development of
 

135
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,220
but there has been a new development of
is the first one that is starting now

136
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,230
is the first one that is starting now
 

137
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,649
is the first one that is starting now
with credit ik credit allocation so in

138
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:12,659
with credit ik credit allocation so in
 

139
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,539
with credit ik credit allocation so in
other words you can have a credit

140
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:14,549
other words you can have a credit
 

141
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,339
other words you can have a credit
without even putting up some collateral

142
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:16,349
without even putting up some collateral
 

143
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,979
without even putting up some collateral
and the way they solve that is that you

144
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:18,989
and the way they solve that is that you
 

145
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,500
and the way they solve that is that you
have to sign a contract with a person

146
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,510
have to sign a contract with a person
 

147
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,990
have to sign a contract with a person
that gives you all whom you give the

148
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
that gives you all whom you give the
 

149
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,780
that gives you all whom you give the
money and it will be sorted out in an

150
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:26,790
money and it will be sorted out in an
 

151
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,750
money and it will be sorted out in an
illegal or regular court in case there

152
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
illegal or regular court in case there
 

153
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,550
illegal or regular court in case there
is a default so that's an interesting

154
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,560
is a default so that's an interesting
 

155
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,729
is a default so that's an interesting
development I find now another

156
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:34,739
development I find now another
 

157
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,170
development I find now another
interesting development but more on the

158
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,180
interesting development but more on the
