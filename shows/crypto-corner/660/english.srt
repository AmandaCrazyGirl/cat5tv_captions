so um in the last 30 days band increased
 

113
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,230
so um in the last 30 days band increased
by 600 percent

114

by 600 percent
 

115
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,069
by 600 percent
um currently we've got a retracement of

116
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
um currently we've got a retracement of
 

117
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,350
um currently we've got a retracement of

uh also i would say this is normal here

120
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
uh also i would say this is normal here
 

121
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,430
uh also i would say this is normal here
and if you're interested

122

and if you're interested
in buying something then there's some

124
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
in buying something then there's some
 

125
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,710
in buying something then there's some
interesting numbers like for example

126
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
interesting numbers like for example
 

127
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,070
interesting numbers like for example
example

128
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
example
 

129
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,750
example
what was the all-time high it was 17

130
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
what was the all-time high it was 17
 

131
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,350
what was the all-time high it was 17
so that's uh uh one day ago

132
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
so that's uh uh one day ago
 

133
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,710
so that's uh uh one day ago
as you can see here one day ago we

134
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
as you can see here one day ago we
 

135
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,030
as you can see here one day ago we
achieved all-time high here

136
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
achieved all-time high here
 

137
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,030
achieved all-time high here
and the all-time low which was november

138
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
and the all-time low which was november
 

139
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,070
and the all-time low which was november
25th on

140
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
25th on
 

141
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,710
25th on
2019 so nine months ago it increased

142
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
2019 so nine months ago it increased
 

143
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,630
2019 so nine months ago it increased
seven

144
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:33,640
seven
 

145
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,309
seven
639 percent from that day

146
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
639 percent from that day
 

147
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,910
639 percent from that day
so that's interesting statistics so

148
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
so that's interesting statistics so
 

149
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,509
so that's interesting statistics so

that
just had its all-time high because

154
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
just had its all-time high because
 

155
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,030
just had its all-time high because
i assume that short term there will be

so this is how you read the my plus two

216
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
so this is how you read the my plus two
 

217
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,670
so this is how you read the my plus two
percent and the minus two percent it's

218
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
percent and the minus two percent it's
 

219
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,070
percent and the minus two percent it's
uh

220
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
uh
 

221
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,470
uh
it's an interesting number if you want

222
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
it's an interesting number if you want

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,309
it's an interesting number if you want
to invest in coins because some of those

224
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319

225
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,190
to invest in coins because some of those
coins

226
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
