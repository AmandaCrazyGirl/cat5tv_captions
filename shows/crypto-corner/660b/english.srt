these are the two places i would

202
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
these are the two places i would
 

203
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,430
these are the two places i would
recommend they're regulated so they're

204

recommend they're regulated so they're
 

205

recommend they're regulated so they're
serious uh companies from that point of

206
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
serious uh companies from that point of
 

207
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,750
serious uh companies from that point of
view

208
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
view
 

209
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,869
view
then i would uh only recommend

210
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
then i would uh only recommend
 

211
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,630
then i would uh only recommend
you going into uh the

212

you going into uh the
 

213
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,509
you going into uh the
top three coins uh so in this case it's

214
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
top three coins uh so in this case it's
 

215
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,910
top three coins uh so in this case it's
bitcoin ethereum or xrp

216
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
bitcoin ethereum or xrp
 

217
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,910
bitcoin ethereum or xrp
um reason being is you've got the

218
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
um reason being is you've got the
 

219
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,270
um reason being is you've got the
liquidity here

220
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
liquidity here
 

221
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,589
liquidity here
and as you've seen in the last few weeks

222
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
and as you've seen in the last few weeks
