00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
that will be exactly implemented so
 

103
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,389
that will be exactly implemented so
until then we will have to pay higher

104

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
in there with just hundred dollars
 

113
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,910

uh token and 40 percent i keep
 

243
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,310
uh token and 40 percent i keep
in that token so that's my strategy

244
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
in that token so that's my strategy
 

245
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,390

if a token went goes higher than a
 

249
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,710
if a token went goes higher than a
100 percent why because with all those

250
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
100 percent why because with all those
 

251
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,030
100 percent why because with all those
tokens that go up crazy in a few days

252
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
tokens that go up crazy in a few days
 

253
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,430
tokens that go up crazy in a few days
they'll come down again it's it's always
