and yes you should definitely be part of
 

39
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,910
and yes you should definitely be part of
this year now

40
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
this year now
 

41
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,389
this year now
where is this coming from and if we look

42
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
where is this coming from and if we look
 

43
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,549
where is this coming from and if we look
at this website here you can see that if

44
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
at this website here you can see that if
 

45
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,430
at this website here you can see that if
you would provide ample eth as liquidity

46
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
you would provide ample eth as liquidity
 

47
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,190
you would provide ample eth as liquidity
you would get over a thousand percent

48
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
you would get over a thousand percent
 

49
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,630
you would get over a thousand percent
apr and that

50
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
apr and that
 

51
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,590
apr and that
sounds like magic right it doesn't sound

52
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
sounds like magic right it doesn't sound
 

53
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,270
sounds like magic right it doesn't sound
very real especially if you would put

54
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
very real especially if you would put
 

55
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,470
very real especially if you would put
money in your normal account in your

56
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
money in your normal account in your
 

57
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,590
money in your normal account in your
traditional bank

58
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
traditional bank
 

59
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,110
traditional bank
you would probably get 0.5 apr

60
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
you would probably get 0.5 apr
 

61
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,070
you would probably get 0.5 apr
so why is this number so big and what

62
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
so why is this number so big and what
 

63
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,149
so why is this number so big and what
i'm going to do now is i'm going to go

64
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
i'm going to do now is i'm going to go
 

65
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,070
i'm going to do now is i'm going to go
into the detail of where this number is

66
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
into the detail of where this number is
 

67
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,350
into the detail of where this number is
coming from

68
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
coming from
 

69
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,390
coming from
and i'm not going to be going too much

70
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
and i'm not going to be going too much
 

71
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,149
and i'm not going to be going too much
into too much detail

72
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
into too much detail
 

73
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,710
into too much detail
so i'm simplifying a lot but you will

74
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
so i'm simplifying a lot but you will
 

75
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,070
so i'm simplifying a lot but you will
get the idea

76
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
get the idea
 

77
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,230
get the idea
the first part is if we look at the

78
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
the first part is if we look at the
 

79
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,590
the first part is if we look at the
rates

80
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
rates
 

81
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,469
rates
of where the market is in the in the

82
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
of where the market is in the in the
 

83
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,590
of where the market is in the in the
crypto market

84
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
crypto market
 

85
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,109
crypto market
it's not that much different from the

86
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
it's not that much different from the
 

87
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,069
it's not that much different from the
traditional bank yeah so usdc

88
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
traditional bank yeah so usdc
 

89
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,109
traditional bank yeah so usdc
if i would provide usdc's to to

90
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
if i would provide usdc's to to
 

91
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,910
if i would provide usdc's to to
uh for example ava i would get 2.1

92
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
uh for example ava i would get 2.1
 

93
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,030
uh for example ava i would get 2.1
percent

94
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
percent
 

95
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,789
percent
uh interest if i would borrow at other

96
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
uh interest if i would borrow at other
 

97
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,270
uh interest if i would borrow at other
um usdc then i would got 4.4 percent

98
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
um usdc then i would got 4.4 percent
 

99
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,270
um usdc then i would got 4.4 percent
so far so good right so that's not

100
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
so far so good right so that's not
 

101
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,429
so far so good right so that's not
different so that's part one part two

102
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
different so that's part one part two
 

103
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,149
different so that's part one part two
is if i would provide liquidity and for

104
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
is if i would provide liquidity and for
 

105
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,789
is if i would provide liquidity and for
that we go to something called uniswap

106
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
that we go to something called uniswap
 

107
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,830
that we go to something called uniswap
and uniswap is where you can exchange

108
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
and uniswap is where you can exchange
 

109
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,950
and uniswap is where you can exchange
uh tokens so if you've got eth and you

110
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
uh tokens so if you've got eth and you
 

111
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,230
uh tokens so if you've got eth and you
want to buy

112
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
want to buy
 

113
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,749
want to buy
let's say band then as you can see down

114
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
let's say band then as you can see down
 

115
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,229
let's say band then as you can see down
here

116
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
here
 

117
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,630
here
you would have to provide a liquidity

118
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
you would have to provide a liquidity
 

119
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,229
you would have to provide a liquidity
provider you would resear you would have

120
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
provider you would resear you would have
 

121
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,309
provider you would resear you would have
to pay a liquidity provider fee

122
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
to pay a liquidity provider fee
 

123
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,150
to pay a liquidity provider fee
and this this year and if you would

124
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
and this this year and if you would
 

125
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,990
and this this year and if you would
provide money into this pool so if you

126
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
provide money into this pool so if you
 

127
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,150
provide money into this pool so if you
in other words you provide eth and band

128
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
in other words you provide eth and band
 

129
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,030
in other words you provide eth and band
so that other people can participate in

130
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
so that other people can participate in
 

131
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,830
so that other people can participate in
this year

132
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
this year
 

133
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,589
this year
then you would get part of this uh fee

134
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
then you would get part of this uh fee
 

135
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,309
then you would get part of this uh fee
most part even yeah so it's very simple

136
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
most part even yeah so it's very simple
 

137
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,509
most part even yeah so it's very simple
you click on pool

138
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
you click on pool
 

139
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,150
you click on pool
you click on add liquidity you say what

140
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
you click on add liquidity you say what
 

141
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,430
you click on add liquidity you say what
is it going to be

142
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
is it going to be
 

143
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,869
is it going to be
and then you approve this year and

144
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
and then you approve this year and

147
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,190
that's it that's all you have to do
so that's how you provide liquidity

148
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
so that's how you provide liquidity

to secure the network um
 

249
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,390
to secure the network um
by proof of stake then tesla's would

250
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
by proof of stake then tesla's would
 

251
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,870
by proof of stake then tesla's would
give me in this case through coinbase

252
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
give me in this case through coinbase
 

253
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,790
give me in this case through coinbase
five percent staking fee yeah that's

254
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
five percent staking fee yeah that's
 

255
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,590
five percent staking fee yeah that's
just by providing by keeping my money

259
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,790
my teslas in a wallet and not using it
i would receive five percent so there

260
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
i would receive five percent so there
 

261
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,629
i would receive five percent so there
are a few incentives that are compared

262
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
are a few incentives that are compared
 

263
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,670
are a few incentives that are compared
to the traditional market equivalent and

264
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
to the traditional market equivalent and
 

265
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,110
to the traditional market equivalent and
not that much different

266
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120

and that's the strengths of this year so
 

293
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,830
and that's the strengths of this year so
these software packages

294
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
these software packages
 

295
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,310
these software packages
or software platforms don't have high

296
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
or software platforms don't have high
 

297
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,870
or software platforms don't have high

costs
 

299
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,590
costs
in building people and so on just a

300
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
in building people and so on just a
 

301
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,150
in building people and so on just a
bunch of people that coded something

302
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
bunch of people that coded something
 

303
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,550
bunch of people that coded something
they put it online and that's why they

304
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
they put it online and that's why they
 

305
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,350
they put it online and that's why they
can

306
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
can
 

307
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,870
can
can offer you so high interest rates

308
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
can offer you so high interest rates
 

309
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,950
can offer you so high interest rates
now before you really dive into this

310
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
now before you really dive into this
 

311
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,070
now before you really dive into this
yeah i would like to show you two

312
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
yeah i would like to show you two
 

313
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,749
yeah i would like to show you two
websites that are important

314
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
websites that are important
 

315
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,670
websites that are important
the first one is here defy safety dot

316
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
the first one is here defy safety dot
 

317
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,310
the first one is here defy safety dot
com

318
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
com
 

319
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,950
com
because here you can see which platform

320
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
because here you can see which platform
 

321
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,790
because here you can see which platform
is really safe and which one isn't safe

322
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
is really safe and which one isn't safe
 

323
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,189
is really safe and which one isn't safe
so if i take ave for example

324
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
so if i take ave for example
 

325
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,270
so if i take ave for example
which is one of the big ones then they

326
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
which is one of the big ones then they
 

327
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,510
which is one of the big ones then they

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
here with the code so
 

347
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,110
here with the code so
it's a third party that reviews your

it's a third party that reviews your
 

349
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,870
it's a third party that reviews your
code how good it is

350
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
code how good it is
 

351
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,550
code how good it is
so this is pretty good but on the other

352
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
so this is pretty good but on the other
 

353

that bring in principle did not do
anything really

358
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
anything really
 

359
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,870
anything really
i mean they just put the code online and

360
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
i mean they just put the code online and
 

361
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,550
i mean they just put the code online and
didn't even test it

362
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
didn't even test it
 

363
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,950
didn't even test it
beforehand there's nothing is documented

364
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
beforehand there's nothing is documented
