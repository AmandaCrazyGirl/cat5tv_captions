before the correction but it's
 

27
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,150
before the correction but it's
recovering nicely and as you can see

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
recovering nicely and as you can see
 

29
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,750
recovering nicely and as you can see
we see a lot of green in

30
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
we see a lot of green in
 

31
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,229
we see a lot of green in
in the market cap but if we start after

32
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
in the market cap but if we start after
 

33
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,190

our seven days
 

35
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,630
our seven days
we see the usual picture d5 d5 d5

36
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
we see the usual picture d5 d5 d5
 

37
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,990
we see the usual picture d5 d5 d5
d5 and so on and so on and if we sort

38
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
d5 and so on and so on and if we sort
 

39
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,590
d5 and so on and so on and if we sort
and by the negative

40
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
and by the negative
 

41
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,869
and by the negative
it's similar also d5 d5 d5

42
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
it's similar also d5 d5 d5
 

43
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,470
it's similar also d5 d5 d5
and so we get a lot of questions in

44
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
and so we get a lot of questions in
 

45
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,470
and so we get a lot of questions in
regards to d5

46
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
regards to d5

why an apr of 889 is possible

72
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
why an apr of 889 is possible
 

73
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,789
why an apr of 889 is possible
and if you click on this

74
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
and if you click on this
 

75
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,190
and if you click on this
option here then you see that the smart

76
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
option here then you see that the smart
 

77
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,830
option here then you see that the smart
contract

78
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
contract
 

79
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,149
contract
risk level is high and the impermanent

80
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
risk level is high and the impermanent
 

81
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,230
risk level is high and the impermanent
loss level is high

82
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
loss level is high
 

83
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,390
loss level is high
and so i explained to you that smart

84
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
and so i explained to you that smart
 

85
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,109
and so i explained to you that smart
contract that's something that you can

86
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
contract that's something that you can

that will explain to you which protocol

90
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
that will explain to you which protocol
 

91
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,469
that will explain to you which protocol
is safe and which one isn't

92
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
is safe and which one isn't
 

93
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,550
is safe and which one isn't
so if it's something in red i would

94
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
so if it's something in red i would
 

95
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,149
so if it's something in red i would
definitely not touch that

96
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
definitely not touch that
 

97
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,990
definitely not touch that
if it's green then yes it has been

98
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
if it's green then yes it has been
 

99
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,190
if it's green then yes it has been
audited and it's

100
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
audited and it's
 

101
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,709
audited and it's
probably safe the other thing

102
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
probably safe the other thing
 

103
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,950
probably safe the other thing
is the impermanent loss and to explain

104
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
is the impermanent loss and to explain
 

105
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,469
is the impermanent loss and to explain
how that one works

106
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
how that one works
 

107
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,990
how that one works
because everybody has got a question

108
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
because everybody has got a question
 

109
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,830
because everybody has got a question
what is impermanent loss just those two

110
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
what is impermanent loss just those two
 

111
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,149
what is impermanent loss just those two
words are really weird anyway

112
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
words are really weird anyway
 

113
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,790
words are really weird anyway
so if we look at the traditional market

114
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
so if we look at the traditional market
 

115
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,790
so if we look at the traditional market
yeah like here i pulled up binance

116
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
yeah like here i pulled up binance
 

117
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,390
yeah like here i pulled up binance
uh with exam and bdc uh

118
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
uh with exam and bdc uh
 

119
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,150
uh with exam and bdc uh
then you see here that you've got the

120
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
then you see here that you've got the
 

121
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,990
then you see here that you've got the
order book people want to sell and

122
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
order book people want to sell and
 

123
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,910
order book people want to sell and
people that want to buy

124
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
people that want to buy
 

125
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,550
people that want to buy
and in the middle somewhere they find

126
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
and in the middle somewhere they find
 

127
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:22,949
and in the middle somewhere they find
the

128
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
the
 

129
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,430
the
mutual prices acceptable but you've got

130
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
mutual prices acceptable but you've got
 

131
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,150
mutual prices acceptable but you've got
people that

132
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
people that
 

133
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,750
people that
have got different price views and

134
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
have got different price views and
 

135
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,390
have got different price views and
they're just willing to wait or not wait

136
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
they're just willing to wait or not wait
 

137
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,589
they're just willing to wait or not wait
and that's not the case in protocols

138
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
and that's not the case in protocols
 

139
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,990
and that's not the case in protocols
like uniswap

140
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
like uniswap
 

141
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
like uniswap
as you probably saw in uni swap you

142
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
as you probably saw in uni swap you
 

143
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,910
as you probably saw in uni swap you
don't have an order book

144
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
don't have an order book
 

145
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,910
don't have an order book
and the way that that's set up is

146
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
and the way that that's set up is
 

147
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,309
and the way that that's set up is
explained through this chart here

148
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
explained through this chart here
 

149
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,630
explained through this chart here
so at the beginning when you build up a

150
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
so at the beginning when you build up a
 

151
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,070
so at the beginning when you build up a
pool in uniswap

152
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
pool in uniswap
 

153
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,229
pool in uniswap
you decide how many ethereum and in this

154
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
you decide how many ethereum and in this
 

155
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,070
you decide how many ethereum and in this
case how many die you're putting into

156
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
case how many die you're putting into
 

157
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,350
case how many die you're putting into
the pool

158
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
the pool
 

159
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,949
the pool
and that's the ratio that's fixed and so

160
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
and that's the ratio that's fixed and so
 

161
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,270
and that's the ratio that's fixed and so
of course the prices are changing and if

162
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
of course the prices are changing and if
 

163
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,030
of course the prices are changing and if
the prices are changing a little bit

164
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
the prices are changing a little bit
 

165
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,869
the prices are changing a little bit
it's no problem but if the prices are

166
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
it's no problem but if the prices are
 

167
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,949
it's no problem but if the prices are
changing a lot it is a problem and

168
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
changing a lot it is a problem and
 

169
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,430
changing a lot it is a problem and
that's called impermanent loss

170
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
that's called impermanent loss
 

171
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,630
that's called impermanent loss
and what i've done here for you is um

172
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
and what i've done here for you is um
 

173
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,270
and what i've done here for you is um
i set up a calculation as an excel

174
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
i set up a calculation as an excel
 

175
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,390
i set up a calculation as an excel
spreadsheet

176
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
spreadsheet
 

177
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,670
spreadsheet
so you can see here for example when we

178
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
so you can see here for example when we
 

179
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,710
so you can see here for example when we
have got a protocol ethereum and sushi

180
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
have got a protocol ethereum and sushi
 

181
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,750
have got a protocol ethereum and sushi
um i also a pool we provide liquidity

182
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
um i also a pool we provide liquidity
 

183
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,309
um i also a pool we provide liquidity
for pool

184
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
for pool
 

185
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,030
for pool
ethereum and sushi the price when we

186
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
ethereum and sushi the price when we
 

187
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,110
ethereum and sushi the price when we
open that pool is 386

188
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
open that pool is 386
 

189
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,309
open that pool is 386
and the sushi price is 504

190
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
and the sushi price is 504
 

191
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,509
and the sushi price is 504
and today the price went down a little

192
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
and today the price went down a little
 

193
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:35,830
and today the price went down a little
bit

194
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
bit
 

195
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,030
bit
in ethereum it's now 375.65

196
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
in ethereum it's now 375.65
 

197
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,509
in ethereum it's now 375.65
and sushi are left here at 504 so the

198
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
and sushi are left here at 504 so the
 

199
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,270
and sushi are left here at 504 so the
impairment loss is about zero percent in

200
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
impairment loss is about zero percent in
 

201
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,910
impairment loss is about zero percent in
other words

202
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
other words
 

203
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,589
other words
you have not lost any of your money but

204
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
you have not lost any of your money but
 

205
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,710
you have not lost any of your money but
if this price changes significantly then

206
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
if this price changes significantly then
 

207
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,509
if this price changes significantly then
at the moment

208
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
at the moment
 

209
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,710
at the moment
it's our it's around three dollars then

210
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
it's our it's around three dollars then
 

211
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,470
it's our it's around three dollars then
there's an impermanent loss of 2.9

212
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
there's an impermanent loss of 2.9
 

213
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,190
there's an impermanent loss of 2.9
percent so you lost 2.9 percent of your

214
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
percent so you lost 2.9 percent of your
 

215
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,630
percent so you lost 2.9 percent of your
assets in this in this case if we

216
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
assets in this in this case if we
 

217
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,110
assets in this in this case if we
make that difference bigger so let's say

218
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
make that difference bigger so let's say
 

219
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,990
make that difference bigger so let's say
say

220
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
say
 

221
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,110
say
that this is not three this is uh

222
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
that this is not three this is uh
 

223
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,350
that this is not three this is uh
zero point uh four

224
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
zero point uh four
 

225
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,390
zero point uh four
then you see you lost 47.2 percent it's

226
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
then you see you lost 47.2 percent it's
 

227
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,189
then you see you lost 47.2 percent it's
not

228
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
not
 

229
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,150
not
that you lost the sushi part of your

230
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
that you lost the sushi part of your
 

231
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,069
that you lost the sushi part of your
portfolio because remember

232
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
portfolio because remember
 

233
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,629
portfolio because remember
there's always this balance you lost

234
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
there's always this balance you lost
 

235
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,469
there's always this balance you lost
47 of your whole pool so the good

236
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
47 of your whole pool so the good
 

237
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,550
47 of your whole pool so the good
money that in this case is theorem that

238
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
money that in this case is theorem that
 

239
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,749
money that in this case is theorem that
stayed stable

240
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
stayed stable
 

241
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,070
stayed stable
you lost 47 of that one too and that's

242
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
you lost 47 of that one too and that's
 

243
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,469
you lost 47 of that one too and that's
the risk that you're carrying here

244
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
the risk that you're carrying here
 

245
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,310
the risk that you're carrying here
and that's a problem with all these d5

246
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
and that's a problem with all these d5
 

247
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,629
and that's a problem with all these d5
protocols like here moon which is

248
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
protocols like here moon which is
 

249
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,550
protocols like here moon which is
another similar to sushi you have got an

250
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
another similar to sushi you have got an
 

251
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,909
another similar to sushi you have got an
apy

252
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
apy
 

253
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,430
apy
of three thousand percent sounds

254
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
of three thousand percent sounds
 

255
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,469
of three thousand percent sounds
fantastic but have you checked the

256
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
fantastic but have you checked the
 

257
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,510
fantastic but have you checked the
the moon price yeah so let's do that we

258
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
the moon price yeah so let's do that we
 

259
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,110
the moon price yeah so let's do that we
if we go into here and

260
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
if we go into here and
 

261
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,550
if we go into here and
say moon then you'll see the risk that

262
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
say moon then you'll see the risk that
 

263
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,590
say moon then you'll see the risk that
you're carrying by just

264
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
you're carrying by just
 

265
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,469
you're carrying by just
investing in this pool yeah so let's go

266
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
investing in this pool yeah so let's go
 

267
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,230
investing in this pool yeah so let's go
14 days

268
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
14 days
 

269
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,550
14 days
so at one stage it was 12 and now it's

270
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
so at one stage it was 12 and now it's
 

271
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,070
so at one stage it was 12 and now it's
around 2.90

272
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
around 2.90
 

273
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,990
around 2.90
so you will have lost significantly

274
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
so you will have lost significantly
 

275
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,510
so you will have lost significantly
amount whether it's go up or down

276
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
amount whether it's go up or down
 

277
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,550
amount whether it's go up or down
doesn't matter it's always the

278
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
doesn't matter it's always the
 

279
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,830
doesn't matter it's always the
relationship

280
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
relationship
 

281
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,909
relationship
the relation that is important so you

282
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
the relation that is important so you
 

283
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,749
the relation that is important so you
will have lost a lot of money by

284
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
will have lost a lot of money by
 

285
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,590
will have lost a lot of money by
investing in this pool and that's

286
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
investing in this pool and that's
 

287
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,430
investing in this pool and that's
exactly the risk that you're carrying

288
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
exactly the risk that you're carrying
 

289
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,950
exactly the risk that you're carrying
which is called impermanent loss

290
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
which is called impermanent loss
 

291
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,469
which is called impermanent loss
yeah so that's where you have to be

292
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
yeah so that's where you have to be
 

293
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,390
yeah so that's where you have to be
really careful you have to check if you

294
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
really careful you have to check if you
 

295
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,830
really careful you have to check if you
invest in one of those

296
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
invest in one of those
 

297
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,550
invest in one of those
crazy pools you have to be really on top

298
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
crazy pools you have to be really on top
 

299
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,629
crazy pools you have to be really on top
of that and check it every hour

300
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
of that and check it every hour
 

301
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,710
of that and check it every hour
even during the night that the price

302
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
even during the night that the price
 

303
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,310
even during the night that the price
doesn't change because you know

304
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
doesn't change because you know
 

305
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,629
doesn't change because you know
in cryptos those prices can change in a

306
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
in cryptos those prices can change in a
 

307
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,070
in cryptos those prices can change in a
second

308
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
second
 

309
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,550
second
so i hope you understood what um

310
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
so i hope you understood what um
 

311
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,310
so i hope you understood what um
impermanent loss is

312
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
impermanent loss is
 

313
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,469
impermanent loss is
and how risky that is if you invest in

314
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
and how risky that is if you invest in
 

315
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,230
and how risky that is if you invest in
these coins and they all are risky so

316
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
these coins and they all are risky so
 

317
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,510
these coins and they all are risky so
there is not one

318
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
there is not one
 

319
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,230
there is not one
where you can say that this is a safe

320
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
where you can say that this is a safe
 

321
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,350
where you can say that this is a safe
bet and you'll get your 199 percent

322
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
bet and you'll get your 199 percent
 

323
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,110
bet and you'll get your 199 percent
just do the calculation this formula

324
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
just do the calculation this formula
 

325
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,550
just do the calculation this formula
