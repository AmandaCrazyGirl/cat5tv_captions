00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,950
welcome back to the world of cryptos
welcome back to the crypto corner

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
welcome back to the crypto corner

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,950
welcome back to the crypto corner
today i have got a different treat for

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
today i have got a different treat for
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,870
today i have got a different treat for
you and this is something that you can

10
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
you and this is something that you can
 

11
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,430
you and this is something that you can
use

12
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
use
 

13
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,190
use
with your friends in the library or on

14
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
with your friends in the library or on
 

15
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,910
with your friends in the library or on
the bar and to impress them

16
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
the bar and to impress them
 

17
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,590
the bar and to impress them
with some special knowledge that you

18
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
with some special knowledge that you
 

19
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,150
with some special knowledge that you
have around the bitcoin blockchain

20
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
have around the bitcoin blockchain
 

21
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,390
have around the bitcoin blockchain
and the big question always is how safe

22
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
and the big question always is how safe
 

23
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,390
and the big question always is how safe
is bitcoin and for that i prepared a

24
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
is bitcoin and for that i prepared a
 

25
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,269
is bitcoin and for that i prepared a
little

26
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
little
 

27
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,349
little
uh presentation so let's dive into it

28
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
uh presentation so let's dive into it
 

29
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,350
uh presentation so let's dive into it
so how safe is bitcoin and let's take a

30
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
so how safe is bitcoin and let's take a
 

31
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,270
so how safe is bitcoin and let's take a
look at the components of the

32
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
look at the components of the
 

33
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,830
look at the components of the
bitcoin blockchain and these are the

34
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
bitcoin blockchain and these are the
 

35
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,510
bitcoin blockchain and these are the
components you've got the blockchain

36
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
components you've got the blockchain
 

37
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,030
components you've got the blockchain
with the genesis block so the first

38
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
with the genesis block so the first
 

39
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,910
with the genesis block so the first
block

40
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
block
 

41
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,910
block
and then this is the current block and

42
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
and then this is the current block and
 

43
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,670
and then this is the current block and
then you've got miners

44
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
then you've got miners
 

45
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,830
then you've got miners
that are competing to add your

46
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
that are competing to add your
 

47
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,190
that are competing to add your
transactional

48
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
transactional
 

49
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,029
transactional
all the transactions to the blockchain

50
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
all the transactions to the blockchain
 

51
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,549
all the transactions to the blockchain
and for that

52
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
and for that
 

53
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,110
and for that
they have a calculation uh it's like a

54
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
they have a calculation uh it's like a
 

55
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,110
they have a calculation uh it's like a
very simple one it's just finding like

56
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
very simple one it's just finding like
 

57
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,990
very simple one it's just finding like
like a very simple

58
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
like a very simple
 

59
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,510
like a very simple
puzzle so it's not a big deal um

60
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
puzzle so it's not a big deal um
 

61
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,950
puzzle so it's not a big deal um
in what the the work they have to do but

62
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
in what the the work they have to do but
 

63
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,789
in what the the work they have to do but
there has been an evolution and type of

64
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
there has been an evolution and type of
 

65
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,950
there has been an evolution and type of
machines that are doing this type of

66
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
machines that are doing this type of
 

67
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,910
machines that are doing this type of
work

68
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
work
 

69
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,350
work
and so back in the early days in 2009

70
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
and so back in the early days in 2009
 

71
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,789
and so back in the early days in 2009
when bitcoin was started

72
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
when bitcoin was started
 

73
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,670
when bitcoin was started
we were using normal laptops very simple

74
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
we were using normal laptops very simple
 

75
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,149
we were using normal laptops very simple
thing

76
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
thing
 

77
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,310
thing
computer was doing the job perfectly

78
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
computer was doing the job perfectly
 

79
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,590
computer was doing the job perfectly
well

80
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
well
 

81
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,990
well
and as you know every 10 minutes a block

82
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
and as you know every 10 minutes a block
 

83
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,230
and as you know every 10 minutes a block
is created

84
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
is created
 

85
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,270
is created
that's that's part of the consensus and

86
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
that's that's part of the consensus and
 

87
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,149
that's that's part of the consensus and
therefore

88
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
therefore
 

89
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,069
therefore
the more computer we're attaching to the

90
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
the more computer we're attaching to the
 

91
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,190
the more computer we're attaching to the
system

92
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
system
 

93
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,469
system
the difficulty had to be increased and

94
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
the difficulty had to be increased and
 

95
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,149
the difficulty had to be increased and
so in 2011 graphic cards

96
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
so in 2011 graphic cards
 

97
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,069
so in 2011 graphic cards
were the it so you couldn't use a

98
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
were the it so you couldn't use a
 

99
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,590
were the it so you couldn't use a
computer anymore you had to use a

100
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
computer anymore you had to use a
 

101
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,789
computer anymore you had to use a
graphic card

102
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
graphic card
 

103
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,870
graphic card
and that continued until about 2013

104
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
and that continued until about 2013
 

105
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,710
and that continued until about 2013
when so-called ac computers were

106
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
when so-called ac computers were
 

107
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,310
when so-called ac computers were
invented and these computers the only

108
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
invented and these computers the only
 

109
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,429
invented and these computers the only
thing they do

110
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
thing they do
 

111
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,109
thing they do
is they do these

112
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
is they do these
 

113
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,550
is they do these
crypto transactions they don't do

114
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
crypto transactions they don't do
 

115
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,709
crypto transactions they don't do
anything else you can't run windows on

116
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
anything else you can't run windows on
 

117
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,590
anything else you can't run windows on
them

118
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
them
 

119
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,789
them
just the simple hash calculations that

120
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
just the simple hash calculations that
 

121
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,429
just the simple hash calculations that
they do and nothing else

122
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
they do and nothing else
 

123
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,790
they do and nothing else
so um as you can see it's already fairly

124
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
so um as you can see it's already fairly
 

125
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,869
so um as you can see it's already fairly
large number and this is 2015 it's a

126
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
large number and this is 2015 it's a
 

127
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,229
large number and this is 2015 it's a
fairly large number

128
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
fairly large number
 

129
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,430
fairly large number
so just to highlight those numbers

130
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
so just to highlight those numbers
 

131
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,510
so just to highlight those numbers
at the moment the hash rate of bitcoin

132
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
at the moment the hash rate of bitcoin
 

133
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,550
at the moment the hash rate of bitcoin
is in this area here yeah so it's a

134
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
is in this area here yeah so it's a
 

135
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,910
is in this area here yeah so it's a
number one

136
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
number one
 

137
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,190
number one
with 18 zeros behind it

138
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
with 18 zeros behind it
 

139
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,869
with 18 zeros behind it
those are the calculations that these

140
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
those are the calculations that these
 

141
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,229
those are the calculations that these
computers in

142
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
computers in
 

143
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,190
computers in
all together do per second so it's a

144
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
all together do per second so it's a
 

145
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,670
all together do per second so it's a
huge number

146
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
huge number
 

147
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,070
huge number
and uh to look at those machines so this

148
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
and uh to look at those machines so this
 

149
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,990
and uh to look at those machines so this
is for example the latest the best of

150
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
is for example the latest the best of
 

151
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,750
is for example the latest the best of
the best at the moment

152
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
the best at the moment
 

153
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,630
the best at the moment
it's the micro bt watts minor m30s that

154
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
it's the micro bt watts minor m30s that
 

155
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,430
it's the micro bt watts minor m30s that
can do

156
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
can do
 

157
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,229
can do
a 112 tera hashes per second and

158
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
a 112 tera hashes per second and
 

159
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,110
a 112 tera hashes per second and
consumes

160
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
consumes
 

161
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,229
consumes
3 000 what

162
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
3 000 what
 

163
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,190
3 000 what
so quite significant and this is how the

164
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
so quite significant and this is how the
 

165
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,070
so quite significant and this is how the
machine looks like

166
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
machine looks like
 

167
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,149
machine looks like
yeah so it costs four thousand dollars

168
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
yeah so it costs four thousand dollars
 

169
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,750
yeah so it costs four thousand dollars
and these machines look like this here

170
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
and these machines look like this here
 

171
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,550
and these machines look like this here
they make a hell of a noise because

172
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
they make a hell of a noise because
 

173
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,990
they make a hell of a noise because
they run at 100 percent all the time and

174
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
they run at 100 percent all the time and
 

175
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,509
they run at 100 percent all the time and
they consume as you can see 3 000 watts

176
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
they consume as you can see 3 000 watts
 

177
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,710
they consume as you can see 3 000 watts
a lot of electricity so a miner has to

178
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
a lot of electricity so a miner has to
 

179
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,990
a lot of electricity so a miner has to
really calculate

180
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
really calculate
 

181
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,910
really calculate
whether it's worse using these machines

182
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
whether it's worse using these machines
 

183
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,270
whether it's worse using these machines
at a specific electricity rate or not

184
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
at a specific electricity rate or not
 

185
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,390
at a specific electricity rate or not
okay so far so good let's look at

186
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
okay so far so good let's look at
 

187
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,910
okay so far so good let's look at
what that really means so i've done here

188
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
what that really means so i've done here
 

189
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,710
what that really means so i've done here
a little

190
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
a little
 

191
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,190
a little
credit a little table so back in 2009

192
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
credit a little table so back in 2009
 

193
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,990
credit a little table so back in 2009
you saw

194
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
you saw
 

195
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,430
you saw
a human would probably do one

196
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
a human would probably do one
 

197
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,949
a human would probably do one
calculation per second that's very

198
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
calculation per second that's very
 

199
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,630
calculation per second that's very
generous i would say more

200
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
generous i would say more
 

201
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,350
generous i would say more
0.1 because it's not that easy to for a

202
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
0.1 because it's not that easy to for a
 

203
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,350
0.1 because it's not that easy to for a
human brain to do that puzzle

204
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
human brain to do that puzzle
 

205
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,509
human brain to do that puzzle
a cpu is doing between 600 000 or 150

206
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
a cpu is doing between 600 000 or 150
 

207
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,229
a cpu is doing between 600 000 or 150
million

208
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
million
 

209
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,390
million
per per second in average i took two

210
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
per per second in average i took two
 

211
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,589
per per second in average i took two
million the gpo goes up to 20 million

212
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
million the gpo goes up to 20 million
 

213
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,470
million the gpo goes up to 20 million
and here we've got the ac computers yeah

214
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
and here we've got the ac computers yeah
 

215
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,350
and here we've got the ac computers yeah
so 60

216
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
so 60
 

217
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,070
so 60
uh terahash per second that's what they

218
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
uh terahash per second that's what they
 

219
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,270
uh terahash per second that's what they
do

220
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
do
 

221
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,229
do
yeah next step is the current hash rate

222
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
yeah next step is the current hash rate
 

223
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,149
yeah next step is the current hash rate
is 150 exahash

224
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
is 150 exahash
 

225
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,830
is 150 exahash
and that's equivalent to two and a half

226
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
and that's equivalent to two and a half
 

227
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,509
and that's equivalent to two and a half
million ac computers

228
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
million ac computers
 

229
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,990
million ac computers
yeah so in average if you take the

230
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
yeah so in average if you take the
 

231
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,350
yeah so in average if you take the
average number if you take the average

232
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
average number if you take the average
 

233
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,470
average number if you take the average
number you have got two and a half

234
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
number you have got two and a half
 

235
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,149
number you have got two and a half
million computers

236
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
million computers
 

237
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,990
million computers
that are specialized on this subject

238
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
that are specialized on this subject
 

239
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,390
that are specialized on this subject
here securing the bitcoin net

240
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
here securing the bitcoin net
 

241
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,749
here securing the bitcoin net
network and if you take a look at the

242
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
network and if you take a look at the
 

243
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,710
network and if you take a look at the
cost so

244
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
cost so
 

245
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,950
cost so
you saw the latest of the best is three

246
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
you saw the latest of the best is three
 

247
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,629
you saw the latest of the best is three
thousand or four thousand dollars

248
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
thousand or four thousand dollars
 

249
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,230
thousand or four thousand dollars
so i take an average of thousand five

250
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
so i take an average of thousand five
 

251
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,830
so i take an average of thousand five
hundred dollars

252
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
hundred dollars
 

253
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,189
hundred dollars
uh multiplied with 2.5 million

254
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
uh multiplied with 2.5 million
 

255
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,230
uh multiplied with 2.5 million
uh computers uh or asic machines

256
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
uh computers uh or asic machines
 

257
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,670
uh computers uh or asic machines
that is a bill just hardware bill of

258
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:38,680
that is a bill just hardware bill of
 

259
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,550
that is a bill just hardware bill of
3.75 billion

260
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
3.75 billion
 

261
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,150
3.75 billion
uh us dollars to to just

262
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
uh us dollars to to just
 

263
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,350
uh us dollars to to just
take over 50 of the network

264
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
take over 50 of the network
 

265
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,469
take over 50 of the network
so who will do that yeah so that in

266
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
so who will do that yeah so that in
 

267
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,030
so who will do that yeah so that in
itself

268
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
itself
 

269
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,990
itself
is a very difficult thing to achieve

270
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
is a very difficult thing to achieve
 

271
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,749
is a very difficult thing to achieve
assuming that you're able to get those

272
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
assuming that you're able to get those
 

273
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,350
assuming that you're able to get those
machines because they're constantly sold

274
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
machines because they're constantly sold
 

275
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,909
machines because they're constantly sold
out

276
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
out
 

277
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,270
out
so getting two and a half million

278
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
so getting two and a half million
 

279
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,029
so getting two and a half million
computers that

280
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
computers that
 

281
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,749
computers that
are asic machines that are able to do

282
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
are asic machines that are able to do
 

283
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,590
are asic machines that are able to do
these calculations

284
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
these calculations
 

285
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,430
these calculations
for a price of around four billion us

286
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
for a price of around four billion us
 

287
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,590
for a price of around four billion us
dollars i don't think that anybody is

288
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
dollars i don't think that anybody is
 

289
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,070
dollars i don't think that anybody is
capable

290
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
capable
 

291
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,230
capable
of finding that and that's the beauty of

292
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
of finding that and that's the beauty of
 

293
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,670
of finding that and that's the beauty of
the proof-of-work of

294
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
the proof-of-work of
 

295
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,110
the proof-of-work of
bitcoin yeah so um

296
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
bitcoin yeah so um
 

297
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,629
bitcoin yeah so um
in other words the big question is

298
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
in other words the big question is
 

299
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,550
in other words the big question is
if you've got your wealth whatever that

300
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
if you've got your wealth whatever that
 

301
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,790
if you've got your wealth whatever that
is yeah if it's hundred dollars if it's

302
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
is yeah if it's hundred dollars if it's
 

303
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,550
is yeah if it's hundred dollars if it's
10 million dollars whatever if you want

304
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
10 million dollars whatever if you want
 

305
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,629
10 million dollars whatever if you want
to do a transfer from

306
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
to do a transfer from
 

307
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,950
to do a transfer from
your account to a foreign account what

308
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
your account to a foreign account what
 

309
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,469
your account to a foreign account what
would you prefer to use

310
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
would you prefer to use
 

311
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,310
would you prefer to use
would you prefer to use the banking and

312
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
would you prefer to use the banking and
 

313
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,070
would you prefer to use the banking and
the government systems

314
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
the government systems
 

315
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,749
the government systems
where you can be sure that they'll

316
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
where you can be sure that they'll
 

317
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,909
where you can be sure that they'll
charge you a high fee

318
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
charge you a high fee
 

319
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,310
charge you a high fee
and in many cases the money doesn't even

320
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
and in many cases the money doesn't even
 

321
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,390
and in many cases the money doesn't even
arrive on the other end

322
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
arrive on the other end
 

323
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,510
arrive on the other end
because the bank will have some sort of

324
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
because the bank will have some sort of
 

325
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,510
because the bank will have some sort of
problems with the transfer or you're

326
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
problems with the transfer or you're
 

327
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,790
problems with the transfer or you're
doing something

328
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
doing something
 

329
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,629
doing something
where you have got over 2 million

330
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639

computers
 

333
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,749
computers
securing the network that nothing

334
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
securing the network that nothing
 

335
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,629

happens where no humans are involved

336
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
happens where no humans are involved
 

337
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,670
happens where no humans are involved
where the software is open source and

338
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
where the software is open source and
 

339
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,590
where the software is open source and
where other computers which other nodes

340
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
where other computers which other nodes
 

341
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,029
where other computers which other nodes
are constantly checking that everything

342
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
are constantly checking that everything
 

343
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,790

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
consumes a lot of electricity
 

355
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,029
consumes a lot of electricity
yeah but the reason is it's the most

356
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
yeah but the reason is it's the most
 

357
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,390
yeah but the reason is it's the most
secure network in the world

358
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
secure network in the world
 

359
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,150

you will not find anything that is more

360
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
you will not find anything that is more
 

361
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,390
you will not find anything that is more
secure than the bitcoin network

362
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
secure than the bitcoin network
 

363
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,469
secure than the bitcoin network
and that's why also all the software is

364
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
and that's why also all the software is
 

365
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,510
and that's why also all the software is
open source

366
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
open source
 

367
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,189
open source
so that everybody can check what's

368
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
so that everybody can check what's
 

369
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,110
so that everybody can check what's
running on those machines

370
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
running on those machines
 

371
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,230
