directly through
 

231
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,070
directly through
programmable money it will take time to

232
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
programmable money it will take time to
 

233
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,869
programmable money it will take time to
get it to that

234
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
get it to that
 

235
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,670

so how that will look like at the end
 

293
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,909
so how that will look like at the end
nobody knows of course

294
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
nobody knows of course
 

295
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,670
nobody knows of course
but that these people are meeting

296
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
but that these people are meeting

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
well you know all the features of of
 

317
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,350
well you know all the features of of
bitcoin

318
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
bitcoin
 

319
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,710
bitcoin
so um bitcoin is a fantastic alternative

320
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
so um bitcoin is a fantastic alternative
 

321
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,469
so um bitcoin is a fantastic alternative
all the other cryptocurrencies

322

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,590
the major ones are definitely a good
alternative let's see what libra will

326
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
alternative let's see what libra will
 

327
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,629
alternative let's see what libra will
bring up

328
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
bring up
 

329
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,990
