49
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,430
and the red line is the red curve
is the u.s stock exchange

50

the blue is the gold price and so you
 

53
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,229
the blue is the gold price and so you
see there's a significant gap

54
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
see there's a significant gap
 

55
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,310
see there's a significant gap
uh especially since yesterday where we

56
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320

i'd like to spend a few minutes on that
subject

168
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
subject
 

169
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,589
subject
and for that i pulled up a website

170
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
and for that i pulled up a website
 

171
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,990
and for that i pulled up a website
called ian callman.io because this is

172
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
called ian callman.io because this is
 

173
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,509
called ian callman.io because this is
uh uses um

174
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
uh uses um
 

175
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,670
uh uses um
the web the the content fantastically

176
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
the web the the content fantastically
 

177
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,550
the web the the content fantastically
well

178
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
well
 

179
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,509
well
and so there's somebody in bitcoin or

180
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
and so there's somebody in bitcoin or
 

181
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,149
and so there's somebody in bitcoin or
team

182
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
team
 

183
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,949
team
that came up with this process of how to

184
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
that came up with this process of how to
 

185
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,149
that came up with this process of how to
convert

186
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
convert
 

187
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,270
convert
uh a private key into a public key and

188
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
uh a private key into a public key and
 

189
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,589
uh a private key into a public key and
they expanded that and now a lot of

190
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
they expanded that and now a lot of
 

191
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,350
they expanded that and now a lot of
different cryptocurrencies are using the

192
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
different cryptocurrencies are using the
 

193
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,229
different cryptocurrencies are using the
same process

194
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
same process
 

195
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,030
same process
and that's why it's called bip 39 or bip

196
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
and that's why it's called bip 39 or bip
 

197
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,070
and that's why it's called bip 39 or bip
44

198
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
44
 

199
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,270
44
because it's bitcoin improvement

200
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
because it's bitcoin improvement
 

201
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,789
because it's bitcoin improvement
protocol but other

202
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
protocol but other
 

203
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,550
protocol but other
currencies are using that so i just gen

204
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
currencies are using that so i just gen
 

205
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,110
currencies are using that so i just gen
clicked on generated on 24 words

206
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
clicked on generated on 24 words
 

207
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,070
clicked on generated on 24 words
and so out of a repository uh the system

208
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
and so out of a repository uh the system
 

209
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,869
and so out of a repository uh the system
generated 24 words

210
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
generated 24 words
 

211
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,190
generated 24 words
and that those are the words that you

212
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
and that those are the words that you
 

213
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,550
and that those are the words that you
need to remember

214
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
need to remember
 

215
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,190
need to remember
when you generate a wallet for example

216
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
when you generate a wallet for example
 

217
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,830
when you generate a wallet for example
you

218
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
you
 

219
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,030
you
create a new wallet the wallet will uh

220
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
create a new wallet the wallet will uh
 

221
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,670
create a new wallet the wallet will uh
generate those 24 words and those are

222
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
generate those 24 words and those are
 

223
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,869
generate those 24 words and those are
the ones that you have to remember

224
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
the ones that you have to remember
 

225
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,149
the ones that you have to remember
because everything

226
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
because everything
 

227
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,670
because everything
derives from those 24 words so with

228
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
derives from those 24 words so with
 

229
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,509
derives from those 24 words so with
a little bit this little bit technical

230
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
a little bit this little bit technical
 

231
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,149
a little bit this little bit technical
here but from those 24 words

232
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
here but from those 24 words
 

233
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,469
here but from those 24 words
we deduct the private key from that

234
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
we deduct the private key from that
 

235
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,469
we deduct the private key from that
private key we deduct the public key and

236
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
private key we deduct the public key and
 

237
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,310
private key we deduct the public key and
that public key and then generates the

238
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
that public key and then generates the
 

239
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,270
that public key and then generates the
address

240
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
address
 

241
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,990
address
yeah so and the reason that is done is

242
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
yeah so and the reason that is done is
 

243
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,749
yeah so and the reason that is done is
that there is no way in the world that

244
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
that there is no way in the world that
 

245
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,350
that there is no way in the world that
you can get back to the private key

246
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
you can get back to the private key
 

247
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,710
you can get back to the private key
that's why

248
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
that's why
 

249
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,749
that's why
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so

250
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so
 

251
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,430
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so
what you do is you take the private key

252
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
what you do is you take the private key
 

253
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,670
what you do is you take the private key
you hash it that's a special

254
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
you hash it that's a special
 

255
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,870
you hash it that's a special
crypto cryptographic process and with

256
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
crypto cryptographic process and with
 

257
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,870
crypto cryptographic process and with
that you generate the public key

258
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
that you generate the public key
 

259
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,790
that you generate the public key
and the public key is hashed twice and

260
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
and the public key is hashed twice and
 

261
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,310
and the public key is hashed twice and
that generates the address

262
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
that generates the address
 

263
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,469
that generates the address
the reason that this is done is that

264
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
the reason that this is done is that
 

265
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,110
the reason that this is done is that
there might be future some computers

266
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
there might be future some computers
 

267
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,310
there might be future some computers
that are able to deduct from the public

268
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
that are able to deduct from the public
 

269
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,590
that are able to deduct from the public
key the private key

270
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
key the private key
 

271
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,150
key the private key
there it don't exist yet but we're

272
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
there it don't exist yet but we're
 

273
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,790
there it don't exist yet but we're
thinking

274
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
thinking
 

275
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,270
thinking
well ahead in the future and that's why

276
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
well ahead in the future and that's why
 

277
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,110
well ahead in the future and that's why
we are using the address as

278
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
we are using the address as
 

279
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,710
we are using the address as
the key that you send to other people

280
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
the key that you send to other people
 

281
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,029
the key that you send to other people
in case you want to resee some bitcoin

282
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
in case you want to resee some bitcoin
 

283
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,749
in case you want to resee some bitcoin
or so

284
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
or so
 

285
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,430
or so
so this is all the magic behind it

286
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
so this is all the magic behind it
 

287
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,469
so this is all the magic behind it
it's based on those 24 words those 24

288
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
it's based on those 24 words those 24
 

289
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,469
it's based on those 24 words those 24
words generate the private key the

290
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
words generate the private key the
 

291
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,230
words generate the private key the
private key generates the public key

292
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
private key generates the public key
 

293
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,310
private key generates the public key
and the public key generates the address

294
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
and the public key generates the address
 

295
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,310
and the public key generates the address
and address is what we use

296
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
and address is what we use
 

297
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,590
and address is what we use
and that set is used in many other

298
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
and that set is used in many other
 

299
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,189
and that set is used in many other
um ikea uh cryptocurrencies they use the

300
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
um ikea uh cryptocurrencies they use the
 

301
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,469
um ikea uh cryptocurrencies they use the
same

302
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
same
 

303
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,830
