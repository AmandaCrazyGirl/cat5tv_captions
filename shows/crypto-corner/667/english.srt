ethereum 2.0 i'm going to explain to you
 

11
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,110
ethereum 2.0 i'm going to explain to you
in a very simple way

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
in a very simple way

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,830
in a very simple way
what ethereum 2.0 is all about and to

00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
what ethereum 2.0 is all about and to
 

15

what ethereum 2.0 is all about and to
start

we're going to look at the fees so the

18
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
we're going to look at the fees so the
 

19
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,830
we're going to look at the fees so the
fees that you pay

20
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
fees that you pay
 

21
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,189
fees that you pay
when you do a transaction on the

22
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
when you do a transaction on the
 

23
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,109
when you do a transaction on the
ethereum blockchain and this year is

24
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,119
ethereum blockchain and this year is
 

25
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,790
ethereum blockchain and this year is
2018.

26
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:27,800
2018.
 

27
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,310
2018.
2018 the fees were fairly low and then

28
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
2018 the fees were fairly low and then
 

29
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,910
2018 the fees were fairly low and then
suddenly project was started called

30
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
suddenly project was started called
 

31
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,270
suddenly project was started called
cryptokitties

32
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
cryptokitties
 

33
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,190
cryptokitties
everybody complained about it because

34
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
everybody complained about it because
 

35
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,549
everybody complained about it because
the fees went absolutely through the

36
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
the fees went absolutely through the
 

37
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,430
the fees went absolutely through the
roof

38
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
roof
 

39
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,750
roof
now that was 2018 how does that same

40
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
now that was 2018 how does that same
 

41
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,510
now that was 2018 how does that same
picture look today

42
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
picture look today
 

43
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,790
picture look today
if i expand this here to today

44
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
if i expand this here to today
 

45
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,510
if i expand this here to today
then here this is the little blip with

46
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
then here this is the little blip with
 

47
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,430
then here this is the little blip with
cryptokittles the fees

48
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
cryptokittles the fees
 

49
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,590
cryptokittles the fees
that we had to pay because of defy not

50
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
that we had to pay because of defy not
 

51
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,790
that we had to pay because of defy not
so long ago

52
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
so long ago
 

53
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,069
so long ago
were significantly higher and if you

54
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
were significantly higher and if you
 

55
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,150
were significantly higher and if you
consider that we are how many people are

56
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
consider that we are how many people are
 

57
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,670
consider that we are how many people are
we using the ethereum blockchain

58
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
we using the ethereum blockchain
 

59
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,430
we using the ethereum blockchain
let's say a hundred thousand two hundred

60
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
let's say a hundred thousand two hundred
 

61
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,149
let's say a hundred thousand two hundred
thousand it won't be much more than that

62
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
thousand it won't be much more than that
 

63
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,789
thousand it won't be much more than that
so if two hundred thousand can already

64
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
so if two hundred thousand can already
 

65
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,270
so if two hundred thousand can already
um

66
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
um
 

67
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,230
um
bring the blockchain uh in regards to

68
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
bring the blockchain uh in regards to
 

69
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,070
bring the blockchain uh in regards to
fees to a halt

70
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
fees to a halt
 

71
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,750
fees to a halt
how would that look like if we have got

72
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
how would that look like if we have got
 

73
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,910
how would that look like if we have got
certainly 20 million people using this

74
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
certainly 20 million people using this
 

75
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,550
certainly 20 million people using this
chain

76
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
chain
 

77
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,789
chain
it will not be feasible any longer and

78
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
it will not be feasible any longer and
 

79
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,030
it will not be feasible any longer and
that's why

80
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
that's why
 

81
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,870
that's why
including also some other reasons a long

82
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
including also some other reasons a long
 

83
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,070
including also some other reasons a long
time ago the idea of ethereum 2.0 was

84
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
time ago the idea of ethereum 2.0 was
 

85
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,950
time ago the idea of ethereum 2.0 was
started

86
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
started
 

87
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,950
started
and it taking it's it's taking its time

88
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
and it taking it's it's taking its time
 

89
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,469
and it taking it's it's taking its time
and why because

90
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
and why because
 

91
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,630
and why because
coding and programming is not simple

92
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
coding and programming is not simple
 

93
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,230
coding and programming is not simple
yeah if you have got a company like

94
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
yeah if you have got a company like
 

95
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,830
yeah if you have got a company like
apple or google where everything is

96
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
apple or google where everything is
 

97
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,030
apple or google where everything is
under one roof

98
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
under one roof
 

99
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,870
under one roof
everything is coordinated in a different

100
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
everything is coordinated in a different
 

101
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,710
everything is coordinated in a different
way you can have

102
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
way you can have
 

103
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,149
way you can have
a different type of transparency and

104
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
a different type of transparency and
 

105
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,350
a different type of transparency and
and also objectives but if you have got

106
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
and also objectives but if you have got
 

107
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,749
and also objectives but if you have got
a team of 400 people that are

108
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
a team of 400 people that are
 

109
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,990
a team of 400 people that are
coordinated through something like

110
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
coordinated through something like
 

111
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,310
coordinated through something like
github yeah so this github is where

112
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
github yeah so this github is where
 

113
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,469
github yeah so this github is where
everything happens in regards to

114
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
everything happens in regards to
 

115
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,429
everything happens in regards to
ethereum

116
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
ethereum
 

117
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,749
ethereum
then it looks very it's very complex and

118
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
then it looks very it's very complex and
 

119
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,190
then it looks very it's very complex and
so everything has to be done very

120
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
so everything has to be done very
 

121
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,789
so everything has to be done very
meticulously

122
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
meticulously
 

123
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,950
meticulously
because we're talking about money here

124
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
because we're talking about money here
 

125
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,950
because we're talking about money here
in this case

126
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
in this case
 

127
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,270
in this case
money transfer so big mistakes will cost

128
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
money transfer so big mistakes will cost
 

129
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,790
money transfer so big mistakes will cost
a lot of money as we've seen

130
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
a lot of money as we've seen
 

131
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,670
a lot of money as we've seen
in defile and we've got over in the

132
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
in defile and we've got over in the
 

133
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,550
in defile and we've got over in the
ethereum current

134
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
ethereum current
 

135
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,309
ethereum current
blockchain we've got over 244

136
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
blockchain we've got over 244
 

137
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,589
blockchain we've got over 244
repositories

138
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
repositories
 

139
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,710
repositories
over 500 people uh programming

140
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
over 500 people uh programming
 

141
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,550
over 500 people uh programming
so you can imagine how complex this

142
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
so you can imagine how complex this
 

143
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,150
so you can imagine how complex this
whole thing is yeah there are many

144
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
whole thing is yeah there are many
 

145
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,990
whole thing is yeah there are many
hundred thousand lines of code

146
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
hundred thousand lines of code
 

147
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,309
hundred thousand lines of code
that need to be coordinated that's why

148
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
that need to be coordinated that's why
 

149
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,430
that need to be coordinated that's why
this thing takes

150
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
this thing takes
 

151
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,229
this thing takes
so long now looking at the roadmap

152
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
so long now looking at the roadmap
 

153
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,750
so long now looking at the roadmap
this is the roadmap of the

154
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
this is the roadmap of the
 

155
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,430
this is the roadmap of the
of east 2.0 so this is the current chain

156
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
of east 2.0 so this is the current chain
 

157
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,670
of east 2.0 so this is the current chain
here so this is 1.0

158
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
here so this is 1.0
 

159
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,150
here so this is 1.0
that's the ethereum you and i know and

160
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
that's the ethereum you and i know and
 

161
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,910
that's the ethereum you and i know and
soon we will have the beacon chain

162
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
soon we will have the beacon chain
 

163
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,030
soon we will have the beacon chain
which is the start of ethereum 2.0

164
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
which is the start of ethereum 2.0
 

165
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,869
which is the start of ethereum 2.0
and this year is like the current chain

166
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
and this year is like the current chain
 

167
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,190
and this year is like the current chain
without proof of work so proof of stake

168
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
without proof of work so proof of stake
 

169
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,550
without proof of work so proof of stake
and you will not have any smart

170
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
and you will not have any smart
 

171
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,670
and you will not have any smart
contracts in this

172
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
contracts in this
 

173
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,550
contracts in this
uh phase zero from there we will start

174
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
uh phase zero from there we will start
 

175
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,190
uh phase zero from there we will start
with the pha

176
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
with the pha
 

177
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,670
with the pha
with this smart contracts but we'll have

178
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
with this smart contracts but we'll have
 

179
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,589
with this smart contracts but we'll have
shards and charts i like

180
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
shards and charts i like
 

181
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,750
shards and charts i like
just imagine it in a very simple way

182
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
just imagine it in a very simple way
 

183
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,790
just imagine it in a very simple way
like sub

184
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
like sub
 

185
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,350
like sub
block chain so you'll have a chain for

186
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
block chain so you'll have a chain for
 

187
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,869
block chain so you'll have a chain for
let's say

188
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
let's say
 

189
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,190
let's say
d5 you'll have a chain that's that needs

190
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
d5 you'll have a chain that's that needs
 

191
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,190
d5 you'll have a chain that's that needs
to be secured in a special way

192
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
to be secured in a special way
 

193
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,509
to be secured in a special way
then you've got a new chain for uh

194
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
then you've got a new chain for uh
 

195
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,550
then you've got a new chain for uh
gamers

196
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
gamers
 

197
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,869
gamers
so when something happens like with

198
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
so when something happens like with
 

199
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,949
so when something happens like with
cryptokitties where suddenly

200
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
cryptokitties where suddenly
 

201
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,110
cryptokitties where suddenly
the chain was blocked it will be only

202
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
the chain was blocked it will be only
 

203
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,869
the chain was blocked it will be only
that chain that will be blocked at that

204
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
that chain that will be blocked at that
 

205
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,589
that chain that will be blocked at that
time

206
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
time
 

207
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,030
time
and the fees will not go through the

208
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
and the fees will not go through the
 

209
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,710
and the fees will not go through the
roof so there are

210
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
roof so there are
 

211
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,789
roof so there are
lots of little improvements coming also

212
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
lots of little improvements coming also
 

213
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,149
lots of little improvements coming also
along

214
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
along
 

215
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,190
along
uh with this 2.0

216
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
uh with this 2.0
 

217
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,670
uh with this 2.0
and the roadmap in detail this is the

218
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
and the roadmap in detail this is the
 

219
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,190
and the roadmap in detail this is the
one so we here today

220
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
one so we here today
 

221
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,470
one so we here today
and we will start soon phase zero uh

222
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
and we will start soon phase zero uh
 

223
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,670
and we will start soon phase zero uh
phase zero means uh moving away from

224
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
phase zero means uh moving away from
 

225
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,589
phase zero means uh moving away from
proof of work to proof of stake

226
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
proof of work to proof of stake
 

227
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,509
proof of work to proof of stake
and that's done by having a deposit

228
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
and that's done by having a deposit
 

229
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,190
and that's done by having a deposit
contract because you need to secure the

230
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
contract because you need to secure the
 

231
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,589
contract because you need to secure the
network not through miners so people

232
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
network not through miners so people
 

233
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,350
network not through miners so people
that are mining you need to secure it

234
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
that are mining you need to secure it
 

235
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,789
that are mining you need to secure it
through value

236
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
through value
 

237
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,910
through value
and that for that the deposit contract

238
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
and that for that the deposit contract
 

239
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,710
and that for that the deposit contract
was now

240
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
was now
 

241
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,670
was now
created and the time is running now

242
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
created and the time is running now
 

243
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,949
created and the time is running now
until the

244
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
until the
 

245
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,229
until the
7th of december where then the beacon

246
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
7th of december where then the beacon
 

247
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,830
7th of december where then the beacon
chain will be started

248
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
chain will be started
 

249
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,830
chain will be started
from there we will then go over to phase

250
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
from there we will then go over to phase
 

251
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,909
from there we will then go over to phase
zero and then much later phase two

252
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
zero and then much later phase two
 

253
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,629
zero and then much later phase two
and phase three and at this stage you

254
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
and phase three and at this stage you
 

255
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,310
and phase three and at this stage you
there will be also no more proof of work

256
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
there will be also no more proof of work
 

257
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,510
there will be also no more proof of work
so the current

258
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
so the current
 

259
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,270
so the current
blockchain that you know is point zero

260
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
blockchain that you know is point zero
 

261
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,950
blockchain that you know is point zero
will be more or less switched off that's

262
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
will be more or less switched off that's
 

263
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,550
will be more or less switched off that's
not possible i know but

264
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
not possible i know but
 

265
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,550
not possible i know but
it it will not continue everything will

266
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
it it will not continue everything will
 

267
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,909
it it will not continue everything will
happen in the new

268
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
happen in the new
 

269
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,950
happen in the new
uh ethereum 2.0

270
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
uh ethereum 2.0
 

271
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,909
uh ethereum 2.0
and um for the transition from the

272
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
and um for the transition from the
 

273
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,150
and um for the transition from the
current status to the ethernet

274
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
current status to the ethernet
 

275
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,469
current status to the ethernet
phase zero they created a very good

276
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
phase zero they created a very good
 

277
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,510
phase zero they created a very good

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
some questions and so on and they
 

287
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,629
some questions and so on and they
explain to you what that really means

288
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
explain to you what that really means
 

289
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,310
explain to you what that really means
you will get some money so for

290
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
you will get some money so for
 

291
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,150
you will get some money so for
everything that you

292
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
everything that you
 

293
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,710
everything that you
stake so in other words you put up with

294
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
stake so in other words you put up with
 

295
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,830
stake so in other words you put up with
security

296
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
security
 

297
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,189
security
you'll get some money as a reward at the

298
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
you'll get some money as a reward at the
 

299
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,710
you'll get some money as a reward at the
beginning it will be of course higher

300
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
beginning it will be of course higher
 

301
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,390
beginning it will be of course higher
because we're starting

302
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
because we're starting
 

303
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,029
because we're starting
but and over the time it will go down

304
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
but and over the time it will go down
 

305
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,510
but and over the time it will go down
and

306
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
and
 

307
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,230
and
here this is the status of how far

308
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
here this is the status of how far
 

309
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,550
here this is the status of how far
people have committed already to this

310
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
people have committed already to this
 

311
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,830
people have committed already to this
new chain where at ten percent

312
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
new chain where at ten percent
 

313
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,909
new chain where at ten percent
i guess that around the first of

314
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
i guess that around the first of
 

315
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,029
i guess that around the first of
december this thing

316
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039
december this thing
 

317
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,790
december this thing
should be filled more or less because

318
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
should be filled more or less because
 

319
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,270
should be filled more or less because
all the big whales will be coming in

320
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
all the big whales will be coming in
 

321
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,390
all the big whales will be coming in
um into uh staking because they get

322
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
um into uh staking because they get
 

323
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,029
um into uh staking because they get
the rewards are not bad at the beginning

324
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
the rewards are not bad at the beginning
 

325
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,070
the rewards are not bad at the beginning
so

326
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
so
 

327
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,150
so
this is um ethereum 1.0 explained

328
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
this is um ethereum 1.0 explained
 

329
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,189
this is um ethereum 1.0 explained
2.0 sorry explained in a very simple way

330
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
2.0 sorry explained in a very simple way
 

331
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,029
2.0 sorry explained in a very simple way
