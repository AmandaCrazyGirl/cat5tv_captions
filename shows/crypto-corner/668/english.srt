and went
back to 2018 december 2018

102
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
back to 2018 december 2018
 

103
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,510
back to 2018 december 2018
and as you can see this is the bull

104
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
and as you can see this is the bull

market we lived through the last time
yeah so it went

108
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
yeah so it went
 

109
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,429
yeah so it went
up from around eight hundred six hundred

110
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
up from around eight hundred six hundred
 

111

dollars to twenty thousand dollars
 

113
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,630
dollars to twenty thousand dollars
in the all-time high was at that time

114
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
in the all-time high was at that time
 

115
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,630
in the all-time high was at that time
around the nineteen thousand six hundred

116
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
around the nineteen thousand six hundred
 

117
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,109
around the nineteen thousand six hundred
sixty five dollars

118
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
sixty five dollars
 

119
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,589
sixty five dollars
and if we look into the numbers so this

120
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
and if we look into the numbers so this
 

121
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,270
and if we look into the numbers so this
is the number so this is going market

122
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
is the number so this is going market
 

123
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,150
is the number so this is going market

um they did a historical snapshot 10th

126
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
um they did a historical snapshot 10th
 

127
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,630
um they did a historical snapshot 10th
of december 2017.

128
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
of december 2017.

bitcoin went up in seven days 34

130
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
bitcoin went up in seven days 34
 

131
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,430
bitcoin went up in seven days 34
most of the other coins as you can see

132
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
most of the other coins as you can see
 

133
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,070
most of the other coins as you can see
are in red so they went down

134
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
are in red so they went down
 

135
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,790
are in red so they went down
so there was no correlation at that time

136
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
so there was no correlation at that time
 

137
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,309
so there was no correlation at that time
that significant between

138
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
that significant between
 

139
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,550
that significant between

and uh what i find encouraging at the
 

219
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,149
and uh what i find encouraging at the
moment is that this bull market

220
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
moment is that this bull market
 

221
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,070
moment is that this bull market
that we're currently living through i

222
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
that we're currently living through i

after the bull market will come a true
 

227
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,869
after the bull market will come a true

228
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
retracement and in cryptocurrencies that
 

229
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,710
retracement and in cryptocurrencies that
will be around 20 to 30 percent

230
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
will be around 20 to 30 percent
 

231
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,229

encouraging is
if you look at google trends so people

236
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
if you look at google trends so people
 

237
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,270
if you look at google trends so people
that are searching for the word

that are searching for the word
 

239
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,550
that are searching for the word
bitcoin for example on a global basis

240
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
bitcoin for example on a global basis
 

241
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,429
bitcoin for example on a global basis
in 2018 that was 100 equivalent to 100

242
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
in 2018 that was 100 equivalent to 100
 

243
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,390
in 2018 that was 100 equivalent to 100
percent

244
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
percent
 

245
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,670
percent
at the moment we're only at 11 10 11

246
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
at the moment we're only at 11 10 11
 

247
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,830
at the moment we're only at 11 10 11
so not a lot of people outside of our

248
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
so not a lot of people outside of our

crocodile teeth where it went up by
50 and down by 20 in in in a week

306
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
50 and down by 20 in in in a week
 

307
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,350
50 and down by 20 in in in a week
and then we had um and i i also both

308
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
and then we had um and i i also both
 

309
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,110
and then we had um and i i also both
times i was not able to read the top

310
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
times i was not able to read the top
 

311
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,150
times i was not able to read the top
market so i

312
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
market so i
 

313
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,230
market so i
miscalculated that one too as i guess

314
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
miscalculated that one too as i guess
 

315
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,670
miscalculated that one too as i guess
most of the people

316
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
most of the people
 

317
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,670
most of the people
