00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,040
today i've got two things for you
 

9
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,790
today i've got two things for you
first the first one is linked to the

10
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
first the first one is linked to the
 

11
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,470
first the first one is linked to the
travel rule which says

12
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
travel rule which says
 

13
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,950
travel rule which says
that when you've got coins on one

14
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
that when you've got coins on one
 

15
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,470
that when you've got coins on one
exchange and you transfer them over to

16
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
exchange and you transfer them over to
 

17
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,590
exchange and you transfer them over to
another exchange

18
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
another exchange
 

19
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,390
another exchange
the first exchange has to also transmit

20
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
the first exchange has to also transmit
 

21
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,510
the first exchange has to also transmit
the kyc

22
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
the kyc
 

23
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,750
the kyc
data so know your customers so your

24
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
data so know your customers so your
 

25
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,910
data so know your customers so your
street address passport picture

26
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
street address passport picture
 

27
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,269
street address passport picture
and so on to the other exchange um

28
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
and so on to the other exchange um
 

29
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,189
and so on to the other exchange um
that looks like it's a law that will

30
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
that looks like it's a law that will
 

31
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,670
that looks like it's a law that will
come on an international basis

32
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
come on an international basis
 

33
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,510
come on an international basis
and that also means that if you want to

34
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
and that also means that if you want to
 

35
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,709
and that also means that if you want to
transfer those coins

36
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
transfer those coins
 

37
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,470
transfer those coins
out of the exchange onto your private

38
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
out of the exchange onto your private
 

39
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,830
out of the exchange onto your private
wallet this exchange has to do kyc

40
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
wallet this exchange has to do kyc
 

41
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,910
wallet this exchange has to do kyc
on your private wallet so you have to

42
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
on your private wallet so you have to
 

43
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,830
on your private wallet so you have to
prove that that private wallet is really

44
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
prove that that private wallet is really
 

45
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,790
prove that that private wallet is really
yours

46
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
yours
 

47
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,630
yours
how are they going to do that don't know

48
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
how are they going to do that don't know
 

49
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,709
how are they going to do that don't know
yet but it looks like that's going to

50
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
yet but it looks like that's going to
 

51
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,110
yet but it looks like that's going to
happen

52
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
happen
 

53
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,069
happen
it's a law that might happen in the u.s

54
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
it's a law that might happen in the u.s
 

55
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,670
it's a law that might happen in the u.s
and if it's happening here in the us it

56
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
and if it's happening here in the us it
 

57
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,110
and if it's happening here in the us it
will happen everywhere

58
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
will happen everywhere
 

59
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,110
will happen everywhere
so my recommendation at this stage is

60
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
so my recommendation at this stage is
 

61
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,110
so my recommendation at this stage is
take your coins and get them off the

62
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
take your coins and get them off the
 

63
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,349
take your coins and get them off the
exchange asap into your hardware wallet

64
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
exchange asap into your hardware wallet
 

65
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,830
exchange asap into your hardware wallet
or any other wallet that you have

66
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
or any other wallet that you have
 

67
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,550
or any other wallet that you have
because i don't know when this law might

68
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
because i don't know when this law might
 

69
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,350
because i don't know when this law might
or

70
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
or
 

71
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,550
or
come into into place the other thing

people doing an analysis on those charts
 

91
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,429
people doing an analysis on those charts
yeah they they pull out the candles and

92
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
yeah they they pull out the candles and
 

93
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,429
yeah they they pull out the candles and
then they say this is a bull flag

94
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
then they say this is a bull flag
 

95
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,429
then they say this is a bull flag
or head and shoulders or inverse i don't

know what
and there are two camps the first camp

100
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
and there are two camps the first camp
 

101
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,830
and there are two camps the first camp
says

102
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
says
 

103
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,590
says
this can't be true i mean that might be

104
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
this can't be true i mean that might be
 

105
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,429
this can't be true i mean that might be
true on the large caps like

106
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
true on the large caps like
 

107
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,990
true on the large caps like
apple uh real stocks but in

108
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
apple uh real stocks but in
 

109
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,910
apple uh real stocks but in
cryptocurrencies they do anyway what

110
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
cryptocurrencies they do anyway what
 

111
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,710
cryptocurrencies they do anyway what
they want

112
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
they want
 

113
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,550
they want
and it's an international thing so it's

114
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
and it's an international thing so it's
 

115
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,149
and it's an international thing so it's
not linked to a country like

116
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
not linked to a country like
 

117
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,109
not linked to a country like
like let's say apple shares this uh

118
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
like let's say apple shares this uh
 

119
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,709
like let's say apple shares this uh
cryptocurrency is linked to

120
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
cryptocurrency is linked to
 

121
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,990
cryptocurrency is linked to
many countries so why should a

122
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
many countries so why should a
 

123
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,109
many countries so why should a
trend be visible

124
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
trend be visible
 

125
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,910
trend be visible
in the chart the other one is saying

126
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
in the chart the other one is saying
 

127
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,550
in the chart the other one is saying
hold on

128
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
hold on
 

129
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,670
hold on
that might be right for ex for stocks

130
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
that might be right for ex for stocks
 

131
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,190
that might be right for ex for stocks
like here this is the apple stock where

132
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
like here this is the apple stock where
 

133
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,869
like here this is the apple stock where
you can do an analysis

134
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
you can do an analysis
 

135
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,670
you can do an analysis
and more or less fairly accurately not

136
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
and more or less fairly accurately not
 

137
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,030
and more or less fairly accurately not
accurately but you can't predict

138
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
accurately but you can't predict
 

139
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,869
accurately but you can't predict
which trend the the share is going um

140
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
which trend the the share is going um
 

141
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,750
which trend the the share is going um
and also a little bit in regards to

142
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
and also a little bit in regards to
 

143
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,270
and also a little bit in regards to
cryptos because all those

144
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
cryptos because all those
 

145
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,470
cryptos because all those
traders that are coming into our area um

146
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
traders that are coming into our area um
 

147
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,750
traders that are coming into our area um
they're coming from the traditional

148
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
they're coming from the traditional
 

149
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,670
they're coming from the traditional
market they're accustomed to these chart

150
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
market they're accustomed to these chart
 

151
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,630
market they're accustomed to these chart
analysis

152
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
analysis
 

153
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,309
analysis
and therefore they will also apply them

154
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
and therefore they will also apply them
 

155
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,309
and therefore they will also apply them
here so if they apply them here

156
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
here so if they apply them here
 

157
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,589
here so if they apply them here
that means that they will be somehow

158
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
that means that they will be somehow
 

159
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,550
that means that they will be somehow
applicable to what we're doing too

160
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
applicable to what we're doing too
 

161
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,790
applicable to what we're doing too
but there's another thing that is really

162
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
but there's another thing that is really
 

163
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,830
but there's another thing that is really
interesting

164
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
interesting
 

165
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,869
interesting
in regards to um to

166
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
