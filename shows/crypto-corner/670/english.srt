35
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,630
the last four or five months seven days
then we've got here deforest token that

36
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
then we've got here deforest token that
 

37
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,229
then we've got here deforest token that
increased by 119

38
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
increased by 119
 

39
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,709

on the other hand the irs also knows
 

93
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,630
on the other hand the irs also knows
through companies like coinbase

94
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
through companies like coinbase

the worst case you enter the data

144
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
the worst case you enter the data
 

145
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,589
the worst case you enter the data
manually but that is a real

manually but that is a real
 

147
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,390
manually but that is a real
long process once you've got the data in

148
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
long process once you've got the data in
 

149
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,910
long process once you've got the data in
here you've got a fantastic

150
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
here you've got a fantastic

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,030
you lost money on those coins
and more importantly for what we're

156
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
and more importantly for what we're
