basically three
the first one is bitcoin which is the

78
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
the first one is bitcoin which is the
 

79

old the grand ad
 

81

old the grand ad
that's the most stable one that's the

82
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
that's the most stable one that's the
 

83
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,469
that's the most stable one that's the
one that just went

84
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
one that just went
 

85
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,149
one that just went
well above all-time high and you cannot

86
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
well above all-time high and you cannot
 

87
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:40,630
well above all-time high and you cannot
make

88
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
make
 

89
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,990
make
big mistakes there so the fluctuations

90
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
big mistakes there so the fluctuations
 

91
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,630
big mistakes there so the fluctuations
of course

92
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
of course
 

93
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,030
of course
will exist there and as you can see

94
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
will exist there and as you can see
 

95
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,190
will exist there and as you can see
currently we've got a dip of 25

96
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
currently we've got a dip of 25
 

97
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,469
currently we've got a dip of 25
which is absolutely normal in this

98
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
which is absolutely normal in this
 

99
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,870
which is absolutely normal in this
market but you will not have those

100
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
market but you will not have those
 

101
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,990
market but you will not have those
10x or 100x that you might

102
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
10x or 100x that you might
 

103
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,230
10x or 100x that you might
have heard of the next level is ethereum

104
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
have heard of the next level is ethereum
 

105
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,190
have heard of the next level is ethereum
and then the rest falls into the third

106
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
and then the rest falls into the third
 

107
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,190
and then the rest falls into the third
category so i as a beginner

108
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
category so i as a beginner
 

109
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,190
category so i as a beginner
never get involved in a third category

110
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
never get involved in a third category
 

111
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,869
never get involved in a third category
because you have to learn first how this

that
you have to do some research and the

140
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
you have to do some research and the
 

141
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,350
you have to do some research and the
research is also very simple much

142
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
research is also very simple much
 

143
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,390
research is also very simple much
simpler than

on celsius was 6.82 on the
 

213
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,630
on celsius was 6.82 on the
third of january uh 2000 was eight days

214
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
third of january uh 2000 was eight days

219
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,869
is beginning of to the end of 2018
so about two years ago that was the

220
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
so about two years ago that was the
 

221
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,390

223
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,390
all-time low
which is interesting to know that so you

224
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
which is interesting to know that so you
 

225
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,710
which is interesting to know that so you
know if there is a big potential

226
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
know if there is a big potential
 

227
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,070
know if there is a big potential
uh in regards to the price then here

228
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
uh in regards to the price then here
 

229
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,470
uh in regards to the price then here
a little bit further up you've got the

230
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
a little bit further up you've got the
 

231
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,670
a little bit further up you've got the
markets

232
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
markets
 

233
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,190
markets
and the markets just tell you where you

234
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
and the markets just tell you where you
 

235
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,430
and the markets just tell you where you
can buy those and this is also important

236
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
can buy those and this is also important
 

237
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,110
can buy those and this is also important
so for example you've got uniswap here

238
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
so for example you've got uniswap here
 

239
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,069
so for example you've got uniswap here
you can go

240
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
you can go
 

241
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,990
you can go
of course directly to unit swap and buy

242
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
of course directly to unit swap and buy
 

243
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,110
of course directly to unit swap and buy
it there

244
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
it there
 

245
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,310
it there
you run risk that you fall into a hoax

246
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
you run risk that you fall into a hoax
 

247
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,749
you run risk that you fall into a hoax
because not everybody uh i mean you can

248
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
because not everybody uh i mean you can
 

249
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,590
because not everybody uh i mean you can
launch a celsius network token on

250
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
launch a celsius network token on
 

251
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,909
launch a celsius network token on
on unit swap so the best way is to get

252
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
on unit swap so the best way is to get
 

253
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,070
on unit swap so the best way is to get
to coingecko you click on this

254
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
to coingecko you click on this
 

255
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,030
to coingecko you click on this
field here that will redirect you to

256
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
field here that will redirect you to
 

257
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,670
field here that will redirect you to
uniswap and then you can then exchange

258
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
uniswap and then you can then exchange
 

259
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,790
uniswap and then you can then exchange
your ethereum for example against

260
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
your ethereum for example against
 

261
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,670
your ethereum for example against
celsius tokens so that's one way the

262
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
celsius tokens so that's one way the
 

263
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,790
celsius tokens so that's one way the
markets

264
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
markets
 

265
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,150

329
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,270
the product appeal to you
then the users how many users are there

330
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
then the users how many users are there
 

331
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,469
then the users how many users are there
is this a coin

332
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
is this a coin
 

333
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,629
is this a coin
that only a few users are interested in

334
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
that only a few users are interested in
 

335
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,990
that only a few users are interested in
then i would be careful because

336
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
then i would be careful because
 

337
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,670
then i would be careful because
you know that if there are not many

338
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
you know that if there are not many
 

339
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,270
you know that if there are not many
people involved then

340
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
people involved then
 

341
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,230
people involved then
it's unlikely that this thing will go uh

342
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
it's unlikely that this thing will go uh
 

343
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,150
it's unlikely that this thing will go uh
10x 100x or whatever

344
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
10x 100x or whatever
 

345
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,150
10x 100x or whatever
and then the utility of the coin yeah so

346
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
and then the utility of the coin yeah so
 

347
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,830
and then the utility of the coin yeah so
you can what can you do with it is there

348
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
you can what can you do with it is there
 

349
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,070
you can what can you do with it is there
already an example the sample

350
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
already an example the sample
 

351
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,990
already an example the sample
so this is different to the traditional

352
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
so this is different to the traditional
 

353
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,670
so this is different to the traditional
market because the traditional market is

354
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
market because the traditional market is
 

355
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,950
market because the traditional market is
always around

356
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
always around
 

357
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,070
always around
the valuation of the company management

358
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
the valuation of the company management
 

359
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,629
the valuation of the company management
and also key figures of the company

360
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
and also key figures of the company
 

361
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,189
and also key figures of the company
yeah and you buy a share in the company

362
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
yeah and you buy a share in the company
 

363
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,909
yeah and you buy a share in the company
that's

364
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
that's
 

365
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,830
that's
completely different in this market here

366
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
completely different in this market here
 

367
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,909
completely different in this market here
this market is built on hype

368
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
this market is built on hype
 

369
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,029
this market is built on hype
uh we're currently in a bubble uh yes it

370
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
uh we're currently in a bubble uh yes it
 

371
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,749
uh we're currently in a bubble uh yes it
is a bubble

372
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
is a bubble
 

373
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,670
is a bubble
and it will burst at one day like they

374
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
and it will burst at one day like they
 

375
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,670
and it will burst at one day like they
always do in the crypto market

376
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
always do in the crypto market
 

377
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,950
always do in the crypto market
and so you only work towards this bubble

378
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
and so you only work towards this bubble
 

379
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,350
and so you only work towards this bubble
yeah and once this bubble burst the

380
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
yeah and once this bubble burst the
 

381
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,950
yeah and once this bubble burst the
equation is a different one

382
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
equation is a different one
 

383
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,909
equation is a different one
you have to change your mind shift uh at

384
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
you have to change your mind shift uh at
 

385
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,469
you have to change your mind shift uh at
that

386
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
that
 

387
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,589
that
stage when will that be nobody knows but

388
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
stage when will that be nobody knows but
 

389
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,309
stage when will that be nobody knows but
until then

390
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
