00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
now last session last week
 

41
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,389
now last session last week
we spoke about and i showed you how to

42
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
we spoke about and i showed you how to
 

43
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,990
we spoke about and i showed you how to
do your research

44
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
do your research
 

45
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,990
do your research
um that's part of very very important

46
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
um that's part of very very important
 

47
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,430
um that's part of very very important
part of the strategy knowing where to

48
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
part of the strategy knowing where to
 

49
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,470
part of the strategy knowing where to
invest but

50
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
invest but
 

51
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,189
invest but
there's also something else in this

52
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
there's also something else in this
 

53
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,069
there's also something else in this
market

54
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
market
 

55
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,350
market
the crypto market exists of many

56
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
the crypto market exists of many
 

57
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,150
the crypto market exists of many
small bubbles and big bubbles the last

58
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
small bubbles and big bubbles the last
 

59
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,709
small bubbles and big bubbles the last
big bottle we had in 2017

60
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
big bottle we had in 2017
 

61
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,750
big bottle we had in 2017
after that the market collapsed by 80 90

62
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
after that the market collapsed by 80 90
 

63
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,950
after that the market collapsed by 80 90
percent

64
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
percent
 

65
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,149
percent
and in between we have got small bubbles

66
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
and in between we have got small bubbles
 

67
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,590
and in between we have got small bubbles
that also have an effect on the strategy

68
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
that also have an effect on the strategy
 

69
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,630
that also have an effect on the strategy
so let's look into that

70
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
so let's look into that
 

71
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,190
so let's look into that
this is ethereum us dollar and i

72
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
this is ethereum us dollar and i
 

73
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,390
this is ethereum us dollar and i
deliberately went back

74
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
deliberately went back
 

75
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,630
deliberately went back
a few years so this is 2017 as you can

76
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
a few years so this is 2017 as you can
 

77
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,149
a few years so this is 2017 as you can
see the price went up

78
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
see the price went up
 

79
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,590
see the price went up
from 10 up to

80
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
from 10 up to
 

81
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,190
from 10 up to
395 pretty steep increase

82
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
395 pretty steep increase
 

83
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,630
395 pretty steep increase
and then it went down to uh 148 so let's

84
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
and then it went down to uh 148 so let's
 

85
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,749
and then it went down to uh 148 so let's
take a look at that

86
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
take a look at that
 

87
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,069
take a look at that
that is a drop of

88
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
that is a drop of
 

89
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,429
that is a drop of
yeah around 60 percent

90
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
yeah around 60 percent
 

91
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,550
yeah around 60 percent
so that's typical of this market and now

92
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
so that's typical of this market and now
 

93
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,550
so that's typical of this market and now
will it be again 60 maybe i don't know

94
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
will it be again 60 maybe i don't know
 

95
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,950
will it be again 60 maybe i don't know
but it will exist i mean these big drops

96
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
but it will exist i mean these big drops
 

97
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,950
but it will exist i mean these big drops
are absolutely fundamental and important

98
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
are absolutely fundamental and important
 

99
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,389
are absolutely fundamental and important
to the crypto market

100
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
to the crypto market
 

101
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,230
to the crypto market
because um as you'll see um

102
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
because um as you'll see um
 

103
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,310
because um as you'll see um
things evolved from there yeah so if i

104
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
things evolved from there yeah so if i
 

105
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,670
things evolved from there yeah so if i
go further

106
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
go further
 

107
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,710
go further
into 2000 2017

108
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
into 2000 2017
 

109
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,790
into 2000 2017
you see that's where the bull market

110
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
you see that's where the bull market
 

111
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,070
you see that's where the bull market
started yeah so

112
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
started yeah so
 

113
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,190
started yeah so
here was the 395 then the big dip

114
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
here was the 395 then the big dip
 

115
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,949
here was the 395 then the big dip
of 660 percent it went up to 393 so

116
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
of 660 percent it went up to 393 so
 

117
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,070
of 660 percent it went up to 393 so
within one month

118
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
within one month
 

119
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,470
within one month
down 60 percent then up sixty percent

120
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
down 60 percent then up sixty percent
 

121
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,670
down 60 percent then up sixty percent
then it down again

122
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
then it down again
 

123
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,589
then it down again
and then suddenly went up to three

124
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
and then suddenly went up to three
 

125
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,510
and then suddenly went up to three
thousand three hundred seventy seven

126
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
thousand three hundred seventy seven
 

127
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,550
thousand three hundred seventy seven
all this year within six months so when

128
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
all this year within six months so when
 

129
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,390
all this year within six months so when
you're investing in the crypto market

130
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
you're investing in the crypto market
 

131
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,390
you're investing in the crypto market
this is something you need to take into

132
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
this is something you need to take into
 

133
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,750
this is something you need to take into
consideration

134
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
consideration
 

135
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,990
consideration
yeah so the the big ups and the big

136
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
yeah so the the big ups and the big
 

137
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,949
yeah so the the big ups and the big
downs uh

138
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
downs uh
 

139
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,350
downs uh
part of this market they are currently

140
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
part of this market they are currently
 

141
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,309
part of this market they are currently
big part of it you see some coins tokens

142
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
big part of it you see some coins tokens
 

143
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,509
big part of it you see some coins tokens
increasing by 100 a day others

144
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
increasing by 100 a day others
 

145
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,550
increasing by 100 a day others
decreasing by

146
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
decreasing by
 

147
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,630
decreasing by
that same amount another 100 of course

148
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
that same amount another 100 of course
 

149
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,710
that same amount another 100 of course
by by 50 40

150
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
by by 50 40
 

151
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,830
by by 50 40
decreasing so um yeah take that into

152
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
decreasing so um yeah take that into
 

153
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,710
decreasing so um yeah take that into
consideration

154
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
consideration
 

155
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,270
consideration
now what can you do nobody in the world

156
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
now what can you do nobody in the world
 

157
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,390
now what can you do nobody in the world
is capable of

158
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
is capable of
 

159
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,030
is capable of
finding the peak yeah that's absolutely

160
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
finding the peak yeah that's absolutely
 

161
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,949
finding the peak yeah that's absolutely
impossible to do that

162
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
impossible to do that
 

163
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,190
impossible to do that
it's a very dynamic market so it's not

164
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
it's a very dynamic market so it's not
 

165
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,030
it's a very dynamic market so it's not
possible to find the peak

166
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
possible to find the peak
 

167
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,910
possible to find the peak
and so the recommendation i hear always

168
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
and so the recommendation i hear always
 

169
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,309
and so the recommendation i hear always
is

170
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
is
 

171
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,550
is
dollar cost average in other words take

172
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
dollar cost average in other words take
 

173
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,030
dollar cost average in other words take
profits by going in but also by going

174
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
profits by going in but also by going
 

175
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,350
profits by going in but also by going
out

176
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
out
 

177
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,229
out
yeah another what i meant by that is if

178
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
yeah another what i meant by that is if
 

179
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,270
yeah another what i meant by that is if
you're starting to invest in

180
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
you're starting to invest in
 

181
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,869
you're starting to invest in
cryptocurrencies

182
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
cryptocurrencies
 

183
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,190
cryptocurrencies
then um let's say you've got a budget of

184
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
then um let's say you've got a budget of
 

185
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,589
then um let's say you've got a budget of
thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars

186
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars
 

187
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,630
thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars
then every month or every week you buy

188
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
then every month or every week you buy
 

189
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,149
then every month or every week you buy
four thousand dollars

190
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
four thousand dollars
 

191
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,149
four thousand dollars
until you consume the ten thousand

192
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
until you consume the ten thousand
 

193
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,990
until you consume the ten thousand
that's the best strategy

194
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
that's the best strategy
 

195
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,430
that's the best strategy
uh i hear to so you can

196
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
uh i hear to so you can
 

197
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,229
uh i hear to so you can
invest in in cryptocurrencies the same

198
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
invest in in cryptocurrencies the same
 

199
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,830
invest in in cryptocurrencies the same
thing is it's very important that you

200
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
thing is it's very important that you
 

201
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,869
thing is it's very important that you
take profits

202
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
take profits
 

203
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,190
take profits
yes every time when you feel that the

204
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
yes every time when you feel that the
 

205
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,550
yes every time when you feel that the
peak is near

206
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
peak is near
 

207
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,229
peak is near
that's your own feeling nobody can

208
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
that's your own feeling nobody can
 

209
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,070
that's your own feeling nobody can
really help you there then you just take

210
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
really help you there then you just take
 

211
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,030
really help you there then you just take
out profits

212
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
out profits
 

213
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,070
out profits
um the higher you go this goes the more

214
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
um the higher you go this goes the more
 

215
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,869
um the higher you go this goes the more
likely

216
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
likely
 

217
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,550
likely
it is that the big dip will come so

218
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
it is that the big dip will come so
 

219
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,030
it is that the big dip will come so
along the way take profits but very

220
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
along the way take profits but very
 

221
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,070
along the way take profits but very
important

222
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
important
 

223
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,750
important
if you miss this stop here which you

224
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
if you miss this stop here which you
 

225
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,149
if you miss this stop here which you
will of course everybody does

226
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
will of course everybody does
 

227
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,750
will of course everybody does
and then on the way down you take also

228
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
and then on the way down you take also
 

229
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,429
and then on the way down you take also
profits and if this thing my strategy is

230
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
profits and if this thing my strategy is
 

231
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,789
profits and if this thing my strategy is
if this thing dips by 50 then i will

232
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
if this thing dips by 50 then i will
 

233
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,150
if this thing dips by 50 then i will
take out the whole amount

234
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
take out the whole amount
 

235
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,390
take out the whole amount
um because then something bigger is

236
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
um because then something bigger is
 

237
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,749
um because then something bigger is
going to happen but that's only in

238
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
going to happen but that's only in
