there's<00:02:23.860><c> no</c><00:02:24.070><c> files</c><00:02:24.400><c> okay</c><00:02:25.000><c> so</c><00:02:25.060><c> how</c><00:02:25.480><c> do</c><00:02:25.540><c> you</c><00:02:25.900><c> scan</c>

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 align:start position:0%
there's no files okay so how do you scan
 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.010 align:start position:0%

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:40.660 align:start position:0%
biggest example is credit card company
 

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.810 align:start position:0%
biggest example is credit card company
so<00:12:41.230><c> you</c><00:12:41.290><c> have</c><00:12:41.650><c> your</c><00:12:41.860><c> credit</c><00:12:42.010><c> card</c><00:12:42.280><c> in</c><00:12:42.370><c> Canada</c>

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:42.820 align:start position:0%
so you have your credit card in Canada

and we can't flag that as a potential

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:42.310 align:start position:0%
look at it interesting and we can do
 

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.610 align:start position:0%
look at it interesting and we can do
