between the Canadian territory so a very
 

29
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,380
between the Canadian territory so a very
technical mind you very familiar with

30
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:40,390
technical mind you very familiar with
 

31
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,329
technical mind you very familiar with
the inner workings of the products yep I

32
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:42,339
the inner workings of the products yep I
 

33
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,430
the inner workings of the products yep I
am doing that has all the geeky talk

34
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:44,440
am doing that has all the geeky talk
 

35
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,079
am doing that has all the geeky talk
with the other texts and I reflect

36
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,089
with the other texts and I reflect
 

37
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:49,020
with the other texts and I reflect
customers yeah and the main driver for

38
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,030
customers yeah and the main driver for
 

39
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,060
customers yeah and the main driver for
that is to be able to technically

40
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,070
that is to be able to technically
 

41
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,009
that is to be able to technically
position the products and see if we can

42
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,019
position the products and see if we can
 

43
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,570
position the products and see if we can
address all the customer requirements

44
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:54,580
address all the customer requirements
 

45
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,200
address all the customer requirements
sure so part of that comes from

46
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,210
sure so part of that comes from
 

47
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,960
sure so part of that comes from
educating and users to understand what

48
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:00,970
educating and users to understand what
 

49
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,820
educating and users to understand what
the cybersecurity threat landscape looks

50
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:02,830
the cybersecurity threat landscape looks
 

51
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,829
the cybersecurity threat landscape looks
like absolutely yeah and we've really

52
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:04,839
like absolutely yeah and we've really
 

53
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,000
like absolutely yeah and we've really
really seen that change over the past

54
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,010
really seen that change over the past
 

55
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,100
really seen that change over the past
couple of years I think especially was

56
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,110
couple of years I think especially was
 

57
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,300
couple of years I think especially was
it 2017 when wanna cry dropped yes this

58
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,310
it 2017 when wanna cry dropped yes this
 

59
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,520
it 2017 when wanna cry dropped yes this
is like the first ransomware

60
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,530
is like the first ransomware
 

61
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,380
is like the first ransomware
that really made its way around the

62
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,390
that really made its way around the
 

63
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,050
that really made its way around the
world and was really really huge how did

64
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,060
world and was really really huge how did
 

65
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,899
world and was really really huge how did
that impact the direction of a kind like

66
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:21,909
that impact the direction of a kind like
 

67
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,170
that impact the direction of a kind like
you said we should not see any any

68
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,180
you said we should not see any any
 

69
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,700
you said we should not see any any
numbers going down whenever it comes to

70
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:26,710
numbers going down whenever it comes to
 

71
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,740
numbers going down whenever it comes to
the ransomware it's still the the really

72
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,750
the ransomware it's still the the really
 

73
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,770
the ransomware it's still the the really
prevalent and we're and and everybody in

74
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:31,780
prevalent and we're and and everybody in
 

75
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,830
prevalent and we're and and everybody in
a way is kind of experiencing it we do

76
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,840
a way is kind of experiencing it we do
 

77
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,050
a way is kind of experiencing it we do
have a pretty good protection against it

78
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,060
have a pretty good protection against it
 

79
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,469
have a pretty good protection against it
so I I don't expect my existing

80
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
so I I don't expect my existing
 

81
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,940
so I I don't expect my existing
customers that are running updated

82
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:41,950
customers that are running updated
 

83
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,980
customers that are running updated
products and everything from being

84
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:43,990
products and everything from being
 

85
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,740
products and everything from being
active to those threats but it's

86
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:46,750
active to those threats but it's
 

87
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,709
active to those threats but it's
something that's already very very live

88
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:49,719
something that's already very very live
 

89
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,840
something that's already very very live
very very present in our day-to-day

90
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:51,850
very very present in our day-to-day
 

91
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,109
very very present in our day-to-day
operations something else that I that I

92
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
operations something else that I that I
 

93
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,810
operations something else that I that I
usually highlight on the on the threat

94
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:57,820
usually highlight on the on the threat
 

95
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,510
usually highlight on the on the threat
landscape that we have recently is the

96
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:00,520
landscape that we have recently is the
 

97
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,020
landscape that we have recently is the
upcoming releases of the file as malware

98
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,030
upcoming releases of the file as malware
 

99
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,679
upcoming releases of the file as malware
so if you have for example an endpoint

100
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:07,689
so if you have for example an endpoint
 

101
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,230
so if you have for example an endpoint
security product that's running on your

102
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,240
security product that's running on your
 

103
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,470
security product that's running on your
computer and AV anti-malware or

104
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
computer and AV anti-malware or
 

105
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,030
computer and AV anti-malware or
whichever name you prefer to call it

106
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
whichever name you prefer to call it
 

107
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,980
whichever name you prefer to call it
yeah I still have the need to scan files

108
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:19,990
yeah I still have the need to scan files
 

109
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,370
yeah I still have the need to scan files
so however the idea of a file as malware

110
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,380
so however the idea of a file as malware
 

111
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,280
so however the idea of a file as malware
there's no files okay so how do you scan

112
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,290
there's no files okay so how do you scan
 

113
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,010
there's no files okay so how do you scan
something if it's it's not available in

114
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,020
something if it's it's not available in
 

115
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,860
something if it's it's not available in
a computer so those those malware's are

116
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:31,870
a computer so those those malware's are
 

117
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,650
a computer so those those malware's are
in general being running by script on

118
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:34,660
in general being running by script on
 

119
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,380
in general being running by script on
draw webpages malicious web pages right

120
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,390
draw webpages malicious web pages right
 

121
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,380
draw webpages malicious web pages right
and the most common one today is

122
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,390
and the most common one today is
 

123
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,840
and the most common one today is
probably the quaint miners so it's a

124
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:42,850
probably the quaint miners so it's a
 

125
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,730
probably the quaint miners so it's a
script that we run on a given computer

126
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:44,740
script that we run on a given computer
 

127
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,730
script that we run on a given computer
and that computer will start mining

128
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:47,740
and that computer will start mining
 

129
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,430
and that computer will start mining
bitcoins for the for the mowers so you

130
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:50,440
bitcoins for the for the mowers so you
 

131
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,390
bitcoins for the for the mowers so you
call these file lists malware so does

132
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
call these file lists malware so does
 

133
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,190
call these file lists malware so does
that mean that it just loads right into

134
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,200
that mean that it just loads right into
 

135
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,590
that mean that it just loads right into
RAM from a website yes it will actually

136
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:58,600
RAM from a website yes it will actually
 

137
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,840
RAM from a website yes it will actually
be it it will be a script that will be

138
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:00,850
be it it will be a script that will be
 

139
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,210
be it it will be a script that will be
running in memory whenever you go to

140
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:03,220
running in memory whenever you go to
 

141
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,120
running in memory whenever you go to
those websites and if your existing

142
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,130
those websites and if your existing
 

143
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,640
those websites and if your existing
endpoint security product cannot scan or

144
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:08,650
endpoint security product cannot scan or
 

145
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,250
endpoint security product cannot scan or
cannot protect your memory in real time

146
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,260
cannot protect your memory in real time
 

147
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,950
cannot protect your memory in real time
you will be subset susceptible to that

148
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:13,960
you will be subset susceptible to that
 

149
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,260
you will be subset susceptible to that
kind of threat in general so sounds to

150
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,270
kind of threat in general so sounds to
 

151
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,910
kind of threat in general so sounds to
me like another like wanna cry as the

152
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
me like another like wanna cry as the
 

153
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,220
me like another like wanna cry as the
first kind of example of ransomware yeah

154
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,230
first kind of example of ransomware yeah
 

155
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,410
first kind of example of ransomware yeah
another threat where basic like

156
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,420
another threat where basic like
 

157
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,630
another threat where basic like
antivirus and you lose the absolutely

158
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
antivirus and you lose the absolutely
 

159
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,420
antivirus and you lose the absolutely
virus because your anti-malware is a

160
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:27,430
virus because your anti-malware is a
 

161
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,460
virus because your anti-malware is a
term that we in the industry use these

162
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,470
term that we in the industry use these
 

163
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,740
term that we in the industry use these
days because really it's not just

164
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:31,750
days because really it's not just
 

165
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,480
days because really it's not just
viruses that we are dealing with as

166
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:33,490
viruses that we are dealing with as
 

167
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,560
viruses that we are dealing with as
threats anymore so

168
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:34,570
threats anymore so
 

169
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,190
threats anymore so
so is antivirus is it sufficient anymore

170
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,200
so is antivirus is it sufficient anymore
 

171
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,760
so is antivirus is it sufficient anymore
I don't I don't believe in C virus has

172
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:41,770
I don't I don't believe in C virus has
 

173
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,370
I don't I don't believe in C virus has
been sufficient for a long time so not

174
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,380
been sufficient for a long time so not
 

175
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,190
been sufficient for a long time so not
only we have the viruses out there we

176
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
only we have the viruses out there we
 

177
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,080
only we have the viruses out there we
have those files as malware's we have

178
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,090
have those files as malware's we have
 

179
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,190
have those files as malware's we have
the crypto actors in general the ransom

180
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
the crypto actors in general the ransom
 

181
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,590

layers we have Trojans we have back

182
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:55,600
layers we have Trojans we have back
 

183
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,800
layers we have Trojans we have back
doors we have exploits so in general

184
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:58,810
doors we have exploits so in general
 

185
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,610
doors we have exploits so in general
antivirus enough you know is it better

186
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:02,620
antivirus enough you know is it better
 

187
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,160
antivirus enough you know is it better
than not having anything yes but if you

188
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,170
than not having anything yes but if you
 

189
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,500
than not having anything yes but if you
have the option and yes you do have the

190
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,510
have the option and yes you do have the
 

191
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,940
have the option and yes you do have the
options sometimes we are talking about

192
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:08,950
options sometimes we are talking about
 

193
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,220
options sometimes we are talking about
one dollar more expensive or something

194
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,230
one dollar more expensive or something
 

195
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,860
one dollar more expensive or something
like that you can go to a full suite of

196
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:13,870
like that you can go to a full suite of
 

197
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,160
like that you can go to a full suite of
an endpoint security product which will

198
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,170
an endpoint security product which will
 

199
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,610
an endpoint security product which will
provide you a much better protection

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
what what features of a product like
 

219
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,180
what what features of a product like
endpoint protection advanced isn't it

that are taking protection to the next

222
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,340
that are taking protection to the next
 

223
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,550
that are taking protection to the next
level for those users so file this

224
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
level for those users so file this
 

225
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,950
level for those users so file this
attacks yep ransomware attacks like

226
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
attacks yep ransomware attacks like
 

227
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
attacks yep ransomware attacks like
these are threats that can take

228
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,250
these are threats that can take
 

229
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,640
these are threats that can take
businesses and put them out of this yes

230
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:50,650
businesses and put them out of this yes
 

231
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,280
businesses and put them out of this yes
yep then and bankrupt their owners yeah

232
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,290
yep then and bankrupt their owners yeah
 

233
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,380
yep then and bankrupt their owners yeah
absolutely that's the reason saying yeah

absolutely that's the reason saying yeah
 

235
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,080
absolutely that's the reason saying yeah
so what what features so are those more

236
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,090
so what what features so are those more
 

237
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,180
so what what features so are those more
advanced why do I need to pay Morris and

238
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,190
advanced why do I need to pay Morris and
 

239
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,050
advanced why do I need to pay Morris and
yeah absolutely

240
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,060
yeah absolutely
 

241
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,360
yeah absolutely
specifically to reset the modules that

242
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,370
specifically to reset the modules that
 

243
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,460

we add those more advanced features is

244
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:05,470
we add those more advanced features is
 

245
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,960
we add those more advanced features is
called hips which stands for host

246
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:06,970
called hips which stands for host
 

247
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,120
called hips which stands for host
intrusion prevention system and that's

248
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,130
intrusion prevention system and that's
 

249
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,920
intrusion prevention system and that's
where we have the advanced memory

250
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:10,930
where we have the advanced memory
 

251
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,780
where we have the advanced memory
scanner which is basically protecting

252
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:12,790
scanner which is basically protecting
 

253
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,030
scanner which is basically protecting
your memory in real time the final and

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,040
your memory in real time the final and
 

255
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,100
your memory in real time the final and
that mostly associated to the file as

that mostly associated to the file as
 

257
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,670
that mostly associated to the file as
malware we have the exploit blocker so

258
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:20,680
malware we have the exploit blocker so
 

259
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,980
malware we have the exploit blocker so
let's say whenever a new company

260
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:22,990
let's say whenever a new company
 

261
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,500
let's say whenever a new company
releases a publicly available exploit

262
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,510
releases a publicly available exploit
 

263
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,930
releases a publicly available exploit
for a vulnerability let's say this week

264
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:27,940
for a vulnerability let's say this week
 

265
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,610
for a vulnerability let's say this week
we actually had a pretty severe

266
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:29,620
we actually had a pretty severe
 

267
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,800
we actually had a pretty severe
vulnerability with Microsoft and they

268
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:31,810
vulnerability with Microsoft and they
 

269
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,810
vulnerability with Microsoft and they
actually release the patch the next day

270
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:33,820
actually release the patch the next day
 

271
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,130
actually release the patch the next day
or something like that

272
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,140
or something like that
 

273
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,000
or something like that
we will prevent that vulnerability from

274
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,010
we will prevent that vulnerability from
 

275
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,970
we will prevent that vulnerability from
being exploited earlier this is exactly

276
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:41,980
being exploited earlier this is exactly
 

277
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,130
being exploited earlier this is exactly
what he said accomplished with wanna cry

278
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,140
what he said accomplished with wanna cry
 

279
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,770
what he said accomplished with wanna cry
absolutely yes it was eternal it was

280
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:46,780
absolutely yes it was eternal it was
 

281
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,350
absolutely yes it was eternal it was
yeah it was the summer vulnerability and

282
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
yeah it was the summer vulnerability and
 

283
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,330
yeah it was the summer vulnerability and
yes we were able to actually prevent

284
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:51,340
yes we were able to actually prevent
 

285
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,190
yes we were able to actually prevent
that vulnerability from being exploited

286
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,200
that vulnerability from being exploited
 

287
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,080
that vulnerability from being exploited
in the first place so even though one

288
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,090
in the first place so even though one
 

289
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,910
in the first place so even though one
cry had never been discovered before

290
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:56,920
cry had never been discovered before
 

291
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,830
cry had never been discovered before
ESET was already proactively protected

292
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:58,840
ESET was already proactively protected
 

293
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,300
ESET was already proactively protected
absolutely and we were actually

294
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,310
absolutely and we were actually
 

295
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,450
absolutely and we were actually
providing that kind of fix two weeks

296
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:03,460
providing that kind of fix two weeks
 

297
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,580
providing that kind of fix two weeks
before when a crime actually existed

298
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:05,590
before when a crime actually existed
 

299
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,130
before when a crime actually existed
fantastic we had that kind of preventive

300
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,140
fantastic we had that kind of preventive
 

301
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,380
fantastic we had that kind of preventive
maintenance like the Oprah and you want

302
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,390
maintenance like the Oprah and you want
 

303
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,000
maintenance like the Oprah and you want
an anti-malware product that is going to

304
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,010
an anti-malware product that is going to
 

305
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,490
an anti-malware product that is going to
be proactive instead of reactive

306
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,500
be proactive instead of reactive
 

307
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,870
be proactive instead of reactive
absolutely yes because in the case of

308
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:15,880
absolutely yes because in the case of
 

309
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,220
absolutely yes because in the case of
something like ransomware you can lose

310
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,230
something like ransomware you can lose
 

311
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,940
something like ransomware you can lose
everything

312
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:17,950
everything
 

313
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,880
everything
yep and so there is no reactive response

314
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:20,890
yep and so there is no reactive response
 

315
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,220
yep and so there is no reactive response
to that then I hope your backups are

316
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,230
to that then I hope your backups are
 

317
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,620
to that then I hope your backups are
good yes actually

318
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:25,630
good yes actually
 

319
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,390
good yes actually
going back to that initial question

320
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:27,400
going back to that initial question
 

321
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,550
going back to that initial question
about the current threat landscape you

322
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:29,560
about the current threat landscape you
 

323
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,110
about the current threat landscape you
are seeing the still you're seeing a

324
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
are seeing the still you're seeing a
 

325
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,720
are seeing the still you're seeing a
really prevalent presence of the rest

326
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:33,730
really prevalent presence of the rest
 

327
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,840
really prevalent presence of the rest
we're however now the the crypto actors

328
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:36,850
we're however now the the crypto actors
 

329
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,340
we're however now the the crypto actors
in just in this general they are not

330
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,350
in just in this general they are not
 

331
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,380
in just in this general they are not
only encrypting your data and holding

332

you for ransom but if you're not paying
 

335
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,280
you for ransom but if you're not paying
they are actually releasing the data and

336
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,290
they are actually releasing the data and
 

337
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,060
they are actually releasing the data and
selling that

338
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,070
selling that
 

339
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,940
selling that

when the antivirus has been working so

354
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:05,890
when the antivirus has been working so
 

355
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,460
when the antivirus has been working so
well for me for so long so as you said

356
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:08,470
well for me for so long so as you said
 

357
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,410
well for me for so long so as you said
it might be a couple bucks more dollars

358
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,420
it might be a couple bucks more dollars
 

359
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,160
it might be a couple bucks more dollars
so more per seat which can be a lot if

360
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,170
so more per seat which can be a lot if
 

361
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,960
so more per seat which can be a lot if
you've got ten thousand computers but in

362
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:15,970
you've got ten thousand computers but in
 

363
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,090
you've got ten thousand computers but in
a in a small medium business it's not

364
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,100
a in a small medium business it's not
 

365
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,840
a in a small medium business it's not
that much why would I pay more the

366
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:21,850
that much why would I pay more the
 

367
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,300
that much why would I pay more the
additional features that we have in the

368
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,310
additional features that we have in the
 

369
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,110
additional features that we have in the
full endpoint security solution from a

370
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,120
full endpoint security solution from a
 

371
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,760
full endpoint security solution from a
technical perspective and again I'm

372
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:29,770
technical perspective and again I'm
 

373
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,370
technical perspective and again I'm
talking about one does more is well

374
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:32,380
talking about one does more is well
 

375
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,560
talking about one does more is well
worth it the value is actually there so

376
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,570
worth it the value is actually there so
 

377
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,260
worth it the value is actually there so
I'm thinking of not only adding

378
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,270
I'm thinking of not only adding
 

379
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,300
I'm thinking of not only adding
additional layers of protection to your

380
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,310
additional layers of protection to your
 

381
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,700
additional layers of protection to your
computer either at home or at your

382
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:41,710
computer either at home or at your
 

383
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,430
computer either at home or at your
business but I'm also getting additional

384
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,440
business but I'm also getting additional
 

385
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,320
business but I'm also getting additional
visibility on what's happening on your

386
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,330
visibility on what's happening on your
 

387
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,380
visibility on what's happening on your
environment as well so let's say one of

388
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,390
environment as well so let's say one of
 

389
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,380
environment as well so let's say one of
the features on that new on that bigger

390
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,390
the features on that new on that bigger
 

391
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,760
the features on that new on that bigger
product let's say the endpoint security

392
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:53,770
product let's say the endpoint security
 

393
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,670
product let's say the endpoint security
is a personal firewall which will

394
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:56,680
is a personal firewall which will
 

395
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,320
is a personal firewall which will
potentially hit place your Windows

396
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,330
potentially hit place your Windows
 

397
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:58,860
potentially hit place your Windows
Firewall

398
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:58,870
Firewall
 

399
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,050
Firewall
in my computer and not only it will

400
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,060
in my computer and not only it will
 

401
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,690
in my computer and not only it will
allow you to actually have visibility on

402
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:03,700
allow you to actually have visibility on
 

403
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,060
allow you to actually have visibility on
the network layer so instead of only

404
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,070
the network layer so instead of only
 

405
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,250
the network layer so instead of only
looking for viruses or Trojans or

406
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,260
looking for viruses or Trojans or
 

407
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,560
looking for viruses or Trojans or
ransomware yeah I'm also looking for

408
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,570
ransomware yeah I'm also looking for
 

409
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,690
ransomware yeah I'm also looking for
duplicate IP address I'm looking for DNS

410
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:12,700
duplicate IP address I'm looking for DNS
 

411
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,270
duplicate IP address I'm looking for DNS
poisoning that's interesting yeah yeah

412
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
poisoning that's interesting yeah yeah
 

413
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,510
poisoning that's interesting yeah yeah
yeah so now possibly network traffic

414
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:18,520
yeah so now possibly network traffic
 

415
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,390
yeah so now possibly network traffic
problems or even social yes which are

416
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:21,400
problems or even social yes which are
 

417
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,370
problems or even social yes which are
not necessarily security incidents but

418
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:26,380
not necessarily security incidents but
 

419
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,710
not necessarily security incidents but
it can be a natural threat so for

420
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
it can be a natural threat so for
 

421
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,480
it can be a natural threat so for
example one of the detection that we

422
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,490
example one of the detection that we
 

423
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,000
example one of the detection that we
have is a port scanning so maybe your

424
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,010
have is a port scanning so maybe your
 

425
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,880
have is a port scanning so maybe your
users is a given actor inside your

426
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:35,890
users is a given actor inside your
 

427
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,210
users is a given actor inside your
network is scanning your servers for

428
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,220
network is scanning your servers for
 

429
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,700
network is scanning your servers for
whatever reason where's they're not

430
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:41,710
whatever reason where's they're not
 

431
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,680
whatever reason where's they're not
supposed to be doing that so yeah it

432
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:43,690
supposed to be doing that so yeah it
 

433
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,450
supposed to be doing that so yeah it
gives you that visibility so you can

434
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:45,460
gives you that visibility so you can
 

435
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,770
gives you that visibility so you can
actually go to the user and have a

436
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:46,780
actually go to the user and have a
 

437
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,390
actually go to the user and have a
conversation to see what's what's going

438
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,400
conversation to see what's what's going
 

439
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,710
conversation to see what's what's going
on yeah I've never really thought about

440
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:49,720
on yeah I've never really thought about
 

441
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,230
on yeah I've never really thought about
that as a threat yeah because like a

442
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
that as a threat yeah because like a
 

443
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,360
that as a threat yeah because like a
duplicate IP address you just think oh

444
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,370
duplicate IP address you just think oh
 

445
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,290
duplicate IP address you just think oh
well I accident

446
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,300
well I accident
 

447
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,120
well I accident
the same IP to a printer or something

448
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,130
the same IP to a printer or something
 

449
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,950
the same IP to a printer or something
but what if it's a threat actor exactly

450
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:58,960
but what if it's a threat actor exactly
 

451
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,260
but what if it's a threat actor exactly
yeah maybe someone is moving there that

452
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,270
yeah maybe someone is moving there that
 

453
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,320
yeah maybe someone is moving there that
IP address yeah mm-hmm interesting and

454
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,330
IP address yeah mm-hmm interesting and
 

455
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,240
IP address yeah mm-hmm interesting and
you mentioned about the firewall how and

456
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,250
you mentioned about the firewall how and
 

457
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,100
you mentioned about the firewall how and
I don't want to put you too much on the

458
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,110
I don't want to put you too much on the
 

459
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,780
I don't want to put you too much on the
spot but absolutely I mean Microsoft

460
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:09,790
spot but absolutely I mean Microsoft
 

461
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,270
spot but absolutely I mean Microsoft
Windows 10 comes with a firewall yep so

462
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,280
Windows 10 comes with a firewall yep so
 

463
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,360
Windows 10 comes with a firewall yep so
do I really need to supplement my

464
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,370
do I really need to supplement my
 

465
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,490
do I really need to supplement my
anti-malware with a firewall for Mesa we

466
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,500
anti-malware with a firewall for Mesa we
 

467
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,700
anti-malware with a firewall for Mesa we
do see a two main approaches for that

468
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:20,710
do see a two main approaches for that
 

469
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,830
do see a two main approaches for that
replacement let's say so the first one

470
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:22,840
replacement let's say so the first one
 

471
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,690
replacement let's say so the first one
is ease of use so we do provide a

472
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:24,700
is ease of use so we do provide a
 

473
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,670
is ease of use so we do provide a
management console that will allow you

474
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:26,680
management console that will allow you
 

475
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,960
management console that will allow you
to have much more user-friendly

476
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:29,970
to have much more user-friendly
 

477
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,950
to have much more user-friendly
configuration and deployment of that

478
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:31,960
configuration and deployment of that
 

479
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,210
configuration and deployment of that
that's specific and we're talking

480
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:33,220
that's specific and we're talking
 

481
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,860
that's specific and we're talking
centralized manner not certainly yeah

482
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:34,870
centralized manner not certainly yeah
 

483
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,320
centralized manner not certainly yeah
okay so all 10,000 of my computer's yeah

484

automated so it's it's pretty convenient
to use and the second reason is the

494
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:48,460
to use and the second reason is the
 

495
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,880
to use and the second reason is the
visibility so you do have access to a

496
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:50,890
visibility so you do have access to a
 

497
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,710
visibility so you do have access to a
lot of reporting that's actually coming

on a given time frame so that's the kind
 

509
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,830
on a given time frame so that's the kind
of awareness the kind of visibility that

from three years ago you might be losing

562
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:17,500
from three years ago you might be losing
 

563
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,830
from three years ago you might be losing
some advanced advanced features in there

564
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:19,840
some advanced advanced features in there
 

565
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,380
some advanced advanced features in there
so you might be actually lagging behind

566
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,390
so you might be actually lagging behind
 

567
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,080
so you might be actually lagging behind
and sometimes they will eventually win

568
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,090
and sometimes they will eventually win
 

569
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,640
and sometimes they will eventually win
over your computer and you might

570
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:26,650
over your computer and you might
 

571
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,350
over your computer and you might
experience some some laws or some

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:30,460
incidents in general so it's really
 

575
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,690
incidents in general so it's really
important as a vendor to be as updated

protected we are seeing coming back to a

592
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:52,690
protected we are seeing coming back to a
 

593
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,940
protected we are seeing coming back to a
question we are seeing a lot of the the

594
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:56,950
question we are seeing a lot of the the
 

595
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,730
question we are seeing a lot of the the
movements in general whenever we are

596
00:11:59,730 --> 00:11:59,740
movements in general whenever we are
 

597
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,400
movements in general whenever we are
looking at the data so we are seeing a

598
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,410
looking at the data so we are seeing a
 

599
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,830
looking at the data so we are seeing a
lot of the new threats coming from two

600
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:04,840
lot of the new threats coming from two
 

601
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,670
lot of the new threats coming from two
main avenues let's say so the first one

602
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:08,680
main avenues let's say so the first one
 

603
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,660
main avenues let's say so the first one
is hardware

604
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:09,670
is hardware
 

605
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,600
is hardware
so whenever thinking of FEMA for example

606
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,610
so whenever thinking of FEMA for example
 

607
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,730
so whenever thinking of FEMA for example
you have a BIOS update you have a new

608
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:14,740
you have a BIOS update you have a new
 

609
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,190
you have a BIOS update you have a new
chipset on your computer yes it's

610
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
chipset on your computer yes it's
 

611
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,570
chipset on your computer yes it's
actually possible to in fact or to - in

612
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:21,580
actually possible to in fact or to - in
 

613
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,579
actually possible to in fact or to - in
fact that given a component on your

614
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:23,589
fact that given a component on your
 

615
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:28,440
fact that given a component on your
computer another point that we have and

616
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,450
computer another point that we have and
 

617
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,329
computer another point that we have and
we actually have a lot of research going

618
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:30,339
we actually have a lot of research going
 

619
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,300
we actually have a lot of research going
on on that specific one is the user

620
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,310
on on that specific one is the user
 

621
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,390
on on that specific one is the user
behavior so let's say that usually when

622
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,400
behavior so let's say that usually when
 

623
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
behavior so let's say that usually when
you think user behavior probably the

624
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:37,930
you think user behavior probably the
 

625
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,650
you think user behavior probably the
biggest example is credit card company

626
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:40,660
biggest example is credit card company
 

627
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,810
biggest example is credit card company
so you have your credit card in Canada

628
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:42,820
so you have your credit card in Canada
 

629
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,640
so you have your credit card in Canada
that credit card has been used in

630
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,650
that credit card has been used in
 

631
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,870
that credit card has been used in
somewhere in Asia and hey even though

632
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
somewhere in Asia and hey even though
 

633
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,630
somewhere in Asia and hey even though
online shopping is available everywhere

online shopping is available everywhere
 

635
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,610
online shopping is available everywhere
it might create a trigger hey it's

636
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:53,620
it might create a trigger hey it's
 

637
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,110
it might create a trigger hey it's
something that that card is not supposed

638
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
something that that card is not supposed
 

639
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,480
something that that card is not supposed
to be used in Asia for example in Europe

640
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,490
to be used in Asia for example in Europe
 

641
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,650
to be used in Asia for example in Europe
or anywhere else and we are started to

642
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:01,660
or anywhere else and we are started to
 

643
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,130
or anywhere else and we are started to
see some some some efforts from

644
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:05,140
see some some some efforts from
 

645
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,140
see some some some efforts from
different vendors actually to try to

646
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,150
different vendors actually to try to
 

647
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,390
different vendors actually to try to
correlate all the incidents or all the

648
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,400
correlate all the incidents or all the
 

649
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,270
correlate all the incidents or all the
the the incidents in general the

650
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,280
the the incidents in general the
 

651
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,000
the the incidents in general the
security stance that we flag we also try

652
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,010
security stance that we flag we also try
 

653
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,770
security stance that we flag we also try
to map that to the actual user behavior

654
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:16,780
to map that to the actual user behavior
 

655
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,190
to map that to the actual user behavior
so hey that user has just had his email

656
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:20,200
so hey that user has just had his email
 

657
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
so hey that user has just had his email
access in Canada

658
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,610
access in Canada
 

659
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,510
access in Canada
being accessed in Europe nape that to

660
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:24,520
being accessed in Europe nape that to
 

661
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,920
being accessed in Europe nape that to
you that that's always traveling so yeah

662
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:25,930
you that that's always traveling so yeah
 

663
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,080
you that that's always traveling so yeah
it's kind of expected maybe not that

664
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,090
it's kind of expected maybe not that
 

665
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,120
it's kind of expected maybe not that
user is an internal user he has no

666
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,130
user is an internal user he has no
 

667
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,490
user is an internal user he has no
reason to have that kind of exposure in

668
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:32,500
reason to have that kind of exposure in
 

669
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,350
reason to have that kind of exposure in
there so we can actually create a ticket

670
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:34,360
there so we can actually create a ticket
 

671
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,950
there so we can actually create a ticket
and we can't flag that as a potential

672
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:36,960
and we can't flag that as a potential
 

673
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
and we can't flag that as a potential
incident so your admins can can take a

674
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:39,970
incident so your admins can can take a
 

675
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,300
incident so your admins can can take a
look at it interesting and we can do

676
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,310
look at it interesting and we can do
 

677
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,610
look at it interesting and we can do
that so this is not as a third-party

678
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:44,620
that so this is not as a third-party
 

679
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,280
that so this is not as a third-party
service but as an internal absolutely

680
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,290
service but as an internal absolutely
 

681
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,730
service but as an internal absolutely
powerful TR in mastering and again the

682
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:50,740
powerful TR in mastering and again the
 

683
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,530
powerful TR in mastering and again the
amount of data that's coming out of

684
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:52,540
amount of data that's coming out of
 

685
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,740
amount of data that's coming out of
those surfaces is so big that automation

686
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:55,750
those surfaces is so big that automation
 

687
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,230
those surfaces is so big that automation
is it's critical for that and so we do

688
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
is it's critical for that and so we do
 

689
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,270
is it's critical for that and so we do
have a lot of automation capabilities in

690
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:00,280
have a lot of automation capabilities in
 

691
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,700
have a lot of automation capabilities in
our products yeah

692
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:01,710
our products yeah
 

693
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,260
our products yeah
and again it's everything to make your

694
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,270
and again it's everything to make your
 

695
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,820
and again it's everything to make your
life easier and I've never really

696
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:05,830
life easier and I've never really
 

697
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,320
life easier and I've never really
thought of it outside the context of the

698
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,330
thought of it outside the context of the
 

699
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,660
thought of it outside the context of the
credit card like a perfect example if I

700
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:09,670
credit card like a perfect example if I
 

701
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,970
credit card like a perfect example if I
view it and you see it sometimes where

702
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:11,980
view it and you see it sometimes where
 

703
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,580
view it and you see it sometimes where
is it's an inconvenience but if your

704
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:14,590
is it's an inconvenience but if your
 

705
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,260
is it's an inconvenience but if your
credit card ever was stolen and used

706
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,270
credit card ever was stolen and used
 

707
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,090
credit card ever was stolen and used
maliciously then you want to know about

708
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,100
maliciously then you want to know about
 

709
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,650
maliciously then you want to know about
it and here's a service that you're

710
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:19,660
it and here's a service that you're
 

711
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,330
it and here's a service that you're
offering and evolving in 2020 that is

712
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:23,340
offering and evolving in 2020 that is
 

713
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,280
offering and evolving in 2020 that is
in-house so absolutely I have control

714
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,290
in-house so absolutely I have control
 

715
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,960
in-house so absolutely I have control
over that so you're thinking of your

716
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:27,970
over that so you're thinking of your
 

717
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,550
over that so you're thinking of your
credit card what if it's your email

718
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:29,560
credit card what if it's your email
 

719
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,880
credit card what if it's your email
access or maybe your scene number public

720
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:32,890
access or maybe your scene number public
 

721
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,310
access or maybe your scene number public
data basically its private it should be

722
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,320
data basically its private it should be
 

723
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,500
data basically its private it should be
private and we are trying to make it

724
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,510
private and we are trying to make it
 

725
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,990
private and we are trying to make it
remain private so is that the evolution

726
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
remain private so is that the evolution
 

727
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,810
remain private so is that the evolution
of malware do you think is targeting

728
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:42,820
of malware do you think is targeting
 

729
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,710
of malware do you think is targeting
data

730
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:43,720
data
 

731
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,980
data
yeah I would say so I don't see specific

732
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:48,990
yeah I would say so I don't see specific
 

733
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,620
yeah I would say so I don't see specific
data to confirm that that application

734
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:52,630
data to confirm that that application
 

735
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,390
data to confirm that that application
but I do believe that's that's something

736
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:54,400
but I do believe that's that's something
 

737
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,940
but I do believe that's that's something
that is going to happen we are having we

738
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:56,950
that is going to happen we are having we
 

739
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,050
that is going to happen we are having we
are we as citizens we are actually

740
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,060
are we as citizens we are actually
 

741
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,300
are we as citizens we are actually
producing more data every single day the

742
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,310
producing more data every single day the
 

743
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,740
producing more data every single day the
amount of data that we have associated

744
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:04,750
amount of data that we have associated
 

745
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,170
amount of data that we have associated
to our profiles is massive either from

746
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,180
to our profiles is massive either from
 

747
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,410
to our profiles is massive either from
financial data healthcare data social

748
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,420
financial data healthcare data social
 

749
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,310
financial data healthcare data social
networking data work data basically so

750
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,320
networking data work data basically so
 

751
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,180
networking data work data basically so
we should see more custom attacks

752
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,190
we should see more custom attacks
 

753
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,640
we should see more custom attacks
targeting specific users or specifically

754
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:23,650
targeting specific users or specifically
 

755
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,680
targeting specific users or specifically

year I think from the cybersecurity land

768
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,290
year I think from the cybersecurity land
 

769
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,679
year I think from the cybersecurity land
absolutely are we still seeing attacks

770
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:42,689
absolutely are we still seeing attacks
 

771
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,329
absolutely are we still seeing attacks
in the ransomware end of things are we

772
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:44,339
in the ransomware end of things are we
 

773
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,050
in the ransomware end of things are we
still yes that customers are generally

774
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,060
still yes that customers are generally
 

775
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,429
still yes that customers are generally
protected against them yes there is - a

776
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:49,439
protected against them yes there is - a
 

777
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,340
protected against them yes there is - a
lot of ransomware going on I don't see

778
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,350
lot of ransomware going on I don't see
 

779
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,850
lot of ransomware going on I don't see
that going down not not not not in the

780
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:55,860
that going down not not not not in the
 

781
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,999
that going down not not not not in the
near future at least it's still evolving

782
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,009
near future at least it's still evolving
 

783
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:03,980
near future at least it's still evolving
and the the actual organizations that

784
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:03,990
and the the actual organizations that
 

785
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,079
and the the actual organizations that
actually organization the backend that

786
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,089
actually organization the backend that
 

787
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:07,759
actually organization the backend that
are running with those rare somewhere

788
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:07,769
are running with those rare somewhere
 

789
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,769
are running with those rare somewhere
they are still making a profit that's

790
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:09,779
they are still making a profit that's
 

791
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,199
they are still making a profit that's
the same yeah so yeah the question for

792
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:12,209
the same yeah so yeah the question for
 

793
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:13,699
the same yeah so yeah the question for
years when it was just viruses on the

794
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:13,709
years when it was just viruses on the
 

795
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,650
years when it was just viruses on the
landscape the question was always what's

796
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:15,660
landscape the question was always what's
 

797
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,569
landscape the question was always what's
the motivation of a hacker yep to do

798
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:17,579
the motivation of a hacker yep to do
 

799
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:17,990
the motivation of a hacker yep to do
