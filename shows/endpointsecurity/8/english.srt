we tend to think of hackers as

we tend to think of hackers as

while we are basically in quarantine in

while we are basically in quarantine in
 

27
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,170
while we are basically in quarantine in
our own homes what where is the hacker

28
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:44,180
our own homes what where is the hacker
 

29
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,530
our own homes what where is the hacker
and that's why in the cybersecurity

30
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:47,540
and that's why in the cybersecurity
 

31
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,799
and that's why in the cybersecurity
industry we fear that there may be more

industry we fear that there may be more

of a risk now than there was two three

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:23,930
Stephen I alluded to some of the concern
 

61
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,830
Stephen I alluded to some of the concern
in the cyber security industry with the

62
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:26,840
in the cyber security industry with the
 

63
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,800
in the cyber security industry with the
fact that we do expect an elevation in

64
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:29,810
fact that we do expect an elevation in
 

65
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,750
fact that we do expect an elevation in
the threat level when it comes to cyber

66
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:31,760
the threat level when it comes to cyber
 

67
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,890
the threat level when it comes to cyber
security right and part of that comes

68
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:35,900
security right and part of that comes
 

69
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,610
security right and part of that comes
from our need to work from home there

70
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:39,620
from our need to work from home there
 

71
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,170
from our need to work from home there
are so many different technologies that

72
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,180
are so many different technologies that
 

73
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,399
are so many different technologies that
we should be tapping into and the

74
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:42,409
we should be tapping into and the
 

75
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,670
we should be tapping into and the
companies are tapping into can I just

76
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
companies are tapping into can I just
 

77
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,830
companies are tapping into can I just
give you the opportunity to kind of open

78
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
give you the opportunity to kind of open
 

79
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,200
give you the opportunity to kind of open
the floor to you to discuss how these

80
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,210
the floor to you to discuss how these
 

81
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,420
the floor to you to discuss how these
technologies can be not only helpful but

82
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,430
technologies can be not only helpful but
 

83
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,590
technologies can be not only helpful but
also dangerous in our organizations

84
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
also dangerous in our organizations
 

85
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,500
also dangerous in our organizations
right so I think as you alluded to at

86
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,510
right so I think as you alluded to at
 

87
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,920
right so I think as you alluded to at
the beginning the the activity of what I

88
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:02,930
the beginning the the activity of what I
 

89
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,560
the beginning the the activity of what I
would call criminal hacking I mean if I

90
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:05,570
would call criminal hacking I mean if I
 

91
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,730
would call criminal hacking I mean if I
these days I just tend to go to

92
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:06,740
these days I just tend to go to
 

93
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,229
these days I just tend to go to
criminals oh you know criminal activity

94
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:11,239
criminals oh you know criminal activity
 

95
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,920
criminals oh you know criminal activity
I don't think he's taking a break

96
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:13,930
I don't think he's taking a break
 

97
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,160
I don't think he's taking a break
although criminals may be working from

98
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,170
although criminals may be working from
 

99
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,140
although criminals may be working from
home now more than they were

100
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,150
home now more than they were
 

101
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,080
home now more than they were
because it a lot of criminal hacking is

102
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,090
because it a lot of criminal hacking is
 

103
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,039
because it a lot of criminal hacking is
pretty organized and you know takes

104
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,049
pretty organized and you know takes
 

105
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,539
pretty organized and you know takes
place in a structured environment in

106
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:28,549
place in a structured environment in
 

107
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,149
place in a structured environment in
many cases but through this disruption

108
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:31,159
many cases but through this disruption
 

109
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,429
many cases but through this disruption
from the earliest outbreak news onwards

110
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:36,439
from the earliest outbreak news onwards
 

111
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,349
from the earliest outbreak news onwards
we've seen a willingness by some

112
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:38,359
we've seen a willingness by some
 

113
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,740
we've seen a willingness by some
criminals to exploit this some of the

114
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:41,750
criminals to exploit this some of the
 

115
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,490
criminals to exploit this some of the
first things we saw were using the virus

116
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,500
first things we saw were using the virus
 

117
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,420
first things we saw were using the virus
as a bait to get people to open phishing

118
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,430
as a bait to get people to open phishing
 

119
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,789
as a bait to get people to open phishing
emails searching you know phishing

120
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:51,799
emails searching you know phishing
 

121
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,250
emails searching you know phishing
emails which were sent to trick people

122
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,260
emails which were sent to trick people
 

123
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,030
emails which were sent to trick people
into loading malicious code or visiting

124
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,040
into loading malicious code or visiting
 

125
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,930
into loading malicious code or visiting
malicious websites and so if we can

126
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:01,940
malicious websites and so if we can
 

127
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,030
malicious websites and so if we can
assume based on past experience of

128
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,040
assume based on past experience of
 

129
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,160
assume based on past experience of
crisis situations that there will be

130
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,170
crisis situations that there will be
 

131
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,720
crisis situations that there will be
part of the criminal element which will

132
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:10,730
part of the criminal element which will
 

133
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,179
part of the criminal element which will
try and use that and for people who are

134
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:15,189
try and use that and for people who are
 

135
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:18,849
try and use that and for people who are
working normally in an office with an IT

136
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:18,859
working normally in an office with an IT
 

137
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:21,039
working normally in an office with an IT
support group either on the phone or

00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,049
support group either on the phone or
 

139
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,689
support group either on the phone or
down the hall they're not as exposed

140
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:24,699
down the hall they're not as exposed
 

141
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:30,129
down the hall they're not as exposed
necessarily to that activity as when

142
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:30,139
necessarily to that activity as when
 

143
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,259
necessarily to that activity as when
they're at home when they're at home

144
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:32,269
they're at home when they're at home
 

145
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,020
they're at home when they're at home
typically a lot of employees aren't

146
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030
typically a lot of employees aren't
 

147
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,140
typically a lot of employees aren't
doing company work and so you've got

148
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,150
doing company work and so you've got
 

149
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,589
doing company work and so you've got
this situation where people are in a

150
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
this situation where people are in a
 

151
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,899
this situation where people are in a
different environment potentially using

152
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:43,909
different environment potentially using
 

153
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:46,990
different environment potentially using
technology they're not familiar with and

154
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,000
technology they're not familiar with and
 

155
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,360
technology they're not familiar with and
being potentially subject to attack by

156
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,370
being potentially subject to attack by
 

157
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,399
being potentially subject to attack by
criminals in in some form or another

158
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:54,409
criminals in in some form or another
 

159
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:58,199
criminals in in some form or another
now one of the things that that's

160
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:58,209
now one of the things that that's
 

161
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,909
now one of the things that that's
interesting about the term work from

162
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:00,919
interesting about the term work from
 

163
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,330
interesting about the term work from

00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,289
more or less prepared for this situation
 

177
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:24,750
more or less prepared for this situation
right

178
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:24,760

experience with that hardware and
 

205
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,270
experience with that hardware and
software and so for example the sales

206
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,280

739
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,410
do is they'll use those types of
websites to then infiltrate a system so

740
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:26,420
websites to then infiltrate a system so
 

741
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,270
websites to then infiltrate a system so
it may look like it is supposed to be

this and you're talking also about
 

745
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,470
this and you're talking also about
banking but it's a way for this malware

746
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
banking but it's a way for this malware
 

747
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,120

to get in as well yes and in fact you
 

749
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,060
to get in as well yes and in fact you
know John Johns Hopkins University in

750
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,070
know John Johns Hopkins University in
 

751
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,030

America is been doing a lot of tracking

752
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,040
America is been doing a lot of tracking
 

753
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,450
America is been doing a lot of tracking
and he's kind of the go-to source for a

754
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:46,460
and he's kind of the go-to source for a
 

755
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,690
and he's kind of the go-to source for a
lot of information on covert 19 and

lot of information on covert 19 and
 

757
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,000
lot of information on covert 19 and
early on their map I think it was of

758
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,010
early on their map I think it was of
 

759
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,500
early on their map I think it was of
infections was taken over or or abused

760
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:56,510
infections was taken over or or abused
 

761
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:03,360
infections was taken over or or abused
by hackers a criminal hacker - yeah so

762
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,370
by hackers a criminal hacker - yeah so
 

763
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,520
by hackers a criminal hacker - yeah so
it's not just a question of is this fake

764
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,530
it's not just a question of is this fake
 

765
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,270
it's not just a question of is this fake
kovat 19 information or is this

766
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
kovat 19 information or is this
 

767
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,730
kovat 19 information or is this
legitimate information is the sort the

768
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:12,740
legitimate information is the sort the
 

769
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,490
legitimate information is the sort the
legitimate source say and so any it

770
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:15,500
legitimate source say and so any it
 

771
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,560
legitimate source say and so any it
could be legitimate like phishing scams

772
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,570
could be legitimate like phishing scams
 

773

so let's take what we've learned here in
summary and bring it together into

hackers are let's let's make a
 

981
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,720
hackers are let's let's make a
distinction that we're talking criminal

982
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:36,730
distinction that we're talking criminal
 

983
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,150

right sure yes so maybe that's a
 

989
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,180
right sure yes so maybe that's a
generalized term at this point so

990
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,190
generalized term at this point so
 

991
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,970
generalized term at this point so
criminal hackers are smart they are

992
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:47,980
criminal hackers are smart they are
 

993

they're not all insecure but my chances

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,400
as a criminal the finding room that's

in Philadelphia you can find who's got
 

1175
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:21,120
in Philadelphia you can find who's got
their port open in Philadelphia and if I

their port open in Philadelphia and if I

concern with remote desktop is that an

RDP being the protocol so on your

1182
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:28,660
RDP being the protocol so on your
 

1183
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,150
RDP being the protocol so on your
Windows machine turning on remote

1184
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,160
Windows machine turning on remote
 

1185
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,770
Windows machine turning on remote
desktop but is simply the fact that

1186
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:31,780
desktop but is simply the fact that
 

1187
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,400
desktop but is simply the fact that
somebody

1188
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,410
somebody
 

1189
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,440
somebody
be brute-forcing your password and you'd

1190
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,450
be brute-forcing your password and you'd
 

1191
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,540
be brute-forcing your password and you'd
be none you.your none the wiser so

be none you.your none the wiser so
 

1193
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,240
be none you.your none the wiser so
eventually they get in and because

eventually they get in and because

eventually they get in and because
you're working from home you don't even

two-factor authentication we should not
 

1203

two-factor authentication we should not
