I'm<00:03:39.140><c> just</c><00:03:39.170><c> kidding</c><00:03:39.560><c> no</c><00:03:39.709><c> um</c><00:03:39.980><c> no</c><00:03:40.730><c> it's</c><00:03:41.209><c> if</c><00:03:41.840><c> it</c><00:03:42.019><c> was</c>

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 align:start position:0%
I'm just kidding no um no it's if it was
 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.570 align:start position:0%
I'm just kidding no um no it's if it was
more<00:03:42.380><c> critical</c><00:03:42.769><c> there</c><00:03:43.160><c> would</c><00:03:43.250><c> be</c><00:03:43.280><c> more</c>

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 align:start position:0%
more critical there would be more
 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
more critical there would be more
Porsche<00:03:44.480><c> about</c><00:03:44.780><c> it</c><00:03:44.930><c> like</c><00:03:45.170><c> we</c><00:03:45.290><c> saw</c><00:03:45.440><c> with</c><00:03:45.470><c> the</c>

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 align:start position:0%
Porsche about it like we saw with the
 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
Porsche about it like we saw with the
737<00:03:46.310><c> max</c><00:03:46.340><c> yeah</c><00:03:46.610><c> be</c><00:03:46.850><c> like</c><00:03:47.000><c> the</c><00:03:47.120><c> toilet</c><00:03:47.480><c> doesn't</c>

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 align:start position:0%
737 max yeah be like the toilet doesn't
 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
737 max yeah be like the toilet doesn't
flush<00:03:47.780><c> or</c><00:03:48.140><c> something</c><00:03:48.410><c> yeah</c><00:03:48.470><c> no</c><00:03:48.880><c> problem</c><00:03:49.910><c> yeah</c>

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 align:start position:0%
flush or something yeah no problem yeah
 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.910 align:start position:0%

again<00:03:50.870><c> it's</c><00:03:51.050><c> when</c><00:03:51.440><c> you're</c><00:03:51.560><c> talking</c><00:03:51.830><c> about</c>

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
again it's when you're talking about
 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.380 align:start position:0%
again it's when you're talking about
that<00:03:52.100><c> kind</c><00:03:52.310><c> of</c><00:03:52.430><c> stuff</c><00:03:52.489><c> I'm</c><00:03:52.820><c> guessing</c><00:03:53.209><c> that</c>

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff I'm guessing that
 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.110 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff I'm guessing that
it's<00:03:53.570><c> pulley</c><00:03:54.380><c> non-critical</c><00:03:55.310><c> systems</c><00:03:55.489><c> so</c><00:03:55.970><c> like</c>

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's pulley non-critical systems so like
 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.490 align:start position:0%
it's pulley non-critical systems so like
if<00:03:56.239><c> it's</c><00:03:56.390><c> just</c><00:03:56.450><c> like</c><00:03:56.630><c> because</c><00:03:57.290><c> there</c><00:03:57.440><c> are</c>

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 align:start position:0%
if it's just like because there are
 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.130 align:start position:0%
if it's just like because there are
things<00:03:57.620><c> days</c><00:03:58.310><c> your</c><00:03:58.489><c> digital</c><00:03:58.910><c> nowadays</c><00:03:59.600><c> yeah</c>

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.780 align:start position:0%
things days your digital nowadays yeah
right<00:04:00.560><c> especially</c><00:04:00.800><c> with</c><00:04:01.130><c> Airbus</c><00:04:01.489><c> planes</c>

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 align:start position:0%
right especially with Airbus planes
 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.330 align:start position:0%
right especially with Airbus planes
because<00:04:02.110><c> Airbus</c><00:04:03.110><c> believes</c><00:04:03.500><c> the</c><00:04:03.769><c> philosophy</c>

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 align:start position:0%
because Airbus believes the philosophy
 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.150 align:start position:0%
because Airbus believes the philosophy
of<00:04:04.450><c> the</c><00:04:05.450><c> plane</c><00:04:05.750><c> knows</c><00:04:05.989><c> how</c><00:04:06.170><c> to</c><00:04:06.230><c> fly</c><00:04:06.470><c> well</c><00:04:06.860><c> as</c>

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 align:start position:0%

Boeing thinks that the pilot knows how

Boeing thinks that the pilot knows how

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 align:start position:0%
to fly so in a Boeing plane you can
 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
to fly so in a Boeing plane you can

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 align:start position:0%
normally stall the plane as a pilot but
 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.050 align:start position:0%
normally stall the plane as a pilot but

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 align:start position:0%
an Airbus plan you can't because it's
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.699 align:start position:0%
an Airbus plan you can't because it's

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 align:start position:0%
like such a technical issue on an Airbus
 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
like such a technical issue on an Airbus
plane<00:04:23.479><c> is</c><00:04:23.600><c> kind</c><00:04:23.780><c> of</c><00:04:23.810><c> concerning</c><00:04:24.080><c> right</c>

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 align:start position:0%
plane is kind of concerning right
 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
plane is kind of concerning right
because<00:04:24.830><c> it's</c><00:04:25.010><c> just</c><00:04:25.280><c> it</c>

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 align:start position:0%
because it's just it
 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.990 align:start position:0%
because it's just it
more<00:04:25.870><c> electronically</c><00:04:26.860><c> controlled</c><00:04:27.280><c> than</c><00:04:27.970><c> a</c>

more electronically controlled than a
 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.730 align:start position:0%
more electronically controlled than a
standard<00:04:28.390><c> moon</c><00:04:28.570><c> plane</c><00:04:28.900><c> right</c><00:04:29.260><c> but</c><00:04:29.590><c> again</c>

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 align:start position:0%
standard moon plane right but again
 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.470 align:start position:0%
standard moon plane right but again
everything's<00:04:30.310><c> fly-by-wire</c><00:04:30.790><c> nowadays</c>

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
everything's fly-by-wire nowadays
 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.030 align:start position:0%
everything's fly-by-wire nowadays
everything's<00:04:31.960><c> electronically</c><00:04:32.650><c> controlled</c>

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
everything's electronically controlled
 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
everything's electronically controlled
so<00:04:33.600><c> hopefully</c><00:04:34.600><c> it's</c><00:04:34.720><c> nothing</c><00:04:34.930><c> too</c><00:04:35.350><c> critical</c>

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 align:start position:0%
so hopefully it's nothing too critical
 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
so hopefully it's nothing too critical
yeah<00:04:36.340><c> like</c><00:04:36.820><c> controls</c><00:04:37.450><c> or</c><00:04:37.750><c> anything</c><00:04:37.780><c> but</c><00:04:38.290><c> well</c>

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 align:start position:0%
yeah like controls or anything but well
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.610 align:start position:0%
yeah like controls or anything but well
the<00:04:39.550><c> the</c><00:04:40.000><c> other</c><00:04:40.060><c> question</c><00:04:40.510><c> is</c><00:04:40.630><c> how</c><00:04:40.690><c> easy</c><00:04:41.020><c> is</c><00:04:41.290><c> it</c>

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 align:start position:0%
the the other question is how easy is it
 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.790 align:start position:0%
the the other question is how easy is it
to<00:04:41.860><c> turn</c><00:04:42.400><c> a</c><00:04:42.640><c> plane</c><00:04:43.090><c> off</c><00:04:43.480><c> and</c><00:04:44.080><c> on</c><00:04:44.230><c> like</c><00:04:44.500><c> is</c><00:04:44.650><c> it</c>

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
to turn a plane off and on like is it
 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
to turn a plane off and on like is it
something<00:04:44.920><c> you</c><00:04:45.220><c> could</c><00:04:45.430><c> conceivably</c><00:04:45.850><c> just</c><00:04:46.450><c> do</c>

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 align:start position:0%
something you could conceivably just do
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.170 align:start position:0%
something you could conceivably just do

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 align:start position:0%
preemptively before any flight yeah it's
 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.450 align:start position:0%
preemptively before any flight yeah it's
it's<00:04:49.390><c> not</c><00:04:49.540><c> hard</c><00:04:49.900><c> to</c><00:04:49.990><c> do</c><00:04:50.170><c> but</c><00:04:50.560><c> as</c><00:04:50.860><c> we</c><00:04:51.010><c> saw</c><00:04:51.220><c> with</c>

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 align:start position:0%
it's not hard to do but as we saw with
 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
it's not hard to do but as we saw with
today's<00:04:51.970><c> earlier</c><00:04:52.360><c> story</c><00:04:52.750><c> it</c><00:04:52.870><c> does</c><00:04:53.020><c> take</c><00:04:53.230><c> time</c>

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 align:start position:0%
today's earlier story it does take time
 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.470 align:start position:0%
today's earlier story it does take time
for<00:04:53.710><c> instruments</c><00:04:54.250><c> to</c><00:04:54.430><c> know</c><00:04:55.030><c> where</c><00:04:55.180><c> they</c><00:04:55.330><c> are</c>

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 align:start position:0%

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
for instruments to know where they are
you<00:04:55.690><c> have</c><00:04:55.750><c> to</c><00:04:55.900><c> put</c><00:04:56.140><c> in</c><00:04:56.260><c> your</c><00:04:56.290><c> like</c><00:04:56.680><c> exact</c>

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 align:start position:0%
you have to put in your like exact
 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
you have to put in your like exact

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 align:start position:0%

is<00:05:02.050><c> money</c><00:05:02.290><c> yeah</c><00:05:02.920><c> it</c><00:05:03.730><c> adds</c><00:05:03.970><c> time</c><00:05:04.180><c> right</c><00:05:04.540><c> so</c><00:05:04.870><c> why</c>

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 align:start position:0%
is money yeah it adds time right so why
 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.290 align:start position:0%
is money yeah it adds time right so why
not<00:05:05.230><c> just</c><00:05:05.470><c> you</c><00:05:05.680><c> keep</c><00:05:05.890><c> certain</c><00:05:06.130><c> systems</c><00:05:06.670><c> on</c><00:05:06.850><c> if</c>

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 align:start position:0%
not just you keep certain systems on if
 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
not just you keep certain systems on if
it's<00:05:07.450><c> a</c><00:05:07.540><c> quick</c><00:05:07.690><c> turnaround</c><00:05:08.010><c> then</c><00:05:09.010><c> go</c><00:05:09.220><c> hmm</c><00:05:10.030><c> but</c>

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 align:start position:0%
it's a quick turnaround then go hmm but
 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's a quick turnaround then go hmm but
yeah<00:05:10.600><c> so</c><00:05:10.990><c> don't</c><00:05:11.650><c> be</c><00:05:11.830><c> silly</c><00:05:12.070><c> update</c><00:05:12.520><c> your</c>

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 align:start position:0%
yeah so don't be silly update your
 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
yeah so don't be silly update your
