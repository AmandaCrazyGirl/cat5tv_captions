it can be done and he did prove it and I
 

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
it can be done and he did prove it and I
mean<00:10:58.420><c> that's</c><00:10:58.779><c> good</c><00:10:59.560><c> that</c><00:10:59.950><c> it</c><00:11:00.130><c> it</c><00:11:00.550><c> ended</c><00:11:01.060><c> well</c>

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:01.330 align:start position:0%
mean that's good that it it ended well
 

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.710 align:start position:0%
mean that's good that it it ended well
but<00:11:01.839><c> it</c><00:11:01.959><c> could</c><00:11:02.560><c> have</c><00:11:03.070><c> ended</c><00:11:03.520><c> badly</c><00:11:03.730><c> and</c><00:11:04.540><c> so</c>

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
but it could have ended badly and so
 

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.990 align:start position:0%
but it could have ended badly and so
people<00:11:04.930><c> need</c><00:11:05.200><c> to</c><00:11:05.230><c> maybe</c><00:11:06.100><c> dial</c><00:11:06.550><c> it</c><00:11:06.730><c> back</c><00:11:06.760><c> like</c>

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
people need to maybe dial it back like
 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.030 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:21:20.030><c> so</c><00:21:20.390><c> I</c><00:21:20.750><c> guess</c><00:21:20.810><c> the</c><00:21:21.410><c> best</c><00:21:21.590><c> thing</c><00:21:21.830><c> to</c><00:21:21.860><c> do</c><00:21:22.190><c> is</c>

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:22.460 align:start position:0%
