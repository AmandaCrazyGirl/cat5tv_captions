00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:33.390 align:start position:0%

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
trying to lose weight no I'm trying to
 

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
trying to lose weight no I'm trying to

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.370 align:start position:0%
learn how how my body reacts to certain

learn how how my body reacts to certain

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
everything so this is like that but

this though is the fact that it's using

this though is the fact that it's using

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:05.790 align:start position:0%
the brain signals that would go to the

the brain signals that would go to the

mouth and voice box implies that you
 

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.490 align:start position:0%
mouth and voice box implies that you

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
have to have already been able to speak
 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
have to have already been able to speak
right<00:09:11.160><c> that's</c><00:09:11.430><c> why</c><00:09:11.640><c> they're</c><00:09:11.850><c> saying</c>

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:12.089 align:start position:0%
right that's why they're saying
 

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:14.329 align:start position:0%
right that's why they're saying
eventually<00:09:13.019><c> it</c><00:09:13.140><c> will</c><00:09:13.230><c> be</c><00:09:13.470><c> right</c><00:09:13.860><c> so</c><00:09:14.190><c> I</c><00:09:14.220><c> think</c>

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
eventually it will be right so I think
 

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
eventually it will be right so I think
it<00:09:14.459><c> would</c><00:09:14.579><c> be</c><00:09:14.670><c> hard</c><00:09:14.940><c> to</c><00:09:15.209><c> train</c><00:09:15.630><c> somebody</c><00:09:16.140><c> who's</c>

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.290 align:start position:0%
it would be hard to train somebody who's
 

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.710 align:start position:0%
it would be hard to train somebody who's
never<00:09:16.440><c> spoken</c><00:09:16.920><c> and</c><00:09:17.310><c> maybe</c><00:09:17.820><c> that's</c><00:09:18.089><c> it</c><00:09:18.329><c> yeah</c>

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
never spoken and maybe that's it yeah
 

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.269 align:start position:0%
never spoken and maybe that's it yeah
exactly<00:09:18.870><c> so</c><00:09:19.410><c> like</c><00:09:19.800><c> I'm</c><00:09:19.949><c> sitting</c><00:09:20.220><c> there</c>

there any restaurant example I think
 

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.259 align:start position:0%

then<00:18:51.830><c> what's</c><00:18:52.830><c> the</c><00:18:53.130><c> one</c><00:18:53.370><c> I</c><00:18:53.610><c> think</c><00:18:53.820><c> the</c><00:18:53.940><c> one</c><00:18:54.090><c> that</c>

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:54.269 align:start position:0%
then what's the one I think the one that
 

00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:56.570 align:start position:0%
then what's the one I think the one that
I've<00:18:54.389><c> tried</c><00:18:54.690><c> is</c><00:18:54.840><c> beyond</c><00:18:55.289><c> burger</c><00:18:55.919><c> not</c>

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
I've tried is beyond burger not
 

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
I've tried is beyond burger not
impossible<00:18:57.269><c> perhaps</c><00:18:57.659><c> that's</c><00:18:58.320><c> why</c><00:18:58.470><c> they</c><00:18:58.590><c> end</c>

00:18:58.639 --> 00:18:58.649 align:start position:0%
impossible perhaps that's why they end
 

00:18:58.649 --> 00:19:00.680 align:start position:0%

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
okay so with that so I yeah it was good
 

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.759 align:start position:0%

but<00:19:20.820><c> I</c><00:19:21.120><c> wouldn't</c><00:19:21.720><c> go</c><00:19:22.019><c> out</c><00:19:22.049><c> of</c><00:19:22.230><c> my</c><00:19:22.320><c> way</c><00:19:22.440><c> to</c><00:19:22.500><c> buy</c>

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:22.769 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy
 

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:24.529 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy
it<00:19:22.830><c> personally</c><00:19:23.549><c> but</c><00:19:23.970><c> if</c><00:19:24.149><c> you</c><00:19:24.330><c> were</c><00:19:24.510><c> a</c>

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
it personally but if you were a
 

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.810 align:start position:0%
it personally but if you were a
vegetarian<00:19:25.080><c> or</c><00:19:25.440><c> a</c><00:19:25.470><c> vegan</c><00:19:25.529><c> and</c><00:19:26.070><c> they</c><00:19:26.549><c> did</c><00:19:26.730><c> an</c>

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
vegetarian or a vegan and they did an
 

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.060 align:start position:0%
vegetarian or a vegan and they did an
alternative<00:19:27.419><c> then</c><00:19:27.659><c> that's</c><00:19:28.110><c> a</c><00:19:28.230><c> reasonable</c>

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.070 align:start position:0%
alternative then that's a reasonable
 

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.580 align:start position:0%
alternative then that's a reasonable
alternative<00:19:29.220><c> and</c><00:19:30.149><c> I</c><00:19:30.570><c> mean</c><00:19:30.750><c> if</c><00:19:30.960><c> in</c><00:19:31.320><c> China</c>

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:31.590 align:start position:0%
alternative and I mean if in China
 

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.009 align:start position:0%
alternative and I mean if in China
they're<00:19:31.799><c> having</c><00:19:32.100><c> a</c><00:19:32.220><c> big</c><00:19:32.610><c> pork</c><00:19:32.940><c> shortage</c><00:19:33.539><c> this</c>

00:19:34.009 --> 00:19:34.019 align:start position:0%
they're having a big pork shortage this
 

00:19:34.019 --> 00:19:38.090 align:start position:0%
they're having a big pork shortage this
is<00:19:34.200><c> it</c><00:19:34.409><c> and</c><00:19:34.740><c> they</c><00:19:35.669><c> use</c><00:19:35.940><c> full</c><00:19:36.330><c> flavor</c><00:19:37.100><c> dishes</c>

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
is it and they use full flavor dishes
 

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.549 align:start position:0%
is it and they use full flavor dishes
right<00:19:38.490><c> so</c><00:19:38.820><c> I</c><00:19:39.149><c> think</c><00:19:39.179><c> that</c><00:19:39.720><c> really</c><00:19:40.110><c> just</c>

00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
right so I think that really just
 

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.590 align:start position:0%
right so I think that really just
membership<00:19:41.220><c> mimicking</c><00:19:41.760><c> the</c><00:19:41.940><c> texture</c><00:19:42.419><c> is</c>

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
membership mimicking the texture is
 

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.860 align:start position:0%
membership mimicking the texture is
probably<00:19:43.049><c> all</c><00:19:43.940><c> it's</c><00:19:44.940><c> not</c><00:19:45.120><c> always</c><00:19:45.330><c> needed</c><00:19:45.600><c> like</c>

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:45.870 align:start position:0%
probably all it's not always needed like
 

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.629 align:start position:0%
probably all it's not always needed like
I<00:19:45.899><c> mean</c><00:19:46.139><c> if</c><00:19:46.260><c> you</c><00:19:46.350><c> have</c><00:19:46.559><c> some</c><00:19:47.070><c> soup</c><00:19:47.309><c> and</c><00:19:47.490><c> you</c>
