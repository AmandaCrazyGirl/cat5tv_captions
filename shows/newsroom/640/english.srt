they're leaving this takeover exploit

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:49,420
they're leaving this takeover exploit
 

165
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,020
they're leaving this takeover exploit
active in the wild for a good four weeks

167
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,830

or so at least these kinds of horrendous
 

169
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,380
or so at least these kinds of horrendous
security practices are another reminder

00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,390
security practices are another reminder
 

171
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,970
security practices are another reminder
of why we shouldn't be trusting

172
00:03:59,970 --> 00:03:59,980
of why we shouldn't be trusting
 

173
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,259
of why we shouldn't be trusting
Microsoft to provide our antivirus to

Microsoft to provide our antivirus to
 

175
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,330
Microsoft to provide our antivirus to
there is no practical reason to be

there is no practical reason to be

it's brutal yeah yeah Microsoft has been

192
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,080
it's brutal yeah yeah Microsoft has been
 

193
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,409
it's brutal yeah yeah Microsoft has been
continually letting us down Windows 10

00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:31,419
continually letting us down Windows 10
 

195
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,980
continually letting us down Windows 10
has been a nightmare as Microsoft to

196
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:34,990
has been a nightmare as Microsoft to
 

197
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,070
has been a nightmare as Microsoft to
ever not let us down I mean maybe back

like Windows 93 95 we can say that but I

200
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
like Windows 93 95 we can say that but I
 

201
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,340
like Windows 93 95 we can say that but I
mean it no it did feel like they were

202
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,350
mean it no it did feel like they were
 

203
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,279
mean it no it did feel like they were
giving it an effort but at one point

204
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,289
giving it an effort but at one point
 

205
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,820
giving it an effort but at one point
they had the bet a team they had the the

206
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:50,830
they had the bet a team they had the the
 

207
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,730
they had the bet a team they had the the
testing team before patches went out and

208
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:53,740
testing team before patches went out and
 

209
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,770
testing team before patches went out and
but stuff like this and having to wait

210
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:55,780
but stuff like this and having to wait
 

211
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,430
but stuff like this and having to wait
for weeks for it's actively exploited

212
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
for weeks for it's actively exploited
 

213
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,670
for weeks for it's actively exploited
yes yes that is a takeover bug like this

214
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:02,680
yes yes that is a takeover bug like this
 

215
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,290
yes yes that is a takeover bug like this
is something that could completely

216
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:04,300
is something that could completely
 

217
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,750
is something that could completely
compromise an entire network of machines

218
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:06,760
compromise an entire network of machines
 

219
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,040
compromise an entire network of machines
and so if somebody a miscreant knows of

220
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,050
and so if somebody a miscreant knows of
 

221
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,460
and so if somebody a miscreant knows of
the vulnerability within let's say a

222
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:14,470
the vulnerability within let's say a
 

223
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,150
the vulnerability within let's say a
business network and actively exploits

224
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
business network and actively exploits
 

225
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,520
business network and actively exploits
it because it is like understand folks

226
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,530
it because it is like understand folks
 

227
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,490
it because it is like understand folks
this is an exploit that is currently

228
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:23,500
this is an exploit that is currently
 

229
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,440
this is an exploit that is currently
being used by hackers to infiltrate

230
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,450
being used by hackers to infiltrate
 

231
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,239
being used by hackers to infiltrate
networks

232
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:29,249
networks
 

233
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:33,019
networks
is currently being used so if that's the

234
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:33,029
is currently being used so if that's the
 

235
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,539
is currently being used so if that's the
case wouldn't it be prudent for a

236
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:35,549
case wouldn't it be prudent for a
 

237
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:38,689
case wouldn't it be prudent for a
company like Microsoft to say we need to

238
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:38,699
company like Microsoft to say we need to
 

239
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,809
company like Microsoft to say we need to
fix this and we need to fix this now

240
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:41,819
fix this and we need to fix this now
 

241
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,889
fix this and we need to fix this now
yes instead they're waiting a month at

242
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:45,899
yes instead they're waiting a month at
 

243
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:48,919
yes instead they're waiting a month at
least at least four weeks I mean we're

244
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:48,929
least at least four weeks I mean we're
 

245
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:51,379
least at least four weeks I mean we're
talking the the second Tuesday of

246
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:51,389
talking the the second Tuesday of
 

247
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:55,639
talking the the second Tuesday of
February why four weeks though like wow

248
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:55,649
February why four weeks though like wow
 

249
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,889
February why four weeks though like wow
that's that's arbitrary it's just the

250
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:57,899
that's that's arbitrary it's just the
 

251
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,599
that's that's arbitrary it's just the
second Tuesday of every month is when

252
00:05:59,599 --> 00:05:59,609
second Tuesday of every month is when
 

253
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,729
second Tuesday of every month is when
they issue their patches well I get that

254
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:01,739
they issue their patches well I get that
 

255
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:05,739
they issue their patches well I get that
but yeah why not push through an update

256
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:05,749
but yeah why not push through an update
 

257
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,779
but yeah why not push through an update
because they don't because it's the

258
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:08,789
because they don't because it's the
 

259
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,779
because they don't because it's the
rollout happens on on that schedule they

260
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:11,789
rollout happens on on that schedule they
 

261
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,429
rollout happens on on that schedule they
this is the thing they've said it

262
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:13,439
this is the thing they've said it
 

263
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,679
this is the thing they've said it
they've set themselves up for this type

264
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:15,689
they've set themselves up for this type
 

265
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,619
they've set themselves up for this type
of failure see I their infrastructure is

266
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:18,629
of failure see I their infrastructure is
 

267
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,600
of failure see I their infrastructure is
set up for this type of failure now but

268
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,610
set up for this type of failure now but
 

269
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,859
set up for this type of failure now but
I don't know why they couldn't even just

270
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:21,869
I don't know why they couldn't even just
 

271
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,629
I don't know why they couldn't even just
post it to their website and say update

272
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:23,639
post it to their website and say update
 

273
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,059
post it to their website and say update
manually like nobody's gonna do it but

274
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:29,069
manually like nobody's gonna do it but
 

275
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:33,679
manually like nobody's gonna do it but
if you unless you know but even if you

276
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:33,689
if you unless you know but even if you
 

277
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:37,009
if you unless you know but even if you
know that that patch exists imagine if

278
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:37,019
know that that patch exists imagine if
 

279
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:38,989
know that that patch exists imagine if
you had a hundred computers and you had

280
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:38,999
you had a hundred computers and you had
 

281
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,149
you had a hundred computers and you had
to manually go like Windows

282
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:41,159
to manually go like Windows
 

283
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,399
to manually go like Windows
infrastructure right now is a brutal

284
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:43,409
infrastructure right now is a brutal
 

285
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:46,159
infrastructure right now is a brutal
nightmare that's true it's just

286
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,169
nightmare that's true it's just
 

287
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,039
nightmare that's true it's just
ridiculous and it's really causing

288
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:49,049
ridiculous and it's really causing
 

289
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,079
ridiculous and it's really causing
companies I especially companies that

290
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,089
companies I especially companies that
 

291
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,269
companies I especially companies that
are currently stuck on window like that

292
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:53,279
are currently stuck on window like that
 

293
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,399
are currently stuck on window like that
have Windows 7 machines intermixed in

294
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:55,409
have Windows 7 machines intermixed in
 

295
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,979
have Windows 7 machines intermixed in
their network yeah a lot of government

296
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:57,989
their network yeah a lot of government
 

297
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:01,309
their network yeah a lot of government
agencies and we're looking at okay well

298
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:01,319
agencies and we're looking at okay well
 

299
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,189
agencies and we're looking at okay well
what do we do next do we buy all new

300
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:04,199
what do we do next do we buy all new
 

301
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,129
what do we do next do we buy all new
systems so we can install Windows 10

302
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:06,139
systems so we can install Windows 10
 

303
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,739
systems so we can install Windows 10
because that's usually necessary unless

304
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:09,749
because that's usually necessary unless
 

305
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,779
because that's usually necessary unless
you can maybe put more RAM in them

306
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:11,789
you can maybe put more RAM in them
 

307
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,069
you can maybe put more RAM in them
because you're gonna need at least like

308
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:13,079
because you're gonna need at least like
 

309
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,709
because you're gonna need at least like
twice as much RAM you're gonna need an

00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:15,719
twice as much RAM you're gonna need an
 

311
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,319
twice as much RAM you're gonna need an
SSD to you know make it yeah like you're

312
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:18,329
SSD to you know make it yeah like you're
 

313
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:19,489
SSD to you know make it yeah like you're
gonna need to upgrade you're not gonna

314
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:19,499
gonna need to upgrade you're not gonna
 

315
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,529
gonna need to upgrade you're not gonna
be using a five year old computer for

be using a five year old computer for
 

317
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,419
be using a five year old computer for
Windows 10 that's for sure though at

318
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:23,429
Windows 10 that's for sure though at
 

319
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:24,679
Windows 10 that's for sure though at
least not without a couple of little

understand all they're doing is taking
 

1229
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,870
understand all they're doing is taking
t---cell that you already produce outs

t---cell that you already produce outs
 

1231
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,540
t---cell that you already produce outs
and they're just replicating it like

1232
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,550
and they're just replicating it like
 

1233
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,550
and they're just replicating it like
they're kind of growing more their own

1234
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:24,560
they're kind of growing more their own
 

1235
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,870
they're kind of growing more their own
they're altering it to put in the

1236
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:25,880
they're altering it to put in the
 

1237
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,210
they're altering it to put in the
receptor to find the cancer cells so

1238
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:28,220
receptor to find the cancer cells so
 

1239
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,040
receptor to find the cancer cells so
that's a bit of a genetic modification

1240
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,050
that's a bit of a genetic modification
 

1241
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,230
that's a bit of a genetic modification
and then they're culturing more so there

1242
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
and then they're culturing more so there
 

1243
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,660
and then they're culturing more so there
can't be adverse reactions because it's

1244
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:34,670
can't be adverse reactions because it's
 

1245
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,260
can't be adverse reactions because it's
your own sure I mean I don't understand

1246
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,270
your own sure I mean I don't understand
 

1247
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,670
your own sure I mean I don't understand
the science like yeah pretend to

1248
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:39,680
the science like yeah pretend to
 

1249
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,980
the science like yeah pretend to
understand the science but I know there

1250
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:41,990
understand the science but I know there
 

1251
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,910
understand the science but I know there
was a time in our history when

1252
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:44,920
was a time in our history when
 

1253
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,400
was a time in our history when
penicillin didn't exist and when and

1254
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,410
penicillin didn't exist and when and
 

1255
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,640
penicillin didn't exist and when and
when it was discovered if you will it

1256
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:51,650
when it was discovered if you will it
 

1257
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,040
when it was discovered if you will it
was a mistake yeah but so when it was

1258
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,050
was a mistake yeah but so when it was
 

1259
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,130
was a mistake yeah but so when it was
