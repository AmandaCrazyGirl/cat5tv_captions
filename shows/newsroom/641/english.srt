00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,360
switch all the way now right now yeah
yeah I'd say the switch is where it's at

790
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:12,370
yeah I'd say the switch is where it's at
 

791
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,789
yeah I'd say the switch is where it's at
so I will say that we had to install

792
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:17,799
so I will say that we had to install
 

793
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,720
so I will say that we had to install
window windows on early for gaming

794
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:21,730
window windows on early for gaming
 

795
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,760
window windows on early for gaming
because of gaming yeah because you got

796
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:23,770
because of gaming yeah because you got
 

797
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,439
because of gaming yeah because you got
the VR headset and everything yeah yes

798
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:25,449
the VR headset and everything yeah yes
 

799
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,870
the VR headset and everything yeah yes
that makes sense that's why I have

800
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:27,880
that makes sense that's why I have
 

801
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,940
that makes sense that's why I have
Windows on my computer like I have steam

802
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,950

with my turkey nerd games on it yeah
 

805
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,070
with my turkey nerd games on it yeah
fair enough and so for that reason that

806
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,080
fair enough and so for that reason that
 

807
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,960
fair enough and so for that reason that
I need nails can I have access to your

you typically don't see gamers running
 

821
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,220
you typically don't see gamers running
on Linux and here's the thing I wish

822
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,230
on Linux and here's the thing I wish
 

823
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,590
on Linux and here's the thing I wish
that it was a big deal I wish that there

824
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
that it was a big deal I wish that there
 

825
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,580
that it was a big deal I wish that there
was more of a wave toward Linux sure

826
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:05,590
was more of a wave toward Linux sure
 

827
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,240
was more of a wave toward Linux sure
face yeah we but you're looking at it in

828
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,250
face yeah we but you're looking at it in
 

829
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,260

now yep not a lot of gamers on Linux ok

832
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:15,940
now yep not a lot of gamers on Linux ok
 

833
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,090
now yep not a lot of gamers on Linux ok
so think about this well the products

834
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,100
so think about this well the products
 

835
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,990
so think about this well the products
already on Linux

836
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,000

like what so the point of this is just
 

1063
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,500
like what so the point of this is just
cuz you see it on Google Earth doesn't

1064
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,510
cuz you see it on Google Earth doesn't
 

1065
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,540
cuz you see it on Google Earth doesn't
mean it is what you think it is that's

1066
