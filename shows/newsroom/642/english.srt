is apples to oranges but what I mean is

480
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:24,760
is apples to oranges but what I mean is
 

481
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,420
is apples to oranges but what I mean is
the power of that more powerful system

482
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:28,430
the power of that more powerful system
 

483
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,730
the power of that more powerful system
even though my TV never changed

484
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:30,740
even though my TV never changed
 

485
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,990
even though my TV never changed
resolution it's still the same

486
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
resolution it's still the same
 

487
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,560
resolution it's still the same
resolution the video quality is still

488
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,570
resolution the video quality is still
 

489
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,500
resolution the video quality is still
the same right okay but it looks so much

490
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,510
the same right okay but it looks so much
 

491
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,110
the same right okay but it looks so much
better because that one is so much more

492
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
better because that one is so much more
 

493
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,170
better because that one is so much more
powerful so now take that and put it

494
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,180
powerful so now take that and put it
 

495
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,110
powerful so now take that and put it
into a cloud server where this cloud

496
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
into a cloud server where this cloud
 

497
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,260
into a cloud server where this cloud
server is still streaming 1920 by 1080 P

498
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,270
server is still streaming 1920 by 1080 P
 

499
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:57,040
server is still streaming 1920 by 1080 P
2 to my 1080p TV and yet it has so much

500
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,050
2 to my 1080p TV and yet it has so much
 

501
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,830
2 to my 1080p TV and yet it has so much
power yes it's a multibillion-dollar

502
00:11:59,830 --> 00:11:59,840
power yes it's a multibillion-dollar
 

503
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,330
power yes it's a multibillion-dollar
system

504
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:01,340
system
 

505
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,450
system
versus my little $400 right console

506
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:04,460
versus my little $400 right console
 

507
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,470
versus my little $400 right console
right so so the the the resolution is

508
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
right so so the the the resolution is
 

509
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,850
right so so the the the resolution is
not the bottleneck now our our Internet

510
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:12,860
not the bottleneck now our our Internet
 

511
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,940
not the bottleneck now our our Internet
is capable of streaming 4k video in real

512
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:15,950
is capable of streaming 4k video in real
 

513
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,950
is capable of streaming 4k video in real
time with no latency right that's

514
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:17,960
time with no latency right that's
 

515
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,740
time with no latency right that's
incredible mm-hmm so now put it back and

516
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:20,750
incredible mm-hmm so now put it back and
 

517
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,470
incredible mm-hmm so now put it back and
in there that is so powerful that I can

518
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,480
in there that is so powerful that I can
 

519
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,690
in there that is so powerful that I can
do that on my cheap device yeah and on

520
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:25,700
do that on my cheap device yeah and on
 

521
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,760
do that on my cheap device yeah and on
any device and I can transition from

522
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:27,770
any device and I can transition from
 

523
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,100
any device and I can transition from
device to device I don't have to buy

524
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,110
device to device I don't have to buy

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:32,690
anything in particular to be able to use
 

527
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,530
anything in particular to be able to use
my games and the transition is happening

528
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:35,540
my games and the transition is happening
 

529
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,850
my games and the transition is happening
but the transitions gonna be difficult

530
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:36,860
but the transitions gonna be difficult
 

531
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,070
but the transitions gonna be difficult
for people like me who still like to go

532
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,080
for people like me who still like to go
 

533
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,980
for people like me who still like to go
to the store and buy a game and you and

534
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:41,990
to the store and buy a game and you and
 

535
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,370
to the store and buy a game and you and
I actually kind of and if they business

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,380
I actually kind of and if they business
 

537
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,270
I actually kind of and if they business
you take it with you and put it up I

538
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,280
you take it with you and put it up I
 

539
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,740
you take it with you and put it up I
hesitate even buying digital copies of

540
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:50,750
hesitate even buying digital copies of
 

541
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,380
hesitate even buying digital copies of
games like I like to have the actual

542
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,390
games like I like to have the actual
 

543
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,800
games like I like to have the actual
game but I understand that the future is

544
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:56,810
game but I understand that the future is
 

545
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,800
game but I understand that the future is
is coming up quick and I'm still gonna

546
00:12:59,800 --> 00:12:59,810
is coming up quick and I'm still gonna
 

547
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,250
is coming up quick and I'm still gonna
buy a PS 5 but I'm gonna also likely

548
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,260
buy a PS 5 but I'm gonna also likely
 

549
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,530
buy a PS 5 but I'm gonna also likely
play games on stadia right yeah and

550
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:05,540
play games on stadia right yeah and
 

551
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,390
play games on stadia right yeah and
that's that's an interesting point I

552
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:07,400
that's that's an interesting point I
 

553
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,730
that's that's an interesting point I
want to just reiterate what you just

554
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:09,740
want to just reiterate what you just
 

555
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,300
want to just reiterate what you just
said which is I'm going to also play

556
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,310
said which is I'm going to also play
 

557
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,330
said which is I'm going to also play
video games on stadia stadia so I don't

558
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,340
video games on stadia stadia so I don't
 

559
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,730
video games on stadia stadia so I don't
think that we're replacing that offline

560
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:18,740
think that we're replacing that offline
 

561
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,720
think that we're replacing that offline
phone device

562
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:19,730
phone device
 

563
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,190
phone device
I think we're supplementing it and say

564
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
I think we're supplementing it and say
 

565
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,160
I think we're supplementing it and say
enhance hey now okay you can you can

566
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,170
enhance hey now okay you can you can
 

567
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,600
enhance hey now okay you can you can
also when you're connected to the

568
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,610
also when you're connected to the
 

569
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,670
also when you're connected to the
internet play games that you can't play

570
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
internet play games that you can't play
 

571
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,260
internet play games that you can't play
when you're offline that are like

572
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,270
when you're offline that are like
 

573
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,930
when you're offline that are like
high-end yeah and that's where okay

574
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:31,940
high-end yeah and that's where okay
 

575
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,820
high-end yeah and that's where okay
maybe this is just another another

576
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:33,830
maybe this is just another another
 

577
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,610
maybe this is just another another
platform and we all have multiple plans

578
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:36,620
platform and we all have multiple plans
 

579
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,360
platform and we all have multiple plans
I wonder if they'll have it like now

580
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,370
I wonder if they'll have it like now
 

581
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,030
I wonder if they'll have it like now
here's the latency is too high for VR

582
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
here's the latency is too high for VR
 

583
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,130
here's the latency is too high for VR
here's an island I've got to be able

584
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,140
here's an island I've got to be able
 

585
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,450
here's an island I've got to be able
it's gotta be able to track you with

586
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,460
it's gotta be able to track you with
 

587
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,180
it's gotta be able to track you with
this right now so I mean like you've

588
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,190
this right now so I mean like you've
 

589
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,910
this right now so I mean like you've
brought up VR which you know totally

590
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
brought up VR which you know totally
 

591
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,180
brought up VR which you know totally
makes up our future yes what about

592
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,190
makes up our future yes what about
 

593
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,860
makes up our future yes what about
things like framerate

594
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:57,870
things like framerate
 

595
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,590
things like framerate
because you said p4k that's pretty good

596
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:00,600
because you said p4k that's pretty good
 

597
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,160
because you said p4k that's pretty good
to me no but no I I hear you you're

598
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,170
to me no but no I I hear you you're
 

599
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,450
to me no but no I I hear you you're
talking about the screen resolution I

600
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:05,460
talking about the screen resolution I
 

601
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,810
talking about the screen resolution I
mean if your internet can't keep up it's

602
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:08,820
mean if your internet can't keep up it's
 

603
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,280
mean if your internet can't keep up it's
gonna impact your gameplay sure do you

604
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,290
gonna impact your gameplay sure do you
 

605
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,870
gonna impact your gameplay sure do you
remember when we used to be like oh I'm

606
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:11,880
remember when we used to be like oh I'm
 

607
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,500
remember when we used to be like oh I'm
like I'm so bad yeah like in order to go

608
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:15,510
like I'm so bad yeah like in order to go
 

609

like I'm so bad yeah like in order to go
back to lagging or my car my kids gonna

610
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,370
back to lagging or my car my kids gonna
 

611
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,070
back to lagging or my car my kids gonna
go yes however consider this as and I

612
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,080
go yes however consider this as and I
 

613
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,720
go yes however consider this as and I
know we do need to move on to the next

614
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:23,730
know we do need to move on to the next
 

615
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,940
know we do need to move on to the next
story but consider that the very

616
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:25,950
story but consider that the very
 

617
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,680
story but consider that the very
companies that are pushing the

618
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:27,690
companies that are pushing the
 

619
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,770
companies that are pushing the
technology shift are the same companies

620
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:30,780
technology shift are the same companies
 

621
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,860
technology shift are the same companies
who are controlling the introduction of

622
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:33,870
who are controlling the introduction of
 

623
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,530
who are controlling the introduction of
like Google's gigabit fiber to the home

624
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:36,540
like Google's gigabit fiber to the home
 

625
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,580
like Google's gigabit fiber to the home
right right so yeah if that's the case

626
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:40,590
right right so yeah if that's the case
 

627
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,950
right right so yeah if that's the case
oh you know it's gonna perform well it's

628
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:42,960
oh you know it's gonna perform well it's
 

629
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,380
oh you know it's gonna perform well it's
like you you you just know that that's

630
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,390
like you you you just know that that's
 

631
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,200
like you you you just know that that's
what they're driving toward and and

I don't know what it really is but it's
 

1093
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,960
I don't know what it really is but it's
like ridiculous amounts of data having

like ridiculous amounts of data having
 

1095
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,750
like ridiculous amounts of data having
to do with AI right so that so the the

1096
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
to do with AI right so that so the the
 

1097
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,340
to do with AI right so that so the the
next thing is that the you know coders

1098
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,350
next thing is that the you know coders
 

1099
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,360
next thing is that the you know coders
will be able to make thinking devices so

00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:07,409
those smart speakers with this and with
 

1103
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:11,210
those smart speakers with this and with
this technology will be smarter is the

1104
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,220
this technology will be smarter is the
 

1105
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,710
this technology will be smarter is the
fact that there are two separate things

1106
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
fact that there are two separate things
 

1107
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,930
fact that there are two separate things
like I'm surprised that well you have to

1108
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:14,940
like I'm surprised that well you have to
 

1109
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,669
like I'm surprised that well you have to
have a CPU you have to have the ability

1110
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:16,679
have a CPU you have to have the ability
 

1111
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,490
have a CPU you have to have the ability
to run traditional code yeah otherwise

1112
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:19,500
to run traditional code yeah otherwise
 

1113
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,720
to run traditional code yeah otherwise
you wouldn't be able to like you

1114
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:20,730
you wouldn't be able to like you
 

1115
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,519
you wouldn't be able to like you
wouldn't be able to as a human interact

1116
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:22,529
wouldn't be able to as a human interact
 

1117
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,409
wouldn't be able to as a human interact
with it there has to be a layer for

1118
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:24,419
with it there has to be a layer for
 

1119
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,560
with it there has to be a layer for
humans to be able to access the NPU yeah

1120
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:27,570
humans to be able to access the NPU yeah
 

1121
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,299
humans to be able to access the NPU yeah
hmm otherwise it just blow our minds how

1122
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:32,309
hmm otherwise it just blow our minds how
 

1123
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,039

but I mean at this level

1128
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,080
but I mean at this level
 

1129
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,320

I don't know like because that could
 

1131
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,890
I don't know like because that could
change mobile computing sure it's gonna

1132
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:46,900

1133
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,200
change mobile computing sure it's gonna
change a lot of thoughts the idea is

1134
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,210
change a lot of thoughts the idea is
 

1135
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,930
change a lot of thoughts the idea is
that it's getting faster smaller yeah

1136
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:51,940
that it's getting faster smaller yeah
 

1137
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,660
that it's getting faster smaller yeah
and more integrated that's the way

1138
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:54,670
and more integrated that's the way
 

1139
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,880

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:38,380
instance of this type of hack it is it
 

1261
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,250
instance of this type of hack it is it
very well may not be the last and points

1262
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,260
very well may not be the last and points
 

1263
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,919
very well may not be the last and points
to a need for Microsoft to reassess the

1264
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:43,929
to a need for Microsoft to reassess the
 

1265
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:45,950
to a need for Microsoft to reassess the
way their certificate revocation

1266
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:45,960
way their certificate revocation
 

1267
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,440
way their certificate revocation
procedures hmm

1268
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:48,450
procedures hmm
 

1269
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,140
procedures hmm
that's tough mm-hmm because the part of

1270
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,150
that's tough mm-hmm because the part of
 

1271
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,330
that's tough mm-hmm because the part of
me wants to say Oh we'll just revoke the

1272
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:54,340
me wants to say Oh we'll just revoke the
 

1273
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,700
me wants to say Oh we'll just revoke the
certificate anytime there's an exploit

1274
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:56,710
certificate anytime there's an exploit
 

1275
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,860
certificate anytime there's an exploit
but remember that then that would

1276
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:58,870
but remember that then that would
 

1277
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:04,590
but remember that then that would
nullify everybody's drivers right so

1278
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:04,600
nullify everybody's drivers right so
 

1279
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,710
nullify everybody's drivers right so
this is all mole I mean as I'm hearing

1280
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:07,720
this is all mole I mean as I'm hearing
 

1281
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,370
this is all mole I mean as I'm hearing
it this is like a new wave of Trojan

1282
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:11,380
it this is like a new wave of Trojan
 

1283
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,530
it this is like a new wave of Trojan
attack so to speak yeah that's what it

1284
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:13,540
attack so to speak yeah that's what it
 

1285
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:18,200
attack so to speak yeah that's what it
feels like like you're coming in through

1286
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,210
feels like like you're coming in through
 

1287
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,970
feels like like you're coming in through
yeah trusted source to get access is

1288
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:20,980
yeah trusted source to get access is
 

1289
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,720
yeah trusted source to get access is
that not the basic principle of behind

1290
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:24,730
that not the basic principle of behind
 

1291
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,780
that not the basic principle of behind
it or is it a whole different wave just

1292
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:27,790
it or is it a whole different wave just
 

1293
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,030
it or is it a whole different wave just
feels like so they're using it as an

1294
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,040
feels like so they're using it as an
 

1295
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,880
feels like so they're using it as an
elevated privilege tactic so they're

1296
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:32,890
elevated privilege tactic so they're
 

1297
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:37,680
elevated privilege tactic so they're
using a driver that windows trusts

1298
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:37,690
using a driver that windows trusts
 

1299
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,789
using a driver that windows trusts
because of the signature being valid so

1300
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:41,799
because of the signature being valid so
 

1301
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,740
because of the signature being valid so
it's not a fake driver it's not like a

1302
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:43,750
it's not a fake driver it's not like a
 

1303
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,770
it's not a fake driver it's not like a
malware it is a legitimate driver but it

1304
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:46,780
malware it is a legitimate driver but it
 

1305
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,289
malware it is a legitimate driver but it
has a bug in it mm-hmm that caused it to

1306
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:49,299
has a bug in it mm-hmm that caused it to
 

1307
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,230
has a bug in it mm-hmm that caused it to
be recalled basically but the Windows

1308
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
be recalled basically but the Windows
 

1309
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,820
be recalled basically but the Windows
operating system no matter what version

1310
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:53,830
operating system no matter what version
 

1311
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,310
operating system no matter what version
you're running still trusts the

1312
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
you're running still trusts the
 

1313
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,530
you're running still trusts the
Installer for that driver because of the

1314
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:58,540
Installer for that driver because of the
 

1315
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,500
Installer for that driver because of the
certificate that is applied to it

1316
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,510
certificate that is applied to it
 

1317
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,200
certificate that is applied to it
and so the hackers are using that to

1318
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,210
and so the hackers are using that to
 

1319
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,210
and so the hackers are using that to
then be able to elevate their privileges

1320
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:06,220
then be able to elevate their privileges
 

1321
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,770
then be able to elevate their privileges
and do whatever the heck they want and

1322
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:07,780
and do whatever the heck they want and
 

1323
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,500
and do whatever the heck they want and
that's the scary thing because how do

1324
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:10,510
that's the scary thing because how do
 

1325
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,470
that's the scary thing because how do
you stop that how can you possibly stop

1326
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:13,480
you stop that how can you possibly stop
 

1327
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,430
you stop that how can you possibly stop
that I think it comes down to where's

1328
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
that I think it comes down to where's
 

1329
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,890
that I think it comes down to where's
your first line of defense I think the

1330
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:19,900
your first line of defense I think the
 

1331
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,600
your first line of defense I think the
only thing you have to that you can look

1332
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:21,610
only thing you have to that you can look
 

1333
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,490
only thing you have to that you can look
at is how did they get in in the first

1334
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:23,500
at is how did they get in in the first
 

1335
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,920
at is how did they get in in the first
place was it a phishing scam was it

1336
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,930
place was it a phishing scam was it
 

1337
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,690
place was it a phishing scam was it
somebody clicked on an email that had

1338
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:27,700
somebody clicked on an email that had
 

1339
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,130
somebody clicked on an email that had
some file list malware that allowed

some file list malware that allowed
 

1341
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,810
some file list malware that allowed
somebody to run something resident in

their computer is it that you have

1344
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:32,500
their computer is it that you have
 

1345
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,040
their computer is it that you have
Remote Desktop turned on on one of your

1346
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,050
Remote Desktop turned on on one of your
 

1347
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,990
Remote Desktop turned on on one of your
computers on your network and that's

1348
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,000
computers on your network and that's
 

1349
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,510
computers on your network and that's
really easy to hack now I don't know how

1350
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:39,520
really easy to hack now I don't know how
 

1351
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,850
really easy to hack now I don't know how
certificates work just because I haven't

1352
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:41,860
certificates work just because I haven't
 

1353
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,590
certificates work just because I haven't
delved into that but does each

1354
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:43,600
delved into that but does each
 

1355
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,630
delved into that but does each
certificate you need to drive or have

1356
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,640
certificate you need to drive or have
 

1357
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,530
certificate you need to drive or have
its own like a certificate identifier no

1358
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:49,540
its own like a certificate identifier no
 

1359
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,360
its own like a certificate identifier no
the driver doesn't have its own

1360
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:51,370
the driver doesn't have its own
 

1361
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,430
the driver doesn't have its own
certificate but the company that

1362
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
certificate but the company that
 

1363
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,860
certificate but the company that
manufactures the driver does so that

1364
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:55,870
manufactures the driver does so that
 

1365
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,000
manufactures the driver does so that
certificate says yes to Microsoft this

1366
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,010
certificate says yes to Microsoft this
 

1367
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,770
certificate says yes to Microsoft this
is a gigabyte driver provided by

1368
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:04,780
is a gigabyte driver provided by
 

1369
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,570
is a gigabyte driver provided by
gigabyte because it contains the

1370
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:06,580
gigabyte because it contains the
 

1371
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,180
gigabyte because it contains the
certificate that proves that this is a

1372
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,190
certificate that proves that this is a
 

1373
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,490
certificate that proves that this is a
legitimate driver from gigabyte so what

1374
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:11,500
legitimate driver from gigabyte so what
 

1375
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
legitimate driver from gigabyte so what
if the certificate system changed in

1376
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,510
if the certificate system changed in
 

1377
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,290
if the certificate system changed in
such a way that you have your your main

1378
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:16,300
such a way that you have your your main
 

1379
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,510
such a way that you have your your main
certificate say for gigabyte but then

1380
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:18,520
certificate say for gigabyte but then
 

1381
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,070
certificate say for gigabyte but then
you have your sub certificates for each

1382
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
you have your sub certificates for each
 

1383
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,330
you have your sub certificates for each
driver roll out so that

1384
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,340
driver roll out so that
 

1385
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,960
driver roll out so that
it identifies this drivers this subset

1386
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:26,970
it identifies this drivers this subset
 

1387
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,850
it identifies this drivers this subset
yeah developer I feel like that's your

1388
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:31,860
yeah developer I feel like that's your
 

1389
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,650
yeah developer I feel like that's your
you're giving me nightmares right now

1390
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:33,660
you're giving me nightmares right now
 

1391
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,480
you're giving me nightmares right now
Jeff like where you're going but it just

1392
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,490
Jeff like where you're going but it just
 

1393
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,550
Jeff like where you're going but it just
sounds like a logistical nightmare as

1394
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:40,560
sounds like a logistical nightmare as
 

1395
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,320
sounds like a logistical nightmare as
far as managing those certificates like

1396
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,330
far as managing those certificates like
 

1397
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,150
far as managing those certificates like
it could just be a nightmare I think

1398
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,160
it could just be a nightmare I think
 

1399
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,530
it could just be a nightmare I think
maybe some kind of an aristocrat is able

1400
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:48,540
maybe some kind of an aristocrat is able
 

1401
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,410
maybe some kind of an aristocrat is able
to identify maybe it's a checksum that

1402
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:51,420
to identify maybe it's a checksum that
 

1403
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,200
to identify maybe it's a checksum that
identifies known faulty drivers or

1404
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,210
identifies known faulty drivers or
 

1405
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,540
identifies known faulty drivers or
deprecated drivers so that windows could

1406
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:56,550
deprecated drivers so that windows could
 

1407
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,860
deprecated drivers so that windows could
say yes this is a valid certificate

1408
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:57,870
say yes this is a valid certificate
 

1409
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,920
say yes this is a valid certificate
however gigabyte has marked this

1410
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:00,930
however gigabyte has marked this
 

1411
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,960
however gigabyte has marked this
certificate or this installer as bad

1412
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:04,970
certificate or this installer as bad
 

1413
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,920
certificate or this installer as bad
it's got to be some kind of an

1414
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:06,930
it's got to be some kind of an
 

1415
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:14,480
it's got to be some kind of an
