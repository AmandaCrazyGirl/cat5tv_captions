00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:29,889
this is all the stuff that we were
 

363
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,650
this is all the stuff that we were
talking about in the 80s like this is

talking about in the 80s like this is
 

365
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,510
talking about in the 80s like this is
not something you can really patent

not something you can really patent
 

367
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,060

when wanna cry dropped and we started
 

665
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,860
when wanna cry dropped and we started
seeing ransomware infiltrating networks

666
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:10,870
seeing ransomware infiltrating networks
 

667
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,900
seeing ransomware infiltrating networks
and we started seeing RDP attacks and

and we started seeing RDP attacks and
 

669
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,290

673
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,990
all of these kinds of things that's when
the cybersecurity industry woke up and

674
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
the cybersecurity industry woke up and
 

675
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
the cybersecurity industry woke up and
said okay we need to re-educate

676
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,290
said okay we need to re-educate
 

677
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,860
said okay we need to re-educate
ourselves and if we haven't since then

big industries are getting hit because
 

709

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
now I know we have to get to the next
 

733
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,880
now I know we have to get to the next
story but as part of this a budgetary

734
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:30,890
story but as part of this a budgetary
 

735
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,920
story but as part of this a budgetary
component sure like they're looking at

736
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:32,930
component sure like they're looking at
 

737
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,420
component sure like they're looking at
it go ahead we can only put in one

738
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,430
it go ahead we can only put in one
 

739
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,980
it go ahead we can only put in one

when really they should be looking at 10

742
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,089
when really they should be looking at 10
 

743
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:40,540
when really they should be looking at 10
percent like not that there's a defined

744
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,550
percent like not that there's a defined
 

745
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,940
percent like not that there's a defined
number but like the way that things grow

746
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:42,950
number but like the way that things grow
 

747
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,650
number but like the way that things grow
it's like you have to grow with the

748
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:44,660
it's like you have to grow with the
 

749
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,720
it's like you have to grow with the
threats and if that means allocating

750
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:46,730
threats and if that means allocating
 

751
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,949
threats and if that means allocating
more of your budget to more

more of your budget to more

of 8% of his fortune that he will go yes

968
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:37,169
of 8% of his fortune that he will go yes
 

969
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:41,569
of 8% of his fortune that he will go yes
that will go toward those that research

970
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:41,579
that will go toward those that research
 

971
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,430
that will go toward those that research
and things that could potentially make a

972
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
and things that could potentially make a
 

973
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,719
and things that could potentially make a
very large impact on a positive shift in

974
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:47,729
very large impact on a positive shift in
 

975
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:50,359
very large impact on a positive shift in
an environmental impact I also wonder if

976
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:50,369
an environmental impact I also wonder if
 

977
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:57,799
an environmental impact I also wonder if
part of it is a as a taxation even if it

978
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:57,809
part of it is a as a taxation even if it
 

979

just changes the focus for people going
 

981
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,319
just changes the focus for people going
oh wait climate change is that important

982
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:03,329
oh wait climate change is that important
 

983
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:08,810
oh wait climate change is that important
it is asking that question now saying

984
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:08,820
it is asking that question now saying
 

985
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,940
it is asking that question now saying
like if he if he's saying yes this is

986
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:10,950
like if he if he's saying yes this is
 

987
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,069
like if he if he's saying yes this is
important enough to me that I'm going to

988
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:13,079
important enough to me that I'm going to
 

989
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,619
important enough to me that I'm going to
put this money towards it then then

990
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:15,629
put this money towards it then then
 

991
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:17,959
put this money towards it then then
that's kind that becomes the the news

992
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:17,969
that's kind that becomes the the news
 

993
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,810
that's kind that becomes the the news
and then more people are focused on the

994
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:20,820
and then more people are focused on the
 

995
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,299
and then more people are focused on the
climate change issue and now there'll be

996
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:23,309
climate change issue and now there'll be
 

997
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,249
climate change issue and now there'll be
more creative minds thinking about it

998
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:25,259
more creative minds thinking about it
 

999
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,549

not using on a shared device but I think
 

1231
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,799
not using on a shared device but I think
for a lot of people know on a home

you're viewing on your phone like I
 

1241
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:36,490
you're viewing on your phone like I
think that that likely 30 days is the

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:36,500
think that that likely 30 days is the
 

1243
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,740
think that that likely 30 days is the

00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,720

more frequent I would hold on I mean I

1246
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:40,730
more frequent I would hold on I mean I
 

1247

00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:47,419
every time I think also though you're
 

1253
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:51,700
every time I think also though you're
putting a local spin on the security
