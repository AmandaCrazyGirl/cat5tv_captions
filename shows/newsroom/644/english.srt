have it so encryption I mean use like

652
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:55,980
have it so encryption I mean use like
 

653
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,249
have it so encryption I mean use like

question becomes okay so think about it

722
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:43,340
question becomes okay so think about it
 

723
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,190
question becomes okay so think about it
where are your keys okay so if you

724
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
where are your keys okay so if you
 

725
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,899
where are your keys okay so if you
collect cryptocurrency where are your

726
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:46,909
collect cryptocurrency where are your
 

727
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:47,350
collect cryptocurrency where are your
keys

728
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
keys
 

729
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
keys
how are they safe do you have a device

730
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:49,850
how are they safe do you have a device
 

731
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,930
how are they safe do you have a device
like a data traveler 2000 from Kingston

732
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:52,940
like a data traveler 2000 from Kingston
 

733
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,890
like a data traveler 2000 from Kingston
I have one and if not get one okay

734
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:56,900
I have one and if not get one okay
 

735
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,820
I have one and if not get one okay
because this is a great device

736
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:57,830
because this is a great device
 

737
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,980
because this is a great device
two-storey keys on but I wouldn't just I

738
00:18:59,980 --> 00:18:59,990
two-storey keys on but I wouldn't just I
 

739
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,890
two-storey keys on but I wouldn't just I
wouldn't just put my files on here I

740
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:02,900
wouldn't just put my files on here I
 

741
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,840
wouldn't just put my files on here I
would also encrypt those files with GPG

742
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:04,850
would also encrypt those files with GPG
 

743
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,510
would also encrypt those files with GPG
right so you've got multiple layers of

744
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
right so you've got multiple layers of
 

745
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,909
right so you've got multiple layers of
encryption and heck if you want to Luc's

746
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
encryption and heck if you want to Luc's
 

747
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,520
encryption and heck if you want to Luc's
encrypt this as well triple layer

748
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:12,530
encrypt this as well triple layer
 

749
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,529
encrypt this as well triple layer
encryption that's fine and then you can

750
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:14,539
encryption that's fine and then you can
 

751
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,500
encryption that's fine and then you can
back that up to multiple devices create

752
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:17,510
back that up to multiple devices create
 

753
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,470
back that up to multiple devices create
a DD image I don't care what you do but

754
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
a DD image I don't care what you do but
 

755
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,210
a DD image I don't care what you do but
you need to have a backup of your keys

756
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,220
you need to have a backup of your keys
 

757
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,570
you need to have a backup of your keys
yes and an offline key does not

758
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:25,580
yes and an offline key does not
 

759
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,070
yes and an offline key does not
necessarily mean that there's only one

760
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,080
necessarily mean that there's only one
 

761
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,580
necessarily mean that there's only one
copy no you can still have backups but I

762
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,590
copy no you can still have backups but I
 

763
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,419
copy no you can still have backups but I
think that is safer than the paper key

764
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:33,429
think that is safer than the paper key
 

765
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:35,770
think that is safer than the paper key
because the paper key can be picked up

766
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:35,780
because the paper key can be picked up
 

767
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,600
because the paper key can be picked up
by anyone so that robber if he

768
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,610
by anyone so that robber if he
 

769
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,310
by anyone so that robber if he
recognized it and he also had the

770
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:39,320
recognized it and he also had the
 

771
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,430
recognized it and he also had the
wallets I'm saying he I'm just assuming

772
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:42,440
wallets I'm saying he I'm just assuming
 

773
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,870
wallets I'm saying he I'm just assuming
it was probably a woman but if the

774
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
it was probably a woman but if the
 

775
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,500
it was probably a woman but if the
robber was to get a hold of the keys the

776
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,510
robber was to get a hold of the keys the
 

777
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,430
robber was to get a hold of the keys the
private keys on paper as well as the

778
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,440
private keys on paper as well as the
 

779
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,140
private keys on paper as well as the
wallets well they've got all your 69

780
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,150
wallets well they've got all your 69
 

781
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,899
wallets well they've got all your 69
billion dollars whatever it is a lot of

782
00:19:58,899 --> 00:19:58,909
billion dollars whatever it is a lot of
 

783
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,930
billion dollars whatever it is a lot of
money a lot of money right right so at

784
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:01,940
money a lot of money right right so at
 

785
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,490
money a lot of money right right so at
least with encryption you can have

786
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:03,500
least with encryption you can have
 

787
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,430
least with encryption you can have
multiple copies of your file backed up

788
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:06,440
multiple copies of your file backed up
 

789
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,740
multiple copies of your file backed up
that has your keys

790
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:08,750
that has your keys
 

791
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,220
that has your keys
but don't just print B for him when he

792
