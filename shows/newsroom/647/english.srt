320
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:31,750
and that's what I want to focus on today
 

321
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,390
and that's what I want to focus on today
I want to focus on on a positive note

322
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,400
I want to focus on on a positive note
 

323
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,230
I want to focus on on a positive note
and so who's currently hiring blockchain

324
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
and so who's currently hiring blockchain
 

325
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,990
and so who's currently hiring blockchain
developers or blockchain people that

326
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,000
developers or blockchain people that
 

327
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,880
developers or blockchain people that
that our knowledge of blockchain

would like to focus more on development
 

369
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,510
would like to focus more on development
so if you don't know anything about

370
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
so if you don't know anything about
 

371
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,820
so if you don't know anything about
programming don't worry about it this

372
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:41,830
programming don't worry about it this
 

373
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,990
programming don't worry about it this
this is your moment here and so what

374
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
this is your moment here and so what
 

375
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,170
this is your moment here and so what
you'll see behind me is a step by step

376
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,180
you'll see behind me is a step by step
 

377
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,930
you'll see behind me is a step by step
idea on how you can get into this market

378
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:51,940
idea on how you can get into this market
 

379
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,399
idea on how you can get into this market
how you can find

380
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:53,409
how you can find
 

381
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,409
how you can find
the job in this industry and so the

382
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:55,419
the job in this industry and so the
 

383
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:56,969
the job in this industry and so the
first step if you don't know anything

384
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:56,979
first step if you don't know anything
 

385
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,769
first step if you don't know anything
about a programming language is learn a

386
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:58,779
about a programming language is learn a
 

387
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,959
about a programming language is learn a
programming language now it's not

388
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:00,969
programming language now it's not
 

389
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:03,540
programming language now it's not
difficult within a day you know the

390
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:03,550
difficult within a day you know the
 

391
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,459
difficult within a day you know the
basics it's really easy to do that it's

392
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:05,469
basics it's really easy to do that it's
 

393
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,499
basics it's really easy to do that it's
all about logic if you can't think in a

394
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:07,509
all about logic if you can't think in a
 

395
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:10,409
all about logic if you can't think in a
logical way then learning a programming

396
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:10,419
logical way then learning a programming
 

397
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,449
logical way then learning a programming
language is something very easy and I

398
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:12,459
language is something very easy and I
 

399
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,399
language is something very easy and I
would start with JavaScript and they're

400
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:14,409
would start with JavaScript and they're
 

401
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,019
would start with JavaScript and they're
all by the way very similar so there's

402
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:16,029
all by the way very similar so there's
 

403
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,269
all by the way very similar so there's
no big differences between one language

404
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:18,279
no big differences between one language
 

405
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,889
no big differences between one language
and the other I would start with

406
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:19,899
and the other I would start with
 

407
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,350
and the other I would start with
JavaScript because you can develop

408
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:22,360
JavaScript because you can develop
 

409
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,339
JavaScript because you can develop
something that is easily visible on a

410
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:26,349
something that is easily visible on a
 

411
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,779
something that is easily visible on a
screen or so and then if you know

412
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:30,789
screen or so and then if you know
 

413
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,329
screen or so and then if you know
JavaScript I would go over into Python

414
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:33,339
JavaScript I would go over into Python
 

415
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,089
JavaScript I would go over into Python
because that's what a lot of crypto

416
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:36,099
because that's what a lot of crypto
 

417
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,019
because that's what a lot of crypto
companies or platforms are using there

then of course you have to dive deep

470
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:45,100
then of course you have to dive deep
 

471
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,150
then of course you have to dive deep
into a theorem programming so solidity

472
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
into a theorem programming so solidity
 

473
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,809
into a theorem programming so solidity
and so on in future it will be VIPRE and
