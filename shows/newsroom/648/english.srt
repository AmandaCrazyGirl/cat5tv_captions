643
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,100
why is what it was in Oracle is tool
that tells you a specific value at a

644
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,110
that tells you a specific value at a
 

645
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,760
that tells you a specific value at a
specific time for example the price of

646
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:33,770
specific time for example the price of
 

647
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,060
specific time for example the price of
Bitcoin as you know there are probably

648
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,070
Bitcoin as you know there are probably
 

649
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,480
Bitcoin as you know there are probably
over four hundred five hundred exchanges

650
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,490
over four hundred five hundred exchanges
 

651
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,329
over four hundred five hundred exchanges
that are trading in in Bitcoin and they

652
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:43,339
that are trading in in Bitcoin and they
 

653
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,100
that are trading in in Bitcoin and they
all have a different price I mean it's a

654
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,110
all have a different price I mean it's a
 

655
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,810
all have a different price I mean it's a
minimal difference but what happens if

656
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:46,820
minimal difference but what happens if
 

657
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,730
minimal difference but what happens if
there's a crash and the difference

658
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:48,740
there's a crash and the difference
 

659
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,170
there's a crash and the difference
between those exchanges will be

660
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:50,180
between those exchanges will be
 

661
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,140
between those exchanges will be
substantial and that is of importance

662
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,150
substantial and that is of importance
 

663
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,170
substantial and that is of importance
for for example these defy platforms

664
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,180
for for example these defy platforms

which price should they use if they have
 

667
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,530
which price should they use if they have
to liquidate a position and for that

668
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:02,540
to liquidate a position and for that

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:30,770
that and the base layer and they chew
 

683
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,500
that and the base layer and they chew
moving that now to layer to layer to

684
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,510
moving that now to layer to layer to
 

685
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,449
moving that now to layer to layer to
fund a solution so it's like the

686
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:37,459
fund a solution so it's like the
 

687
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,880

part of the base cryptocurrency it's a

690
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
part of the base cryptocurrency it's a
 

691
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,910
part of the base cryptocurrency it's a
level higher so that is a decision that

692
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:48,920
level higher so that is a decision that
 

693
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
level higher so that is a decision that
they took let's see if that comes

694
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,930
they took let's see if that comes
 

695
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,240
they took let's see if that comes
because it's not the first time that

696
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,250
because it's not the first time that
 

697
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,410
because it's not the first time that
they changed that and yeah that's that's

698
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:56,420
they changed that and yeah that's that's
 

699
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,100
they changed that and yeah that's that's
it for me so I wish you a great week
