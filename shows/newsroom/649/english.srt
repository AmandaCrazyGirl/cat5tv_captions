by around fifty percent currently that
is twelve and a half percent every ten

235
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,490
clock in the upper time is based on the
current block time so it takes around

236
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:51,500
current block time so it takes around
 

237
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,860
current block time so it takes around
eight point eight minutes not 10 minutes

around 10 minutes or currently every

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
around 10 minutes or currently every
 

251
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,460
around 10 minutes or currently every
eight and a half minutes so you have to

252
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,470
eight and a half minutes so you have to
 

253
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,830
eight and a half minutes so you have to
watch the upper time because that is the

254
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
watch the upper time because that is the
 

255
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,370
watch the upper time because that is the
one that counts there is no time within

256
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:15,380
one that counts there is no time within
 

257
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,650
one that counts there is no time within
the Bitcoin blockchain it's just block

258
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:17,660
the Bitcoin blockchain it's just block
 

259
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,950
the Bitcoin blockchain it's just block
and every look I said it takes around 10

260
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
and every look I said it takes around 10
 

261
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,520
and every look I said it takes around 10
minutes to be mined and so there's this

262
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:24,530
minutes to be mined and so there's this
 

263
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,230
minutes to be mined and so there's this
time difference coming from now how do

work with ASIC machines so only the best
 

325
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,050
work with ASIC machines so only the best
machines will continue working on the

2013 when somebody came up with the ASIC

332
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
2013 when somebody came up with the ASIC
 

333
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,680
2013 when somebody came up with the ASIC
for the first time all those GPS miners

334
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:08,690
for the first time all those GPS miners
 

335
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,260
for the first time all those GPS miners
GPU - sorry the GPO - were obsolete and

336
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,270
GPU - sorry the GPO - were obsolete and
 

337
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,420
GPU - sorry the GPO - were obsolete and
could be switched off because none of

338
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,430
could be switched off because none of
 

339
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,220
could be switched off because none of
them were really mining any bitcoins

340
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,230
them were really mining any bitcoins
 

341
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,480
them were really mining any bitcoins
anymore

342
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,490
anymore
 

343
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,830

so life will continue and also if let's

344
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
so life will continue and also if let's
 

345
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,200
so life will continue and also if let's
say a substantial amount of Bitcoin or

346
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,210
say a substantial amount of Bitcoin or
 

347
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,350
say a substantial amount of Bitcoin or
switch of the machines then as it's

348
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
switch of the machines then as it's
 

349
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
switch of the machines then as it's
currently happening with the time the

350
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,370
currently happening with the time the
 

351
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,980
currently happening with the time the
time will be inverted so it will take

352
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:30,990
time will be inverted so it will take
 

353
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,780
time will be inverted so it will take
longer than 10 minutes to mine a Bitcoin

354
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:32,790
longer than 10 minutes to mine a Bitcoin
 

355
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:39,670
longer than 10 minutes to mine a Bitcoin
and to mine a block and and after 2016

356
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
and to mine a block and and after 2016
 

357
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,980
and to mine a block and and after 2016
blocks the difficulty will be just it

358
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:42,990
blocks the difficulty will be just it
 

359
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,870
blocks the difficulty will be just it
anyway and it will be back to the user

360
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
anyway and it will be back to the user
 

361
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
anyway and it will be back to the user
of 10 minutes so there's nothing to

362
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,290
of 10 minutes so there's nothing to
 

363
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,150
of 10 minutes so there's nothing to
worry about this is a natural effect

364
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
worry about this is a natural effect
 

365
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,430
worry about this is a natural effect
that happens on the blockchain on the

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:52,440
that happens on the blockchain on the
 

367
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,250
that happens on the blockchain on the
Bitcoin blockchain and it's not the

00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:55,260
Bitcoin blockchain and it's not the
 

369
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,690
Bitcoin blockchain and it's not the
first time it's the third time that this

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,040
really interesting one it's called D SEP
 

389
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,470
really interesting one it's called D SEP
and it's translated into digital

390
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:18,480
and it's translated into digital
 

391
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,350
and it's translated into digital
currency electronic payment and that is

392

currency electronic payment and that is
 

393
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,680

403
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,850
they have done it now they're rolling it
out and it would have I'm pretty sure

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,050
blockchain money and as you probably
know from China if you go to a small

rolling it out and testing it they will
 

445
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,990
rolling it out and testing it they will
be involving huge vendors like
