we see suddenly compound increasing by

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:36,510
we see suddenly compound increasing by
 

387
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,659
we see suddenly compound increasing by
two hundred ninety two percent the over

twenty coins that had an increase of
over fifteen percent and on the downside

over fifteen percent and on the downside
 

393
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,370

only two coins lost more than fifteen
 

395
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,010

percent so what happened here why is

396
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,020
percent so what happened here why is
 

397
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,190
percent so what happened here why is
there suddenly such a big change and if

398
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,200
there suddenly such a big change and if

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,260
we look into the defy market cap because
compound is part of the defy market we

402
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,270
compound is part of the defy market we
 

403
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,120
compound is part of the defy market we
see that most of those changes are

404
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,130
see that most of those changes are
 

405
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,660
see that most of those changes are
coming from compound so last week I

406
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:02,670
coming from compound so last week I
 

407
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,570
coming from compound so last week I
showed you this this chart and it was a

408
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:05,580
showed you this this chart and it was a
 

409
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,420
showed you this this chart and it was a
2.3 billion now it's 6.7 billion as you

410
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,430
2.3 billion now it's 6.7 billion as you
 

411
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,760
2.3 billion now it's 6.7 billion as you
can see most of that is coming from

412
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:10,770
can see most of that is coming from
 

413
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,370
can see most of that is coming from
compound now let's dive a little bit

414
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:13,380
compound now let's dive a little bit
 

415
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,930
compound now let's dive a little bit
deeper into this you can check what

416
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:14,940
deeper into this you can check what
 

417
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,690
deeper into this you can check what
happened and if we take a look at the

418
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:17,700
happened and if we take a look at the
 

419
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,450
happened and if we take a look at the
compound plot platform so compound dot

420
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:20,460
compound plot platform so compound dot
 

421
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,820
compound plot platform so compound dot
financed we see it's basically like a

422
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:22,830
financed we see it's basically like a
 

423
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,630
financed we see it's basically like a
bank so you can supply money to the

424
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
bank so you can supply money to the
 

425
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,610
bank so you can supply money to the
environment or you can borrow money and

426
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:28,620
environment or you can borrow money and
 

427
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,430
environment or you can borrow money and
in the case of let's say Bay 80 basic

428
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
in the case of let's say Bay 80 basic
 

429
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,370
in the case of let's say Bay 80 basic
attention token you will receive 27

430
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:34,380
attention token you will receive 27
 

431
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,500
attention token you will receive 27
percent and if you borrow money you have

432
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,510
percent and if you borrow money you have
 

433
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,410
percent and if you borrow money you have
to pay 34 percent so far everything is

434
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
to pay 34 percent so far everything is
 

435
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,580
to pay 34 percent so far everything is
fine now last week compound was listed

436
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:43,590
fine now last week compound was listed
 

437
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,920
fine now last week compound was listed
on coin base and that caused a huge

438
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:45,930
on coin base and that caused a huge
 

439
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,230
on coin base and that caused a huge
increase in price and because of that

440
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
increase in price and because of that
 

441
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
increase in price and because of that
this environment went absolutely crazy

442
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,250
this environment went absolutely crazy
 

443
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,820
this environment went absolutely crazy
and the reason is that every time you

444
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:52,830
and the reason is that every time you
 

445
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,040
and the reason is that every time you
take out a loan or receive money you

446
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,050
take out a loan or receive money you
 

447
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,380
take out a loan or receive money you
will be compensated with comps which is

448
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,390
will be compensated with comps which is
 

449
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,290
will be compensated with comps which is
the native token of this platform so you

450
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,300
the native token of this platform so you
 

451
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,990
the native token of this platform so you
receive money in other words if you take

452
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,000
receive money in other words if you take
 

453
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,220
receive money in other words if you take
out a loan and to check that there's

454
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,230
out a loan and to check that there's
 

455
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,200
out a loan and to check that there's
another website called the predictions

dot exchange and if I say I want to have
 

459
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,720
dot exchange and if I say I want to have
1000 here so enter 1000

460
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:16,730
1000 here so enter 1000
 

461
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,210
1000 here so enter 1000
basic attention token and I do calculate

462
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:19,220
basic attention token and I do calculate
 

463
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,480
basic attention token and I do calculate
then I see that I will receive on top of

464
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,490
then I see that I will receive on top of
 

465
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,030
then I see that I will receive on top of
those thousand dollars I will received

466
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
those thousand dollars I will received
 

467
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
those thousand dollars I will received
seventeen percent interest so I don't

468
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,010
seventeen percent interest so I don't
 

469
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,740
seventeen percent interest so I don't
have to pay interest I will receive

470
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:29,750
have to pay interest I will receive
 

471
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,360
have to pay interest I will receive
seventeen percent interest

472
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,370
seventeen percent interest
 

473
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,690
seventeen percent interest
now some people are clever and they take

474
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:34,700
now some people are clever and they take
 

475
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,790
now some people are clever and they take
that money and put it back into the

476
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
that money and put it back into the
 

477
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,790
that money and put it back into the
system and that's called yield farming

478
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:39,800
system and that's called yield farming
 

479
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,040
system and that's called yield farming
and with yield farming you can achieve

480
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,050
and with yield farming you can achieve
 

481
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,280
and with yield farming you can achieve
interests of over 100 percent now I have

482
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,290
interests of over 100 percent now I have
 

483
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,870
interests of over 100 percent now I have
to clearly say at this stage so it's a

484
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:49,880
to clearly say at this stage so it's a
 

485
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,300
