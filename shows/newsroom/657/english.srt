more than 15
 

501
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,710
more than 15
this time it's a mere six coins and

502
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
this time it's a mere six coins and
 

503
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,269
this time it's a mere six coins and
uh on the downside last week we had two

504
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
uh on the downside last week we had two
 

505
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,590
uh on the downside last week we had two
coins that lost more than 15 percent

506
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
coins that lost more than 15 percent
 

507
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,350
coins that lost more than 15 percent
this time it's a few more than that so

508
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
this time it's a few more than that so
 

509
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,870
this time it's a few more than that so
it's slightly bearish behavior in the

510
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
it's slightly bearish behavior in the
 

511
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,750
it's slightly bearish behavior in the
market

512
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
market
 

513
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,030
market
and if we look into the d5 market then

514
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
and if we look into the d5 market then
 

515
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,509
and if we look into the d5 market then
similar picture there from 6.7 billion

516
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
similar picture there from 6.7 billion
 

517
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,670
similar picture there from 6.7 billion
down to 6.1 billion

518
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
down to 6.1 billion
 

519
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,910
down to 6.1 billion
dropped between last week and this week

520
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
dropped between last week and this week
 

521
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,710
dropped between last week and this week
now

522
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
now
 

523
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,470
now
if you remember last week we went into

524
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
if you remember last week we went into
 

525
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,030
if you remember last week we went into
detail in regards to the d5 market how

526
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
detail in regards to the d5 market how
 

527
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,550
detail in regards to the d5 market how
to participate

528
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
to participate
 

529
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,350
to participate
in this market and how the future looks

530
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
in this market and how the future looks
 

531
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,070
in this market and how the future looks
like

532
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
like
 

533
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,750
like
but also that there are risks attached

534
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
but also that there are risks attached
 

535
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,910
but also that there are risks attached
to that because it's a very young market

536
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
to that because it's a very young market
 

537
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,670
to that because it's a very young market
and so this is what happened between

538
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
and so this is what happened between
 

539
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,310
and so this is what happened between
last week and this week

540
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
last week and this week
 

541
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,430
last week and this week
a hacker stole around half a million u.s

542
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
a hacker stole around half a million u.s
 

543
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,949
a hacker stole around half a million u.s
dollars now it's not stealing in

544
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
dollars now it's not stealing in
 

545
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,670
dollars now it's not stealing in
traditional sense we just take something

546
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
traditional sense we just take something
 

547
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,790
traditional sense we just take something
it's just that they

548
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
it's just that they
 

549
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,350
it's just that they
made use of these different protocols in

550
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
made use of these different protocols in
 

551
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,310
made use of these different protocols in
a way

552
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
a way
 

553
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,509
a way
that they were able to harvest

554
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
that they were able to harvest
 

555
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,829
that they were able to harvest
around half a million us dollars and the

556
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
around half a million us dollars and the
 

557
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,110
around half a million us dollars and the
way that worked

558
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
way that worked
 

559
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,110
way that worked
is as you remember this is one of those

560
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
is as you remember this is one of those
 

561
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,190
is as you remember this is one of those
platforms where you can participate

562
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
platforms where you can participate
 

563
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,509
platforms where you can participate
and so you they use the balance and pool

564
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
and so you they use the balance and pool
 

565
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,350
and so you they use the balance and pool
the balancer platform in one of those

566
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
the balancer platform in one of those
 

567
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,470
the balancer platform in one of those
pools

568
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
pools
 

569
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,269
pools
and they use the flashlight technology

570
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
and they use the flashlight technology
 

571
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,949
and they use the flashlight technology
so with this technology which means a

572
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
so with this technology which means a
 

573
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,550
so with this technology which means a
flashlight is something that happens

574
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
flashlight is something that happens
 

575
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,910
flashlight is something that happens
between two blocks so it's never

576
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
between two blocks so it's never
 

577
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,870
between two blocks so it's never
registered

578
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
registered
 

579
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,350
registered
so you can take a loan as high as you

580
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
so you can take a loan as high as you
 

581
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,150
so you can take a loan as high as you
want

582
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
want
 

583
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,430
want
doesn't matter because it's never

584
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
doesn't matter because it's never
 

585
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,509
doesn't matter because it's never
registered but between two

586
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
registered but between two
 

587
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,350
registered but between two
those two blocks you can do whatever you

588
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
those two blocks you can do whatever you
 

589
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,630
those two blocks you can do whatever you
want to do uh

590
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
want to do uh
 

591
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,470
want to do uh
you can do whatever you want to with

592
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
you can do whatever you want to with
 

593
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,310
you can do whatever you want to with
that money and that's what they did

594
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
that money and that's what they did
 

595
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,030
that money and that's what they did
so they took out that loan and then they

596
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
so they took out that loan and then they
 

597
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,470
so they took out that loan and then they
started swapping between

598
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
started swapping between
 

599
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,269
started swapping between
the ethereum and the sta token and they

600
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
the ethereum and the sta token and they
 

601
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,550
the ethereum and the sta token and they
did that 24 times

602
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
did that 24 times
 

603
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,509
did that 24 times
until the whole pool was drained again

604
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
until the whole pool was drained again
 

605
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,269
until the whole pool was drained again
that's between two blocks so

606
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
that's between two blocks so
 

607
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,110
that's between two blocks so
it's never registered but they were

608
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
it's never registered but they were
 

609
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,870
it's never registered but they were
making use of that

610
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
making use of that
 

611
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,509
making use of that
and every time that this transfer

612
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
and every time that this transfer
 

613
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,230
and every time that this transfer
happened

614
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
happened
 

615
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,990
happened
a transfer fee of one percent was

616
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
a transfer fee of one percent was
 

617
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,750
a transfer fee of one percent was
charged to the recipient

618
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
charged to the recipient
 

619
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,430
charged to the recipient
but that was not registered on the

620
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
but that was not registered on the
 

621
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,790
but that was not registered on the
balance of platform

622
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
balance of platform
 

623
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,870
balance of platform
and so every time the attacker swapped

624
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
and so every time the attacker swapped
 

625
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,829
and so every time the attacker swapped
between those two

626
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
between those two
 

627
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,870
between those two
coins uh those two tokens the balancer

628
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
coins uh those two tokens the balancer
 

629
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,710
coins uh those two tokens the balancer
pool received one percent less

630
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
pool received one percent less
 

631
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,230
pool received one percent less
sta than was expected and these people

632
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
sta than was expected and these people
 

633
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,829
sta than was expected and these people
were harvesting that

634
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
were harvesting that
 

635
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,310
were harvesting that
so it shows how young this industry is

636
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
so it shows how young this industry is
 

637
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,230
so it shows how young this industry is
but also how interesting it is

638
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
but also how interesting it is
 

639
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,750
but also how interesting it is
and as i encourage you last week just

640
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
and as i encourage you last week just
 

641
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,150
and as i encourage you last week just
go in there and learn more about it now

642
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
go in there and learn more about it now
 

643
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,590
go in there and learn more about it now
on the other side

644
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
on the other side
 

645
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,750
on the other side
looking at the traditional market

646
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
looking at the traditional market
 

647
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,430
looking at the traditional market
something similar happened

648
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
something similar happened
 

649
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,630
something similar happened
uh 2.8 billion u.s dollars were scammed

650
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
uh 2.8 billion u.s dollars were scammed
 

651
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,910
uh 2.8 billion u.s dollars were scammed
in the gold market

652
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
in the gold market
 

653
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,190
in the gold market
now that's something that would never

654
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
now that's something that would never
 

655
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,990
now that's something that would never
have be able to happen in the bitcoin or

656
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
have be able to happen in the bitcoin or
 

657
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,710
have be able to happen in the bitcoin or
the crypto

658
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
the crypto
 

659
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,269
the crypto
market especially bitcoin because it's

660
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
market especially bitcoin because it's
 

661
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,350
market especially bitcoin because it's
the most secure platform in the world

662
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
the most secure platform in the world
 

663
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,310
the most secure platform in the world
uh but in gold everybody operates with

664
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
uh but in gold everybody operates with
 

665
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,630
