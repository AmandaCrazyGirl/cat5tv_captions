506
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
didn't touch on jeff was performance
 

507
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,350
didn't touch on jeff was performance
yeah and i do think about how even on

508
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
yeah and i do think about how even on
 

509
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,670
yeah and i do think about how even on
our desktop computer at home

510
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
our desktop computer at home
 

511
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,350

my youngest will have that same scenario

512
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
my youngest will have that same scenario
 

513
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,269
my youngest will have that same scenario
20 tabs open and then he'll switch user

514
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
20 tabs open and then he'll switch user
 

515
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,870
20 tabs open and then he'll switch user
oh right so which is great

516
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
oh right so which is great
 

517
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,350
oh right so which is great
because linux mint allows us to have

518
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
because linux mint allows us to have
 

519
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,030
because linux mint allows us to have
multiple people logged in at once but

520
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
multiple people logged in at once but
 

521
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,230
multiple people logged in at once but
now we've got

522
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
now we've got
 

523
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,710
now we've got
somebody else logging in and double the

524
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
somebody else logging in and double the
 

525
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,590
somebody else logging in and double the
tabs yeah

526
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
tabs yeah
 

527
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,230
tabs yeah
so his java javascript timers are still

528
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
so his java javascript timers are still
 

529
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,030
so his java javascript timers are still
going off

530
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
going off
 

531

in his browser on his profile yes
 

533
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,070
in his browser on his profile yes
so i wonder how it would affect

534
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
so i wonder how it would affect
 

535
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,269
so i wonder how it would affect
performance as well

536
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
performance as well
 

537
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,590
performance as well
yeah i i'm very interested to see i mean

538
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
yeah i i'm very interested to see i mean
 

539
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,150
yeah i i'm very interested to see i mean
i i know it's a small change

540
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
i i know it's a small change
 

541
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,430
i i know it's a small change
going from one second to the one minute

542
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
going from one second to the one minute
 

543
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,750

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
the impact because
 

547
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,630
the impact because
i i do think it's going to be

548

i i do think it's going to be
 

549
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,790
i i do think it's going to be

fantastic programmers world best
programmers

688
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
programmers
 

689
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,509
programmers
that are coding on the ethereum

690
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
that are coding on the ethereum
 

691
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,269
that are coding on the ethereum
blockchain and coming up with new ideas

692
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
blockchain and coming up with new ideas
 

693
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,470
blockchain and coming up with new ideas
of what to do

694
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
of what to do
 

695
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,190
of what to do
like the default market uh just as a

696
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
like the default market uh just as a
 

697
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,670
like the default market uh just as a
late

698
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
late
 

699
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,310
late
development and in cardano they're

700
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
development and in cardano they're
 

701
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,350
development and in cardano they're
coming from another

702
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
coming from another
 

703
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,710
coming from another
angle they're coming from the

704
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
angle they're coming from the
 

705
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,949
angle they're coming from the
intellectual angle from the theory

706
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
intellectual angle from the theory
 

707
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,790
intellectual angle from the theory
the theoretical angle and that's why

708
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
the theoretical angle and that's why
 

709
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,430
the theoretical angle and that's why
also took them much longer to go live

710
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
also took them much longer to go live
 

711
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,230
also took them much longer to go live
uh rather than um like a theorem they

712
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
uh rather than um like a theorem they
 

713
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,310
uh rather than um like a theorem they
went live very quickly in that sense

714
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
went live very quickly in that sense
 

715
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,310
went live very quickly in that sense
so it's interesting to see which one of

716
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
so it's interesting to see which one of
 

717
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,069
so it's interesting to see which one of
those two blockchains will

718
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
those two blockchains will
 

719
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,190
those two blockchains will
have the upper hand long term

720
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
have the upper hand long term
 

721
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,590
have the upper hand long term
now going into detail of what has

722
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
now going into detail of what has
 

723
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,710
now going into detail of what has
happened

724
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
happened
 

725
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,389
happened
i want to show you some presentations

726
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
i want to show you some presentations
 

727
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,750
i want to show you some presentations
that i really like

728
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
that i really like
 

729
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,990
that i really like
this one here is called beef chain which

730
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
this one here is called beef chain which
 

731
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,350
this one here is called beef chain which
is a supply management

732
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
is a supply management
 

733
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,790
is a supply management
supply chain management protocol

734
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
supply chain management protocol
 

735
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,470
supply chain management protocol
together with a legislator from wyoming

736
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
together with a legislator from wyoming
 

737
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,230
together with a legislator from wyoming
and it highlights the difficulties that

738
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
and it highlights the difficulties that
 

739
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,230
and it highlights the difficulties that
exist in this market

740
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
exist in this market
 

741
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,470
exist in this market
like here if a salmonella breaks out in

742
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
like here if a salmonella breaks out in
 

743
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,069
like here if a salmonella breaks out in
one of those factories

744
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
one of those factories
 

745
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,470
one of those factories
the recall can be really devastating

746
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
the recall can be really devastating
 

747
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,150
the recall can be really devastating
yeah like here peanut corporation of

748
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
yeah like here peanut corporation of
 

749
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,030
yeah like here peanut corporation of
america

750
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
america
 

751
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,710
america
that company doesn't exist anymore

752
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
that company doesn't exist anymore
 

753
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,790
that company doesn't exist anymore
because of the salmonella outbreak

754
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
because of the salmonella outbreak
 

755
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,150
because of the salmonella outbreak
and executives were handed 28 uh

756
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
and executives were handed 28 uh
 

757
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,629
and executives were handed 28 uh
years of prison and so it's important to

758
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
years of prison and so it's important to
 

759
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,430
years of prison and so it's important to
really have

760
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
really have
 

761
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,470
really have
an end-to-end uh tool

762
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
an end-to-end uh tool
 

763
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,389
an end-to-end uh tool
that you can rely on and that's what

764
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
that you can rely on and that's what
 

765
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,430
that you can rely on and that's what
they developed on the cardano blockchain

766
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
they developed on the cardano blockchain
 

767
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,269
they developed on the cardano blockchain
and i hope they one day they will also

768
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
and i hope they one day they will also
 

769
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,430
and i hope they one day they will also
do that on the medical side

770
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
do that on the medical side
 

771
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,550
do that on the medical side
because i i heard that uh 10

772
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
because i i heard that uh 10
 

773
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,829
because i i heard that uh 10
of all medication that you can buy is

774
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
of all medication that you can buy is
 

775
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,389
of all medication that you can buy is
fake or substandard and so such a tool

776
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
fake or substandard and so such a tool
 

777
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,230
fake or substandard and so such a tool
would be fantastic also in the medical

778
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
would be fantastic also in the medical
 

779
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,069
would be fantastic also in the medical
sector

780
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
sector
 

781
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,509
sector
next is onboarding so

782
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
next is onboarding so
 

783
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,829
next is onboarding so
um i mean in the western world we don't

784
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
um i mean in the western world we don't
 

785
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,870
um i mean in the western world we don't
have huge

786
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
have huge
 

787
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,870
have huge
problems in getting access to banks or

788
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
problems in getting access to banks or
 

789
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,949
problems in getting access to banks or
loans in other countries like here this

790
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
loans in other countries like here this
 

791
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,550
loans in other countries like here this
is africa for example it looks

792
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
is africa for example it looks
 

793
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,829
is africa for example it looks
completely different

794
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
completely different
 

795
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,430
completely different
but how do you do that you need to make

796
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
but how do you do that you need to make
 

797
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,910
but how do you do that you need to make
it in a way that it is secure

798
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
it in a way that it is secure
 

799
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,829
it in a way that it is secure
and that's exactly what they developed

800
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
and that's exactly what they developed
 

801
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,949
and that's exactly what they developed
here with a project called atala prism

802
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
here with a project called atala prism
 

803
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,550
here with a project called atala prism
and it's a big deal because it simply

804
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
and it's a big deal because it simply
 

805
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,030
and it's a big deal because it simply
will open up opportunities

806
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
will open up opportunities
 

807
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,829
will open up opportunities
like lending payments insurance banking

808
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
like lending payments insurance banking
 

809
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,069
like lending payments insurance banking
uh so in total they calculate over 400

810
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
uh so in total they calculate over 400
 

811
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,470
uh so in total they calculate over 400
billion globally

812
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
billion globally
 

813
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,870
billion globally
in d5 payments and in africa that could

814
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
in d5 payments and in africa that could
 

815
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,750
in d5 payments and in africa that could
benefit for

816
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
benefit for
 

817
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,150
benefit for
from such a tool it's just to make sure

818
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
from such a tool it's just to make sure
 

819
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,030
from such a tool it's just to make sure
that

820
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
that
 

821
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,430
that
you're in a secure way are able to

822
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
you're in a secure way are able to
 

823
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,629
you're in a secure way are able to
access

824
