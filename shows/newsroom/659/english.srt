with these things don't participate

382
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:18,910
with these things don't participate
 

383
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,540
with these things don't participate
there the moment you hear about some

384
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:21,550
there the moment you hear about some
 

385
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,970
there the moment you hear about some
pump it will still be too late again

386
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:23,980
pump it will still be too late again
 

387
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,430
pump it will still be too late again
because those that started that pump are

388
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:26,440
because those that started that pump are
 

389
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,040
because those that started that pump are
already planning on how to leave that

390
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,050
already planning on how to leave that
 

391
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,649
already planning on how to leave that
one next is if we look into compound and

392
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:34,659
one next is if we look into compound and
 

393
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,279
one next is if we look into compound and
if we want to borrow ransom money then

394
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:38,289
if we want to borrow ransom money then
 

395
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,170
if we want to borrow ransom money then
there is some collateral factor in here

396
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:40,180
there is some collateral factor in here
 

397
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,719
there is some collateral factor in here
yeah so sixty percent in other words if

398
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:42,729
yeah so sixty percent in other words if
 

399
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,410
yeah so sixty percent in other words if
I put in 100 percent then I can take

400
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:46,420
I put in 100 percent then I can take
 

401
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,990
I put in 100 percent then I can take
sixty percent out so there's over an

402
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,000
sixty percent out so there's over an
 

403
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,480
sixty percent out so there's over an
over collateralization in in this

404
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,490
over collateralization in in this
 

405
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,930
over collateralization in in this
industry and that's how most of these

406
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:53,940
industry and that's how most of these
 

407
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,110
industry and that's how most of these
are staying on a fairly low risk basis

408
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,120
are staying on a fairly low risk basis
 

409
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,330
are staying on a fairly low risk basis
but there has been a new development

410
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:00,340
but there has been a new development
 

411
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,610
but there has been a new development
obvious the first one that is starting

412
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:02,620
obvious the first one that is starting
 

413
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,300
obvious the first one that is starting
now with credit ik credit allocation so

414
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,310
now with credit ik credit allocation so
 

415
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,280
now with credit ik credit allocation so
in other words you can have a credit

416
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,290
in other words you can have a credit
 

417
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,050
in other words you can have a credit
without even putting up some collateral

418
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,060
without even putting up some collateral
 

419
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,720
without even putting up some collateral
and the way they solve that is that you

420
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:12,730
and the way they solve that is that you
 

421
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,240
and the way they solve that is that you
have to sign a contract with a person

422
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,250
have to sign a contract with a person
 

423
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,730
have to sign a contract with a person
that gives you all whom you give the

424
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:17,740
that gives you all whom you give the
 

425
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,700
that gives you all whom you give the
money and it will be sorted out in an

426
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:20,710
money and it will be sorted out in an
 

427
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,490
money and it will be sorted out in an
illegal or regular court in case there

428
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:23,500
illegal or regular court in case there
 

429
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,290
illegal or regular court in case there
is a default so that's an interesting

430
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,300
is a default so that's an interesting
 

431
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,410
is a default so that's an interesting
development I find now another

432
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:28,420
development I find now another
 

433
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,000
development I find now another
interesting development but more on the

434
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,010
interesting development but more on the
 

435
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,250
interesting development but more on the
negative side or not negative but one

436
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:32,260
negative side or not negative but one
 

437
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,770
negative side or not negative but one
has to be careful is tether as you

438
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:34,780
has to be careful is tether as you
 

439
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:40,020
has to be careful is tether as you
remember tether has got from the 24-hour

440
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,030
remember tether has got from the 24-hour
 

441
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,180
remember tether has got from the 24-hour
volume it's number two or usually number

442
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,190
volume it's number two or usually number
 

443
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,350
volume it's number two or usually number
one so you see it's very close to

444
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
one so you see it's very close to
 

445
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,870
one so you see it's very close to
Bitcoin with nineteen billion being
