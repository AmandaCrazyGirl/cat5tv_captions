25th on
 

831
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,829
25th on
2019 so nine months ago it increased

832
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
2019 so nine months ago it increased
 

833
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,670

seven
 

835
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,829
seven
639 percent from that day so that's

836
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
639 percent from that day so that's
 

837
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,350
639 percent from that day so that's
interesting statistics so probably i

838
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
interesting statistics so probably i
 

839
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,949
interesting statistics so probably i

so this is how you read the my plus two

904
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
so this is how you read the my plus two
 

905
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,110
so this is how you read the my plus two
percent and the minus two percent it's a

906
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
percent and the minus two percent it's a
 

907
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,509
percent and the minus two percent it's a
it's an interesting number if you want

908
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
it's an interesting number if you want
 

909
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,350
it's an interesting number if you want
to invest in coins because some of those

910
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360

to invest in coins because some of those
coins

912
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240

it's very difficult to sell also
 

923
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,550
it's very difficult to sell also
something

924
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560

to bed and
 

1841
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,750
to bed and
because it's internet connected they can

1842
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
because it's internet connected they can
 

1843
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,990
because it's internet connected they can
make it they can set off all the phones

1844
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
make it they can set off all the phones
 

1845
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,190
make it they can set off all the phones
vibrating like this

1846
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
vibrating like this
 

1847
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,509
vibrating like this
in any area of the world where they have

1848
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:53,519
in any area of the world where they have
 

1849

these devices
 

1851
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,870
these devices
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such

1852
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such
 

1853
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,430
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such
an easy hack so it's like

1854
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
an easy hack so it's like
 

1855
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,230
an easy hack so it's like
how can they trust that data well i

1856
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,240
how can they trust that data well i
 

1857
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,110
how can they trust that data well i
think it's brilliant

1858
