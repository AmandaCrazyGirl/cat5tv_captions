with a vulnerable domain controller in
some cases attackers may use a separate

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,309
some cases attackers may use a separate
vulnerability to gain a foothold inside

00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
vulnerability to gain a foothold inside
 

177
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,190
vulnerability to gain a foothold inside
a network

178
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
a network
 

179
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,509
a network
and then exploit zero logon to take over

180
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
and then exploit zero logon to take over
 

181
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,790
and then exploit zero logon to take over
the domain controller

182
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
the domain controller
 

183
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,750
the domain controller
i think a good example of a way for

184
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
i think a good example of a way for
 

185
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,869
i think a good example of a way for
these types of

186
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
these types of
 

187
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,990
these types of
scripts to get into networks are

188
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
scripts to get into networks are
 

189
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,949
scripts to get into networks are
out of date computers on the network yep

190
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
out of date computers on the network yep
 

191
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,509
out of date computers on the network yep
and

192
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
and
 

193
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,390
and
also social engineering scams we hear a

194
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
also social engineering scams we hear a
 

195
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,270
also social engineering scams we hear a
lot about

196
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
lot about
 

197
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,190
lot about
like you probably receive these emails

198
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
like you probably receive these emails
 

199
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,190
like you probably receive these emails
that try to trick you into following

200
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
that try to trick you into following
 

201
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,949
that try to trick you into following
through with a process of

through with a process of
 

203
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,710
through with a process of
entering a credential or something like

entering a credential or something like
 

205
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,470
entering a credential or something like
that

206
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
that
 

207
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,750
that
the the risk that we run and the sad

208
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
the the risk that we run and the sad
 

209
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,869
the the risk that we run and the sad
case that i see as

210
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
case that i see as
 

211
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,390
case that i see as
in i t is that sometimes people think

212
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
in i t is that sometimes people think
 

213
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,030
in i t is that sometimes people think
well

214
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
well
 

215
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,630
well
i don't need to update that computer

216
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
i don't need to update that computer
 

217
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,470
i don't need to update that computer
because it's in the back room nobody

218
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
because it's in the back room nobody
 

219
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,910
because it's in the back room nobody
really uses it

220
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
really uses it
 

221
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,990
really uses it
or oh well we need this one to still

222
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
or oh well we need this one to still
 

223
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,589
or oh well we need this one to still
have windows xp because

224
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
have windows xp because
 

225
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,949
have windows xp because
we have problems with one of our

226
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
we have problems with one of our
 

227
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,630
we have problems with one of our
printers if we don't

228
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
printers if we don't
 

229
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,030
printers if we don't
uh we're still seeing a lot of windows 7

230
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
uh we're still seeing a lot of windows 7
 

231
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,990
uh we're still seeing a lot of windows 7
systems

232
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
systems
 

233
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,110
systems
and that is a tragedy if you have a

234
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
and that is a tragedy if you have a
 

235
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,110
and that is a tragedy if you have a
windows 7 or windows xp system on your

236
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
windows 7 or windows xp system on your
 

237
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,789
windows 7 or windows xp system on your
network just

238
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
network just
 

239
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,350
network just
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the

240
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the
 

241
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,429
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the
the thing is is with those systems so

242
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
the thing is is with those systems so
 

243
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,869
the thing is is with those systems so
microsoft has

244
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
microsoft has
 

245
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,550
microsoft has
what we call eol or end of life

246
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
what we call eol or end of life
 

247
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,629
what we call eol or end of life
has has ended the life of these

248
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
has has ended the life of these
 

249
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,390
has has ended the life of these
operating systems

250
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
operating systems
 

251
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,310
operating systems
so they've said you've got to upgrade to

252
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
so they've said you've got to upgrade to
 

253
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,990
so they've said you've got to upgrade to
windows 10. well i don't want to upgrade

254
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
windows 10. well i don't want to upgrade
 

255
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,830
windows 10. well i don't want to upgrade
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.

256
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
 

257
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,150
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
i understand that and i respect that

258
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
i understand that and i respect that
 

259
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,590
i understand that and i respect that
however

260
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
however
 

261
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,270
however
here's the problem hackers

262
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
here's the problem hackers
 

263
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,230
here's the problem hackers
now are able to exploit these operating

264
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
now are able to exploit these operating
 

265
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,749
now are able to exploit these operating
systems

266
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
systems
 

267
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,830
systems
and as they do that as they find

268
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
and as they do that as they find
 

269
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,030
and as they do that as they find
exploits there's a couple of things that

270
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
exploits there's a couple of things that
 

271
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,590
exploits there's a couple of things that
happen

272
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
happen
 

273
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,030
happen
one they either give away or sell those

274
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
one they either give away or sell those
 

275
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,629
one they either give away or sell those
exploits

276
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
exploits
 

277
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,670
exploits
or two they're just they're released

278
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
or two they're just they're released
 

279
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,030
or two they're just they're released
to the public through whether it's

280
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
to the public through whether it's
 

281
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,870
to the public through whether it's
through the dark web or even on github

282
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
through the dark web or even on github
 

283
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,909
through the dark web or even on github
yep as as security research

284
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
yep as as security research
 

285
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,029
yep as as security research
and so now these hackers

286
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
and so now these hackers
 

287
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,390
and so now these hackers
if you will we're going to call them

288
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
if you will we're going to call them
 

289
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,150
if you will we're going to call them
that but realistically

290
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
that but realistically
 

291
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,749
that but realistically
in a lot of cases they're what we call

292
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
in a lot of cases they're what we call
 

293
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,510
in a lot of cases they're what we call
script kitties

294
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
script kitties
 

295
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,870
script kitties
and these are

296
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880

 

297
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,909

not even like hackers yes but they don't

298
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
not even like hackers yes but they don't
 

299
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,749
not even like hackers yes but they don't
have to have a lot of knowledge because

300
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
have to have a lot of knowledge because
 

301
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,710
have to have a lot of knowledge because
the

302
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
the
 

303
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,909
the
the exploit is publicly that's right

304
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
the exploit is publicly that's right
 

305
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,790
the exploit is publicly that's right
known and understood so if there are

306
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
known and understood so if there are
 

307
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,629
known and understood so if there are
exploits that are available for an

308
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
exploits that are available for an
 

309
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,469
exploits that are available for an
operating system

310
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
operating system
 

311
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,790
operating system
what do we expect to happen we expect

312
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
what do we expect to happen we expect
 

313
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,029
what do we expect to happen we expect
the operating system vendor microsoft in

314
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
the operating system vendor microsoft in
 

315
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,990
the operating system vendor microsoft in
this case

316
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
this case
 

317
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,350
this case
to patch that exploit to fix it

318
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
to patch that exploit to fix it
 

319
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,990
to patch that exploit to fix it
and that's the case with windows 10.

320
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
and that's the case with windows 10.
 

321
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,710
and that's the case with windows 10.
sadly though

322
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
sadly though
 

323
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,110
sadly though
those that are eol it's not the case

324
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
those that are eol it's not the case
 

325
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,189
those that are eol it's not the case
with an eol operating system sometimes

326
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
with an eol operating system sometimes
 

327
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,310
with an eol operating system sometimes
we hear oh well i don't need support

328
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
we hear oh well i don't need support
 

329
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,150
we hear oh well i don't need support
well microsoft has ended support that's

330
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
well microsoft has ended support that's
 

331
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,990
well microsoft has ended support that's
what we've heard yeah they've ended

332
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
what we've heard yeah they've ended
 

333
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,590
what we've heard yeah they've ended
support for windows 7. they've ended

334
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
support for windows 7. they've ended
 

335
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,590
support for windows 7. they've ended
support for windows xp

336
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600

1305
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,350
in your usb
cable to charge your phone but then all

of a sudden people got
 

1309
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,909
of a sudden people got
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports

1310
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports
 

1311
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,350
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports
could be malicious

1312
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
could be malicious
 

1313
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,149
could be malicious
because usb also carries data or that's

1314
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
because usb also carries data or that's
 

1315
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,510
because usb also carries data or that's
right who knows if it's

right who knows if it's
 

1317
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,590
right who knows if it's
too many volts and that you know maybe

1318
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
too many volts and that you know maybe
 

1319
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,750
too many volts and that you know maybe
it's got a short or something like that

1320
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,760
it's got a short or something like that
 

1321
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,350
it's got a short or something like that
and could fry my phone

1322
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
and could fry my phone
 

1323
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,029
and could fry my phone
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to

1324
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to
 

1325
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,430
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to
plug into the usb port because hey it

1326
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
plug into the usb port because hey it
 

1327
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,390
plug into the usb port because hey it
could be

1328
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
could be
 

1329
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,350
could be
something bad that's right well wireless

1330
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
something bad that's right well wireless
 

1331

charging you

1332
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
charging you
 

1333
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,710
charging you
set it down it charges and you pick it

1334
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
set it down it charges and you pick it
 

1335
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,230
set it down it charges and you pick it
up and you're done yeah

1336
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
up and you're done yeah
 

1337
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,630
up and you're done yeah
but you can set it down for like three

1338
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
but you can set it down for like three
 

1339
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,990
but you can set it down for like three
minutes and it's given you enough of a

1340
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
minutes and it's given you enough of a
 

1341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,190
minutes and it's given you enough of a
charge to get through most of the

1342
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
charge to get through most of the
 

1343

just as a i mean you look around now and
 

1349
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,149
just as a i mean you look around now and
you've got all these charge stations

things i like the idea of
 

1529
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,750
things i like the idea of
cluster computing and that's where you

1530
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
cluster computing and that's where you
 

1531
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,549
cluster computing and that's where you
take

1532
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
take
 

1533
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,510
take
several computers connect them together

through networking
 

1537
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,830
through networking
and basically install

1538
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
and basically install
 

1539
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,390
and basically install
software beowulf or something like that

1540
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
software beowulf or something like that
 

1541
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,630
software beowulf or something like that
that clusters them to make them be able

1542
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
that clusters them to make them be able
 

1543
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,510
that clusters them to make them be able
to perform

1544

to perform
 

1545
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,470
to perform
tasks together in such a way that it

tasks together in such a way that it
 

1547
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,549
tasks together in such a way that it
basically makes a super computer

1548
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
basically makes a super computer
 

1549
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,110
basically makes a super computer
right out of several computers so you

1550
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
right out of several computers so you
 

1551
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,269
right out of several computers so you
think about these raspberry pi

1552
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
think about these raspberry pi
 

1553
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,789

cl uh cluster or the modules

1554
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
cl uh cluster or the modules
 

1555
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,909
cl uh cluster or the modules
and and put like 10 of those together

1556
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:21,919
and and put like 10 of those together
 

1557
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,430
and and put like 10 of those together
in a a cluster and you'd have like this

1558
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
in a a cluster and you'd have like this
 

1559
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,549
in a a cluster and you'd have like this
compute module

00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
could i automate like some of the
 

1595
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,549
could i automate like some of the
utilities that i have in the kitchen to

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
yeah it takes more than that but i know
 

1605
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,590
yeah it takes more than that but i know
it could be the brains of such an

1606
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
it could be the brains of such an
 

1607
