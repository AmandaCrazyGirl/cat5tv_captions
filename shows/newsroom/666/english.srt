like
 

329
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,990
like
pick somewhere along the equator of

330
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
pick somewhere along the equator of
 

331
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,350
pick somewhere along the equator of
africa maybe

332
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
africa maybe
 

333
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,270
africa maybe
you know like some remote well it makes

334
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
you know like some remote well it makes
 

335
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,870
you know like some remote well it makes
sense though that they would want to

336
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
sense though that they would want to
 

337
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,749
sense though that they would want to
test it in a place where well think of

338
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
test it in a place where well think of
 

339
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,710
test it in a place where well think of
it this way

340
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
it this way
 

341
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,350
it this way
if if it went down i have something else

342
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
if if it went down i have something else
 

343
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,990
if if it went down i have something else
to fall back

344
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
to fall back
 

345
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,310
to fall back
on yeah i have the 4g infrastructure to

346
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
on yeah i have the 4g infrastructure to
 

347
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,150
on yeah i have the 4g infrastructure to
fall back on if i need it

348
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
fall back on if i need it
 

349
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,990
fall back on if i need it
so maybe that has something to do with

350
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
so maybe that has something to do with
 

351
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,390
so maybe that has something to do with
it i mean we're speculating here but

352
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
it i mean we're speculating here but
 

353
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,469
it i mean we're speculating here but
there there are so many thoughts yeah

354
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
there there are so many thoughts yeah
 

355
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,590
there there are so many thoughts yeah
but hey how

356
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
but hey how
 

357
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,070
but hey how
how does something like starlink affect

358
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
how does something like starlink affect
 

359
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,590
how does something like starlink affect
you is it something that would be better

360
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
you is it something that would be better
 

361
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,270
you is it something that would be better
than what you have or is it

362
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
than what you have or is it
 

363
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,990
than what you have or is it
a severe downgrade that's really what it

364
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
a severe downgrade that's really what it
 

365
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,749
a severe downgrade that's really what it
comes down to but i think in a lot of

366
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
comes down to but i think in a lot of
 

367
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,670
comes down to but i think in a lot of
cases this is going to bring

368
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
cases this is going to bring
 

369
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,189
cases this is going to bring
high-speed internet to areas that

370
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
high-speed internet to areas that
 

371
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,710
high-speed internet to areas that
currently don't have it and not only

372
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
currently don't have it and not only

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,430
that jeff
but we've hit on it in the past when

yes right now one of the things that

yes right now one of the things that
 

395
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,710
yes right now one of the things that
will be interesting is because

will be interesting is because
 

397
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,870
will be interesting is because
i mean this is not new like satellite

398
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
i mean this is not new like satellite
 

399
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,749
i mean this is not new like satellite
internet

internet
 

401
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,990

is already well good satellite internet
 

403
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,189
is already well good satellite internet
what's new that's

404
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
what's new that's
 

405
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,309
what's new that's
that's the challenge here is uh i mean i

406

that's the challenge here is uh i mean i
 

407
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,510
that's the challenge here is uh i mean i
used to

408
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
used to
 

409
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,070
used to
another iteration of my working life i

410
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
another iteration of my working life i
 

411
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,790
another iteration of my working life i
was a

412
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
was a
 

413
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,589
was a
uh a recognized installer for satellite

414
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
uh a recognized installer for satellite
 

415
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,550
uh a recognized installer for satellite
internet

416

internet
 

417
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,670
internet
um so i have an inner working of or an

418
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
um so i have an inner working of or an
 

419
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,670
um so i have an inner working of or an
inner understanding of how it works and

420
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
inner understanding of how it works and
 

421
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,189
inner understanding of how it works and
it was quite

422
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
it was quite
 

423
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,270
it was quite
uh cumbersome and unreliable yep i mean

424
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
uh cumbersome and unreliable yep i mean
 

425
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,110
uh cumbersome and unreliable yep i mean
the dish moves just a slight bit from

426
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
the dish moves just a slight bit from
 

427
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,950
the dish moves just a slight bit from
wind right and you're out

428
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960

429
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,350

so i'm really interested to see how

430
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
so i'm really interested to see how
 

431
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,070
so i'm really interested to see how
starlink's internet works in that regard

432
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
starlink's internet works in that regard
 

433
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,589
starlink's internet works in that regard
and if a little bit of wind

434
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
and if a little bit of wind
 

435
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,110
and if a little bit of wind
is going to knock it out or if it's a

436
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
is going to knock it out or if it's a
 

437
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
is going to knock it out or if it's a
more stable platform

438
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
more stable platform
 

439
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,950
more stable platform
time will tell maybe the beta test will

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
time will tell maybe the beta test will
 

441
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,550
time will tell maybe the beta test will
show some results so we'll see over the

show some results so we'll see over the

is for me extremely bullish not

862
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
is for me extremely bullish not
 

863

financial advice
 

865
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,509
financial advice
but for me that's a bullish sign so

but for me that's a bullish sign so
 

867
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,069
but for me that's a bullish sign so
um yeah one thing i'd like to focus on

868
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
um yeah one thing i'd like to focus on
 

869
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,389
um yeah one thing i'd like to focus on
is it's a question that a lot of people

870
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
is it's a question that a lot of people
 

871
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,189
is it's a question that a lot of people
are asking

872
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
are asking
 

873
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,550
are asking
us in regards to private keys and

874
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
us in regards to private keys and
 

875
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,389
us in regards to private keys and
public keys so i'd like to spend a few

876
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
public keys so i'd like to spend a few
 

877
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,949
public keys so i'd like to spend a few
minutes on that subject

878
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
minutes on that subject
 

879
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,710
minutes on that subject
and for that i pulled up a website

880
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
and for that i pulled up a website
 

881
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,150
and for that i pulled up a website
called ian callman.io because this is

882
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
called ian callman.io because this is
 

883
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,430
called ian callman.io because this is
uses um the web the

884
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
uses um the web the
 

885
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,550
uses um the web the
the content fantastically well and uh

886
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
the content fantastically well and uh
 

887
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,189
the content fantastically well and uh
so there's somebody in bitcoin or team

888
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
so there's somebody in bitcoin or team
 

889
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,470
so there's somebody in bitcoin or team
that came up with

890
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
that came up with
 

891
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,670
that came up with
this process of how to convert

892
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
this process of how to convert
 

893
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,470
this process of how to convert
a private key into a public key and they

894
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
a private key into a public key and they
 

895
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,710
a private key into a public key and they
expanded that and now a lot of

896
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
expanded that and now a lot of
 

897
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,470
expanded that and now a lot of
different cryptocurrencies are using the

898
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
different cryptocurrencies are using the
 

899
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,150
different cryptocurrencies are using the
same process and that's why it's called

900
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
same process and that's why it's called
 

901
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,110
same process and that's why it's called
bip 39 or bip 44

902
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
bip 39 or bip 44
 

903
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,389
bip 39 or bip 44
because this bitcoin improvement

904
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
because this bitcoin improvement
 

905
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,829
because this bitcoin improvement
protocol but other

906
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
protocol but other
 

907
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,350
protocol but other
uh currencies are using that so i just

908
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
uh currencies are using that so i just
 

909
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,150
uh currencies are using that so i just
gen clicked on generated on 24 words

910
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
gen clicked on generated on 24 words
 

911
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,189
gen clicked on generated on 24 words
and so out of a repository uh the system

912
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
and so out of a repository uh the system
 

913
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,710
and so out of a repository uh the system
generated 24 words and

914
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
generated 24 words and
 

915
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,389
generated 24 words and
that those are the words that you need

916
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
that those are the words that you need
 

917
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,710
that those are the words that you need
to remember when you generate

918
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
to remember when you generate
 

919
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,430
to remember when you generate
a wallet for example you create a new

920
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
a wallet for example you create a new
 

921
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,550
a wallet for example you create a new
wallet

922
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
wallet
 

923
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,150
wallet
the wallet will generate those 24 words

924
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
the wallet will generate those 24 words
 

925
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,509
the wallet will generate those 24 words
and those are the ones that you have to

926
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
and those are the ones that you have to
 

927
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,189
and those are the ones that you have to
remember because everything

928
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
remember because everything
 

929
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,710
remember because everything
derives from those 24 words so with

930
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
derives from those 24 words so with
 

931
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,550
derives from those 24 words so with
a little bit this little bit technical

932
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
a little bit this little bit technical
 

933
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,189
a little bit this little bit technical
here but from those 24 words

934
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
here but from those 24 words
 

935
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,509
here but from those 24 words
we deduct the private key from that

936
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
we deduct the private key from that
 

937
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,509
we deduct the private key from that
private key we deduct the public key and

938
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
private key we deduct the public key and
 

939
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,350
private key we deduct the public key and
that public key and then generates the

940
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
that public key and then generates the
 

941
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,389
that public key and then generates the
address

942
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
address
 

943
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,110
address
yeah so and the reason that is done is

944
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
yeah so and the reason that is done is
 

945
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,870
yeah so and the reason that is done is
that there is no way in the world that

946
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
that there is no way in the world that
 

947
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,389
that there is no way in the world that
you can get back to the private key

948
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
you can get back to the private key
 

949
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,829
you can get back to the private key
that's why

950
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
that's why
 

951
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,790
that's why
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so

952
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so
 

953
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,470
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so
what you do is you take the private key

954
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
what you do is you take the private key
 

955
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,710
what you do is you take the private key
you hash it that's a special

956
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
you hash it that's a special
 

957
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,909
you hash it that's a special
crypto cryptographic process and with

958
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
crypto cryptographic process and with
 

959
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,909
crypto cryptographic process and with
that you generate the public key

960
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
that you generate the public key
 

961
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,829
that you generate the public key
and the public key is hashed twice and

962
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
and the public key is hashed twice and
 

963
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,350
and the public key is hashed twice and
that generates the address

964
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
that generates the address
 

965
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,590
that generates the address
the reason that this is done is that

966
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
the reason that this is done is that
 

967
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,230
the reason that this is done is that
there might be future some computers

968
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
there might be future some computers
 

969
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,429
there might be future some computers
that are able to deduct from the public

970
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
that are able to deduct from the public
 

971
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,630
that are able to deduct from the public
key the private key

972
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
key the private key
 

973
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,909
key the private key
there don't exist yet but we're thinking

974
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
there don't exist yet but we're thinking
 

975
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,309
there don't exist yet but we're thinking
well ahead in the future and that's why

976
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
well ahead in the future and that's why
 

977
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,150
well ahead in the future and that's why
we are using the address as

978
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
we are using the address as
 

979
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,750
we are using the address as
the key that you send to other people

980
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
the key that you send to other people
 

981
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,070
the key that you send to other people
in case you want to receive some bitcoin

982
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
in case you want to receive some bitcoin
 

983
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,870
in case you want to receive some bitcoin
