00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,469
this is something that's actually coming
to pass well that this is the number one

336

to pass well that this is the number one
 

337
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,510
to pass well that this is the number one
thing because

338
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
thing because
 

339
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,070
thing because
with in respect to green technology the

340
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
with in respect to green technology the
 

341
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,590
with in respect to green technology the
big the largest thing that's been

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
big the largest thing that's been
 

343
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,629
big the largest thing that's been
lagging behind

344
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
lagging behind
 

345
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,070
lagging behind
is definitely being able to store that

346
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
is definitely being able to store that
 

347
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,590
is definitely being able to store that
energy because again we do have these

348
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
energy because again we do have these
 

349

but the issue is where do you store all

352
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
but the issue is where do you store all
 

353
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,870
but the issue is where do you store all
that where do you put it yeah so this

354
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
that where do you put it yeah so this
 

355
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,550
that where do you put it yeah so this
can definitely be one of those solutions

356

can definitely be one of those solutions
 

357
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,150
can definitely be one of those solutions
that can help us

358
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
that can help us
 

359
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,309
that can help us
help turn our economy our world into a

360

then here this is the little blip with
 

581
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,389

were significantly higher and if you

588
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
were significantly higher and if you
 

589
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,110
were significantly higher and if you
consider that we are how many people are

590
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
consider that we are how many people are
 

591
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,630
consider that we are how many people are
we using the ethereum blockchain

592
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
we using the ethereum blockchain
 

593
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,110
we using the ethereum blockchain
let's say 100 000 200 000 it won't be

594
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
let's say 100 000 200 000 it won't be
 

595
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,110
let's say 100 000 200 000 it won't be
much more than that

596
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
much more than that
 

597
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,230
much more than that
so if 200 000 can already

598
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
so if 200 000 can already
 

599
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,190
so if 200 000 can already
bring the blockchain uh in regards to

600
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
bring the blockchain uh in regards to
 

601
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,949
bring the blockchain uh in regards to
fees to a halt

602

fees to a halt
 

603
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,710

how would that look like if we have got

604
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
how would that look like if we have got
 

605
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,790
how would that look like if we have got
certainly 20 million people using this

606
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
certainly 20 million people using this
 

607
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,509
certainly 20 million people using this
chain

608
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
chain
 

609
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,750
chain
it will not be feasible any longer and

610
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
it will not be feasible any longer and
 

611
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,910
it will not be feasible any longer and
that's why

612
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
that's why
 

613
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,829
that's why
including also some other reasons a long

614
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
including also some other reasons a long
 

615
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,790
including also some other reasons a long
time ago the idea of your theorem 2.0

616
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
time ago the idea of your theorem 2.0
 

617
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,829
time ago the idea of your theorem 2.0
was started

618
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
was started
 

619
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,910
was started
and it taking it's it's taking its time

620
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
and it taking it's it's taking its time
 

621
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,870
and it taking it's it's taking its time
and why

622
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
and why
 

623
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,110
and why
because coding and programming is not

624
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
because coding and programming is not
 

625
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,870
because coding and programming is not
simple yeah if you have got a company

626
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
simple yeah if you have got a company
 

627
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,190
simple yeah if you have got a company
like

628
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
like
 

629
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,710
like
apple or google where everything is

630
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
apple or google where everything is
 

631
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,190

633
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,870
under one roof everything is coordinated
in a different way

634
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
in a different way
 

635
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,630
in a different way
you can have a different type of

636
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
you can have a different type of
 

637
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,110
you can have a different type of
transparency and

638
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
transparency and
 

639
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,310
transparency and
and also objectives but if you have got

640
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
and also objectives but if you have got
 

641
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,710
and also objectives but if you have got
a team of 400 people that are

642
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
a team of 400 people that are
 

643
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,829
a team of 400 people that are
coordinated

644
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
coordinated
 

645
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,069
coordinated
through something like github yeah so

646
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
through something like github yeah so
 

647
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,269
through something like github yeah so
this github is where

648
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
this github is where
 

649
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,350
this github is where
everything happens in regards to

650
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
everything happens in regards to
 

651
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,389
everything happens in regards to
ethereum

652
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399

653
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,710

then it looks very it's very complex and

654
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
then it looks very it's very complex and
 

655
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,069
then it looks very it's very complex and
so everything has to be done very

656
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
so everything has to be done very
 

657
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,750
so everything has to be done very
meticulously

658
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
meticulously
 

659
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,910
meticulously
because we're talking about money here

660
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
because we're talking about money here
 

661
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,910
because we're talking about money here
in this case

662
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
in this case
 

663
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,230
in this case
money transfer so big mistakes will cost

664
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
money transfer so big mistakes will cost
 

665
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,750
money transfer so big mistakes will cost
a lot of money as we've seen

666
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
a lot of money as we've seen
 

667
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,630
a lot of money as we've seen
in defile and we've got over in the

668
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
in defile and we've got over in the
 

669
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,509
in defile and we've got over in the
ethereum current

670
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
ethereum current
 

671
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,269
ethereum current
blockchain we've got over 244

672
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
blockchain we've got over 244
 

673
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,550
blockchain we've got over 244
repositories

674
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
repositories
 

675
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,670
repositories
over 500 people programming

676
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
over 500 people programming
 

677
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,509
over 500 people programming
so you can imagine how complex this

678
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
so you can imagine how complex this
 

679
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,030
so you can imagine how complex this
whole thing is yeah there are many

680
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
whole thing is yeah there are many
 

681
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,949
whole thing is yeah there are many
hundred thousand lines of code

682
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
hundred thousand lines of code
 

683
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,269
hundred thousand lines of code
that need to be coordinated that's why

684
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
that need to be coordinated that's why
 

685
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,310
that need to be coordinated that's why
this thing takes

686
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
this thing takes
 

687
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,470
this thing takes
so long now looking at the road map

688
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
so long now looking at the road map
 

689
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,590
so long now looking at the road map
um this is the roadmap of

690
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
um this is the roadmap of
 

691
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,030
um this is the roadmap of
the of eth 2.0

692
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
the of eth 2.0
 

693
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,790
the of eth 2.0
so this is the current chain here so

694
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
so this is the current chain here so
 

695
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,550
so this is the current chain here so
this is 1.0

696
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
this is 1.0
 

697
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,110
this is 1.0
that's the theorem you and i know and

698
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
that's the theorem you and i know and
 

699
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,870
that's the theorem you and i know and
soon we will have the beacon chain

700
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
soon we will have the beacon chain
 

701
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,990
soon we will have the beacon chain
which is the start of ethereum 2.0

702
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
which is the start of ethereum 2.0
 

703
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,750
which is the start of ethereum 2.0
and this here is like the current chain

704
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
and this here is like the current chain
 

705
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,150
and this here is like the current chain
without proof of work so proof of stake

706
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
without proof of work so proof of stake
 

707
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,430
without proof of work so proof of stake
and you will not have any smart

708
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
and you will not have any smart
 

709
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,030
and you will not have any smart
contracts in this

710
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
contracts in this
 

711
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,670
contracts in this
phase zero from there we will start with

712
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
phase zero from there we will start with
 

713
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,150
phase zero from there we will start with
the fa

714
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
the fa
 

715
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,629
the fa
with this smart contracts but we'll have

716
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
with this smart contracts but we'll have
 

717
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,550
with this smart contracts but we'll have
shards and charts i like

718
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
shards and charts i like
 

719
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,670
shards and charts i like
just imagine a very simple way like sub

720
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
just imagine a very simple way like sub
 

721
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,310
just imagine a very simple way like sub
blockchain so you'll have a chain for

722
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
blockchain so you'll have a chain for
 

723
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,110
blockchain so you'll have a chain for
let's say

724
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
let's say
 

725
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,910
let's say
uh defy you'll have a chain that's that

726
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
uh defy you'll have a chain that's that
 

727
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,150
uh defy you'll have a chain that's that
needs to be secured in a special way

728
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
needs to be secured in a special way
 

729
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,470
needs to be secured in a special way
then you've got a new chain for uh

730
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
then you've got a new chain for uh
 

731
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,430
then you've got a new chain for uh
gamers

732
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
gamers
 

733
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,750
gamers
so when something happens like with

734
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
so when something happens like with
 

735
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,910
so when something happens like with
cryptokitties where suddenly

736
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
cryptokitties where suddenly
 

737
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,069
cryptokitties where suddenly
the chain was blocked it will be only

738
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
the chain was blocked it will be only
 

739
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,829
the chain was blocked it will be only
that chain that will be blocked at that

740
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
that chain that will be blocked at that
 

741
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,470
that chain that will be blocked at that
time

742
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
time
 

743
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,990
time
and the fees will not go through the

744
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
and the fees will not go through the
 

745
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,590
and the fees will not go through the
roof so there are

746
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
roof so there are
 

747
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,750
roof so there are
lots of little improvements coming also

748
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
lots of little improvements coming also
 

749
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,430
lots of little improvements coming also
along

750
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
along
 

751
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,230
along
with this 2.0 and the roadmap in detail

752
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
with this 2.0 and the roadmap in detail
 

753
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,470
with this 2.0 and the roadmap in detail
just the ones that we hear today and we

754
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
just the ones that we hear today and we
 

755
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,750
just the ones that we hear today and we
will start soon

756
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
will start soon
 

757
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,750
will start soon
phase zero uh phase zero means uh

758
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
phase zero uh phase zero means uh
 

759
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,590
phase zero uh phase zero means uh
moving away from proof of work to proof

760
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
moving away from proof of work to proof
 

761
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,350
moving away from proof of work to proof
of stake and that's done

762
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
of stake and that's done
 

763
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,350
of stake and that's done
by having a deposit contract because you

764
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
by having a deposit contract because you
 

765
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,949
by having a deposit contract because you
need to secure the network not through

766
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
need to secure the network not through
 

767
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,550
need to secure the network not through
miners so people

768
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
miners so people
 

769
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,310
miners so people
that are mining you need to secure it

770
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
that are mining you need to secure it
 

771
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,750
that are mining you need to secure it
through value

772
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
through value
 

773
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,790
through value
and that for that the deposit contract

774
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
and that for that the deposit contract
 

775
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,670
and that for that the deposit contract
was now

776
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
was now
 

777
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,629
was now
created and the time is running now

778
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
created and the time is running now
 

779
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,910
created and the time is running now
until the

780
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
until the
 

781
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,190
until the
7th of december where then the beacon

782
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
7th of december where then the beacon
 

783
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,710
7th of december where then the beacon
chain will be started

784
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
chain will be started
 

785
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,790
chain will be started
from there we will then go over to phase

786
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
from there we will then go over to phase
 

787
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,870
from there we will then go over to phase
0 and then much later phase 2

788
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
0 and then much later phase 2
 

789
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,590
0 and then much later phase 2
and phase three and at this stage you

790
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
and phase three and at this stage you
 

791
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,190
and phase three and at this stage you
there will be also no more proof of work

792
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
there will be also no more proof of work
 

793
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,470
there will be also no more proof of work
so the current

794
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
so the current
 

795
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,230
so the current
blockchain that you know is point zero

796
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
blockchain that you know is point zero
 

797
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,910
blockchain that you know is point zero
will be more or less switched off that's

798
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
will be more or less switched off that's
 

799
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,509
will be more or less switched off that's
not possible i know but

800
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
not possible i know but
 

801
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,430
not possible i know but
it it will not continue everything will

802
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
it it will not continue everything will
 

803
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,870
it it will not continue everything will
happen in the new

804
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
happen in the new
 

805
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,910
happen in the new
uh ethereum 2.0

806
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
uh ethereum 2.0
 

807
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,790
uh ethereum 2.0
and um for the transition from the

808
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
and um for the transition from the
 

809
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,629
and um for the transition from the
current status to ethernet

810
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
current status to ethernet
 

811
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,430
current status to ethernet
uh phase zero they created a very good

812
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
uh phase zero they created a very good
 

813
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,389
uh phase zero they created a very good
