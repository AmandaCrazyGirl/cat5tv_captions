00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.540 align:start position:0%

okay

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.870 align:start position:0%
okay
so<00:03:45.760><c> put</c><00:03:46.240><c> that</c><00:03:46.270><c> so</c><00:03:46.810><c> I</c><00:03:46.840><c> yeah</c><00:03:47.650><c> it</c><00:03:47.770><c> was</c><00:03:47.920><c> good</c><00:03:48.250><c> but</c><00:03:48.610><c> I</c>

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
so put that so I yeah it was good but I
 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.790 align:start position:0%
so put that so I yeah it was good but I
wouldn't<00:03:49.510><c> go</c><00:03:49.810><c> out</c><00:03:49.840><c> of</c><00:03:50.020><c> my</c><00:03:50.110><c> way</c><00:03:50.260><c> to</c><00:03:50.320><c> buy</c><00:03:50.560><c> it</c>

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go out of my way to buy it
 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go out of my way to buy it
personally<00:03:51.310><c> but</c><00:03:51.760><c> if</c><00:03:51.940><c> you</c><00:03:52.120><c> were</c><00:03:52.300><c> a</c><00:03:52.330><c> vegetarian</c>

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 align:start position:0%
personally but if you were a vegetarian
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
personally but if you were a vegetarian
or<00:03:53.230><c> a</c><00:03:53.260><c> vegan</c><00:03:53.320><c> and</c><00:03:53.890><c> they</c><00:03:54.340><c> did</c><00:03:54.520><c> an</c><00:03:54.610><c> alternative</c>

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 align:start position:0%
or a vegan and they did an alternative
 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.930 align:start position:0%
or a vegan and they did an alternative
then<00:03:55.450><c> that's</c><00:03:55.900><c> a</c><00:03:56.020><c> reasonable</c><00:03:56.860><c> alternative</c><00:03:57.010><c> and</c>

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 align:start position:0%
then that's a reasonable alternative and
 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.390 align:start position:0%
then that's a reasonable alternative and
I<00:03:58.360><c> mean</c><00:03:58.540><c> if</c><00:03:58.750><c> in</c><00:03:59.110><c> China</c><00:03:59.380><c> they're</c><00:03:59.590><c> having</c><00:03:59.890><c> a</c><00:04:00.010><c> big</c>

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
I mean if in China they're having a big
 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
I mean if in China they're having a big
pork<00:04:00.730><c> shortage</c><00:04:01.330><c> this</c><00:04:01.810><c> is</c><00:04:01.990><c> it</c><00:04:02.200><c> and</c><00:04:02.530><c> they</c><00:04:03.459><c> use</c>

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 align:start position:0%
pork shortage this is it and they use
 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
pork shortage this is it and they use
full<00:04:04.120><c> flavor</c><00:04:04.890><c> dishes</c><00:04:05.890><c> right</c><00:04:06.280><c> so</c><00:04:06.610><c> I</c><00:04:06.940><c> think</c><00:04:06.970><c> that</c>

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 align:start position:0%
full flavor dishes right so I think that
 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
full flavor dishes right so I think that
