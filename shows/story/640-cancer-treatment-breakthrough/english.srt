00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:56,629
annihilates any trace of it I just
 

165
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,140
annihilates any trace of it I just
cannot wait I don't really like does

166
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,150
cannot wait I don't really like does
 

167
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,939
cannot wait I don't really like does
anyone else feel that like excitement

168
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:01,949
anyone else feel that like excitement
 

169
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,580
anyone else feel that like excitement
and the anticipation like could it be

170
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:04,590
and the anticipation like could it be
 

171
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,569
and the anticipation like could it be
like could that be possible and all

172
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:08,579
like could that be possible and all
 

173
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,759
like could that be possible and all
they're doing is taking the t-cell that

174
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:10,769
they're doing is taking the t-cell that
 

175
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,280
they're doing is taking the t-cell that
you already produce out and they're just

176
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,290
you already produce out and they're just
 

177
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,020
you already produce out and they're just
replicating it like they're kind of

178
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,030
replicating it like they're kind of
 

179
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,879
replicating it like they're kind of
growing more on their own they're

180
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:16,889
growing more on their own they're
 

181
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,469
growing more on their own they're
altering it to put in the receptor to

182
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
altering it to put in the receptor to
 

183
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,749
altering it to put in the receptor to
find the cancer cells so that's a bit of

184
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:20,759
find the cancer cells so that's a bit of
 

185
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,580
find the cancer cells so that's a bit of
a genetic modification and then they're

186
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:22,590
a genetic modification and then they're
 

187
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,370
a genetic modification and then they're
culturing more so there can't be adverse

188
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:25,380
culturing more so there can't be adverse
 

189
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,720
culturing more so there can't be adverse
reactions because

190
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:26,730
reactions because
 

191
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,290
reactions because
your own sure I mean I don't understand

192
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,300
your own sure I mean I don't understand
 

193
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,700
your own sure I mean I don't understand
the science Ike yeah pretend to

194
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:31,710
the science Ike yeah pretend to
 

195
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,010
the science Ike yeah pretend to
understand the science but I know there

196
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,020
understand the science but I know there
 

197
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,970
understand the science but I know there
was a time in our history when

198
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:36,980
was a time in our history when
 

199
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,400
was a time in our history when
penicillin didn't exist and when and

200
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,410
penicillin didn't exist and when and
 

201
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,730
penicillin didn't exist and when and
when it was discovered if you will that

202
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:43,740
when it was discovered if you will that
 

203
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,480
when it was discovered if you will that
was a mistake

204
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,490
was a mistake
 

205
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,070
was a mistake
yeah but so so when it was accidentally

206
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
yeah but so so when it was accidentally
 

207
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,180
yeah but so so when it was accidentally
discovered how earth-shatteringly like

208
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,190
discovered how earth-shatteringly like
 

209
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,000
discovered how earth-shatteringly like
how many lives were saved how many lives

210
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,010
how many lives were saved how many lives
 

211
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,250
how many lives were saved how many lives
were improved because of it it's you

212
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:58,260
were improved because of it it's you
 

213
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,450
were improved because of it it's you
know what I was having a conversation

214
00:04:59,450 --> 00:04:59,460
know what I was having a conversation
 

215
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,940
know what I was having a conversation
with one of my clients the other day and

216
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:01,950
with one of my clients the other day and
 

217
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,740
with one of my clients the other day and
her older siblings were born before

218
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:03,750
her older siblings were born before
 

219
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,490
her older siblings were born before
penicillin oh wow he said the reason I'm

220
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,500
penicillin oh wow he said the reason I'm
 

221
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,370
penicillin oh wow he said the reason I'm
not deaf is because penicillin existed

222
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,380
not deaf is because penicillin existed
 

223
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,070
not deaf is because penicillin existed
for me and not for my brothers Wow right

224
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,080
for me and not for my brothers Wow right
 

225
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,050
for me and not for my brothers Wow right
so heartbreaking right yet at the same

226
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,060
so heartbreaking right yet at the same
 

227
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,690
so heartbreaking right yet at the same
time it's like dawn of a new era

228
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:17,700
time it's like dawn of a new era
 

229
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,050
time it's like dawn of a new era
yeah right it's very cool so are we at

230
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,060
yeah right it's very cool so are we at
 

231
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,240
yeah right it's very cool so are we at
that point with cancer I don't think we

232
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,250
that point with cancer I don't think we
 

233
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,000
that point with cancer I don't think we
are but I'm hopeful I'm like I'm so

234
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,010
are but I'm hopeful I'm like I'm so
 

235
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,180
are but I'm hopeful I'm like I'm so

hopeful in humanity and and our our
 

237
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,270
hopeful in humanity and and our our
ability to accomplish that because I
