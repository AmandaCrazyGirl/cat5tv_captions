93 95 we can say that but I mean it no

76
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:47,460
93 95 we can say that but I mean it no
 

77
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,069
93 95 we can say that but I mean it no
it did feel like they were giving it an

78
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,079
it did feel like they were giving it an
 

79
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,340
it did feel like they were giving it an
effort but at one point they had the

80
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,350
effort but at one point they had the
 

81
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,370
effort but at one point they had the
better team they had the the testing

82
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:55,380
better team they had the the testing
 

83
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,340
better team they had the the testing
team before patches went out and but

84
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,350
team before patches went out and but
 

85
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,380
team before patches went out and but
stuff like this and having to wait for

86
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:00,390
stuff like this and having to wait for
 

87
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,130
stuff like this and having to wait for
weeks for it's actively exploited yes

88
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
weeks for it's actively exploited yes
 

89
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,920
weeks for it's actively exploited yes
yes that is a takeover bug like this is

90
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:06,930
yes that is a takeover bug like this is
 

91
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,389
yes that is a takeover bug like this is
something that could completely

92
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
something that could completely
 

93
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,850
something that could completely
compromise an entire network of machines

94
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:10,860
compromise an entire network of machines
 

95
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,380
compromise an entire network of machines
and so if

96
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,390
and so if
 

97
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,710
and so if
somebody a miscreant knows of the

98
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:15,720
somebody a miscreant knows of the
 

99
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,559
somebody a miscreant knows of the
vulnerability within let's say a

100
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:18,569
vulnerability within let's say a
 

101
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,250
vulnerability within let's say a
business network and actively exploits

102
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,260
business network and actively exploits
 

103
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,620
business network and actively exploits
it because it is like understand folks

104
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:24,630
it because it is like understand folks
 

105
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,620
it because it is like understand folks
this is an exploit that is currently

106
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:27,630
this is an exploit that is currently
 

107
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,540
this is an exploit that is currently
being used by hackers to infiltrate

108
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,550
being used by hackers to infiltrate
 

109
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,320
being used by hackers to infiltrate
networks it is currently being used so

110
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,330
networks it is currently being used so
 

111
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,330
networks it is currently being used so
if that's the case wouldn't it be

112
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:38,340
if that's the case wouldn't it be
 

113
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,970
if that's the case wouldn't it be
prudent for a company like Microsoft to

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:40,980
prudent for a company like Microsoft to
 

115
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,240
prudent for a company like Microsoft to
say we need to fix this and we need to

116
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,250
say we need to fix this and we need to
 

117
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,740
say we need to fix this and we need to
fix this now yes instead they're waiting

118
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:48,750
fix this now yes instead they're waiting
 

119
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,670
fix this now yes instead they're waiting
a month at least at least four weeks I

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:52,680
a month at least at least four weeks I
 

121
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,530
a month at least at least four weeks I
mean we're talking the the second

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:54,540
mean we're talking the the second

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,190
mean we're talking the the second
Tuesday of February why four weeks

124
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
Tuesday of February why four weeks
 

125
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,009
Tuesday of February why four weeks
though like why that's that's arbitrary

126
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:01,019
though like why that's that's arbitrary
 

127
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,050
though like why that's that's arbitrary
it's just the second Tuesday of every

128
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,060
it's just the second Tuesday of every
 

129
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,490
it's just the second Tuesday of every
month is when they issue their patches

130
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:04,500
month is when they issue their patches
 

131
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,940
month is when they issue their patches
well I get that but yeah why not push

132
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:07,950
well I get that but yeah why not push
 

133
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,210
well I get that but yeah why not push
through an update because they don't

134
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,220
through an update because they don't
 

135
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,210
through an update because they don't
because it's the rollout happens on it

136
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,220
because it's the rollout happens on it
 

137
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,850
because it's the rollout happens on it
on that schedule they this is the thing

138
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:16,860
on that schedule they this is the thing
 

139
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,199
on that schedule they this is the thing
they've said that they've set themselves

140
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,209
they've said that they've set themselves
 

141
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,680
they've said that they've set themselves
up for this type of failure see I their

142
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:21,690
up for this type of failure see I their
 

143
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,780
up for this type of failure see I their
infrastructure is set up for this type

144
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:23,790
infrastructure is set up for this type
 

145
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,340
infrastructure is set up for this type
of failure now but I don't know why they

146
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,350
of failure now but I don't know why they
 

147
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,630
of failure now but I don't know why they
couldn't even just post it to their

148
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
couldn't even just post it to their
 

149
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,789
couldn't even just post it to their
website and say update manually like

150
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
website and say update manually like
 

151
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,770
website and say update manually like
nobody's gonna do it but if you unless

152

nobody's gonna do it but if you unless
 

153
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,479
nobody's gonna do it but if you unless
you know but even if you know that that

154
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:38,489
you know but even if you know that that
 

155
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,390
you know but even if you know that that
patch exists imagine if you had a

156
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,400
patch exists imagine if you had a
 

157
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,190
patch exists imagine if you had a
hundred computers and you had to

158
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
hundred computers and you had to
 

159
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,890
hundred computers and you had to
manually go like Windows infrastructure

160
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:45,900
manually go like Windows infrastructure
 

161
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,289
manually go like Windows infrastructure
right now is a brutal nightmare that's

00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:48,299
right now is a brutal nightmare that's
