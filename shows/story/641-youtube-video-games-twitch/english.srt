00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,020
can go here now what's interesting that
 

101
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,059
can go here now what's interesting that
was it talked about the fact that they

102
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:10,069
was it talked about the fact that they
 

103
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,440

111
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,050
you would normally get on YouTube it's a
really weird landscape though because we

112
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,060
