133
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,010
with this and with this technology will
be smarter is the fact that there are

134
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,020
be smarter is the fact that there are
 

135
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,140
be smarter is the fact that there are

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,000
two separate things like I'm surprised
that well you have to have a CPU you

138
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,010
that well you have to have a CPU you
 

139
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,410
that well you have to have a CPU you
have to have the ability to run

140
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,420
have to have the ability to run
 

141
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,810
have to have the ability to run
traditional code yeah otherwise you

142
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:20,820
traditional code yeah otherwise you
 

143
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,220
traditional code yeah otherwise you
wouldn't be able to like you wouldn't be

144
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,230
wouldn't be able to like you wouldn't be
 

145
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,960
wouldn't be able to like you wouldn't be
able to as a human interact with it

146
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:23,970
able to as a human interact with it
 

147
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,870
able to as a human interact with it
there has to be a layer for humans to be

148
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:26,880
there has to be a layer for humans to be
 

149
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,630
there has to be a layer for humans to be
able to access the NPU yeah hmm

150
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,640
able to access the NPU yeah hmm
 

151
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,440
able to access the NPU yeah hmm
otherwise it just blow our minds how

152
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,450
otherwise it just blow our minds how
 

153
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,060
otherwise it just blow our minds how
quickly before this would be adapted for

I don't know like because that could

160
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,490
I don't know like because that could
 

161
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,020
I don't know like because that could
change mobile computing sure it's gonna

162
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,030
change mobile computing sure it's gonna
 

163
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,330
change mobile computing sure it's gonna
change a lot of sauce that's the idea is

164
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,340
change a lot of sauce that's the idea is
 

165
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,060
change a lot of sauce that's the idea is
that it's getting faster smaller yeah

166
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,070
that it's getting faster smaller yeah
 

167
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,790
that it's getting faster smaller yeah
and more integrate that's the way

168
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:55,800
and more integrate that's the way
 

169
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,210
and more integrate that's the way
technology goes and so we're seeing a

170
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:58,220
technology goes and so we're seeing a
 

171
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,650
technology goes and so we're seeing a
massive shift in how data is processed

172
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:02,660
massive shift in how data is processed
 

173
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,430
massive shift in how data is processed
because we're specifically looking

174
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:04,440
because we're specifically looking
 

175
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,250
because we're specifically looking
toward AI and machine learning which are

176
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,260
toward AI and machine learning which are
 

177
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,440
toward AI and machine learning which are
vez
