00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,330
it or is it a whole different way of
just feels like so they're using it as

148
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:26,340
just feels like so they're using it as
 

149
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,390
just feels like so they're using it as
an elevated privilege tactic so they're

150
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,400
an elevated privilege tactic so they're
 

151
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,190
an elevated privilege tactic so they're

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,990
the hackers are using that to then be
able to elevate their privileges and do

whatever the heck they want and that's
 

177
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,610

the scary thing because how do you stop

178
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:07,620
the scary thing because how do you stop
 

179
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,570
the scary thing because how do you stop
that how can you possibly stop that I

180
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:10,580
that how can you possibly stop that I
 

181
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,150
that how can you possibly stop that I
think it comes down to where's your

thing you have to do that you can look
 

187
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,210
thing you have to do that you can look
at is how did they get in in the first

know how certificates work just because

know how certificates work just because

know how certificates work just because
I haven't delved into that but does each

I haven't delved into that but does each
 

209
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,500
I haven't delved into that but does each
certificate in each driver have its own

certificate in each driver have its own
 

211
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,250
certificate in each driver have its own
like a certificate identifier no the

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,260
like a certificate identifier no the
 

213
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,560
like a certificate identifier no the

but the company that manufactures the

216
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:50,760
but the company that manufactures the
 

217
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,740
but the company that manufactures the
driver does so that certificate says yes

218
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:54,750
driver does so that certificate says yes

to Microsoft this is a gigabyte driver

220
00:04:59,800 --> 00:04:59,810
to Microsoft this is a gigabyte driver
 

221
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,810
to Microsoft this is a gigabyte driver
provided by gigabyte because it contains

222
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:02,820
provided by gigabyte because it contains
 

223
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,630
provided by gigabyte because it contains
the certificate that proves that this is

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:05,640
the certificate that proves that this is
 

225
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,820
the certificate that proves that this is
a legitimate driver from gigabyte so

226
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:07,830
a legitimate driver from gigabyte so
 

227
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,860
a legitimate driver from gigabyte so
what if the certificate system changed

228
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:09,870
what if the certificate system changed
 

229
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,990
what if the certificate system changed
in such a way that you have your your

230
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
in such a way that you have your your
 

231
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,990
in such a way that you have your your
main certificate safer gigabyte but then

232
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,000
main certificate safer gigabyte but then
 

233
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,580
main certificate safer gigabyte but then
you have your sub certificates for each

234
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:16,590
you have your sub certificates for each
 

235
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,720
you have your sub certificates for each
driver roll out so that it identifies

this driver is this subset yeah a
developer I feel like that's your you're

240
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:28,860
developer I feel like that's your you're
 

241
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,530
developer I feel like that's your you're
giving me nightmares right now Jeff like

242
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:33,540
giving me nightmares right now Jeff like
 

243
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,330
giving me nightmares right now Jeff like
where you're going but it just sounds

244
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,340
where you're going but it just sounds
 

245
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,400
where you're going but it just sounds
like a logistical nightmare as far as

246
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,410
like a logistical nightmare as far as
 

247
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,990
like a logistical nightmare as far as
managing those certificates like it

248
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,000
managing those certificates like it
 

249
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
managing those certificates like it
could just be a nightmare I think maybe

250
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:41,510
could just be a nightmare I think maybe
 

251
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,230
could just be a nightmare I think maybe
some kind of an aristocrat is able to

252
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,240
some kind of an aristocrat is able to
 

253
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,900
some kind of an aristocrat is able to
identify maybe it's a checksum that

254
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:47,910
identify maybe it's a checksum that
 

255
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,690
identify maybe it's a checksum that
identifies known faulty drivers or

256
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:50,700
identifies known faulty drivers or
 

257
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,030
identifies known faulty drivers or
deprecated drivers so that Windows could

258
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,040
deprecated drivers so that Windows could
 

259
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,350
deprecated drivers so that Windows could
say yes this is a valid certificate

260
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,360
say yes this is a valid certificate
 

261
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,410
say yes this is a valid certificate
however gigabyte has marked this

262
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:57,420
however gigabyte has marked this
 

263
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,480
however gigabyte has marked this
certificate there this installer as bad

264
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,490
certificate there this installer as bad
 

265
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,440
certificate there this installer as bad
it's got to be some kind of an

266
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,450
it's got to be some kind of an
 

267
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,840
it's got to be some kind of an
identifier yeah it's good it'll be

268
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:05,850
identifier yeah it's good it'll be
 

269
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,159
identifier yeah it's good it'll be
interesting

270
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:07,169
interesting
 

271
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,770
interesting
yeah dude oh yeah that's the answer
