you could go to realms and stuff but the

you could go to realms and stuff but the
 

185
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,759
you could go to realms and stuff but the
difference here is yeah if you're gonna

from the choices and the graphics and

00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:10,859
from the choices and the graphics and
 

195
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,190
from the choices and the graphics and
all that kind of stuff which I think

196
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
all that kind of stuff which I think
 

197
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,530
all that kind of stuff which I think
again I don't know from firsthand would

198
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:15,540
again I don't know from firsthand would

but the the quality so you're saying
will it look as good so the quality is

00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:45,949
will it look as good so the quality is
 

219
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,920
will it look as good so the quality is
not the video the video is your my TV is

not the video the video is your my TV is
 

221
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,129
not the video the video is your my TV is
1080p so it's 1920 by 1080p regardless

we versus a Playstation 4 I'm going to

228
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:05,750
we versus a Playstation 4 I'm going to
 

229
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,420
we versus a Playstation 4 I'm going to
notice a quality difference in the

230
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:07,430
notice a quality difference in the
 

231
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,459
notice a quality difference in the
pricing and ensure it's a different

232
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:09,469
pricing and ensure it's a different
 

233
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:10,869
pricing and ensure it's a different
system in it so it is apples to oranges

234
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:10,879
system in it so it is apples to oranges
 

235
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,839
system in it so it is apples to oranges
but what I mean is the power of that

236
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:13,849
but what I mean is the power of that
 

237
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:17,140
but what I mean is the power of that
more powerful system even though my TV

238
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,150
more powerful system even though my TV
 

239
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,909
more powerful system even though my TV
never changed resolution it's still the

240
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:18,919
never changed resolution it's still the
 

241
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,330
never changed resolution it's still the
same resolution the video quality is

242
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:22,340
same resolution the video quality is
 

243
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,570
same resolution the video quality is
still the same right ok but it looks so

244
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:25,580
still the same right ok but it looks so
 

245
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,969
still the same right ok but it looks so
much better because that one is so much

246
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:27,979
much better because that one is so much
 

247
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,179
much better because that one is so much
more powerful so now take that and put

248
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:31,189
more powerful so now take that and put
 

249
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:34,209
more powerful so now take that and put
it into a cloud server where this cloud

250
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:34,219
it into a cloud server where this cloud
 

251
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:37,360
it into a cloud server where this cloud
server is still streaming 1920 by 1080 P

269
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,839
time with no latency right that's
incredible mm-hmm so now put it back and

270
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:07,849
incredible mm-hmm so now put it back and
 

271
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,570
incredible mm-hmm so now put it back and
in there that is so powerful that I can

272
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:10,580
in there that is so powerful that I can
 

273
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,790
in there that is so powerful that I can
do that on my cheap device yeah and on

274
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
do that on my cheap device yeah and on
 

275
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,709
do that on my cheap device yeah and on
any device and I can transition from

my games and the transition is happening
 

283
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,189
my games and the transition is happening
but the transitions gonna be difficult

284
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:24,199
but the transitions gonna be difficult
 

285
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,170
but the transitions gonna be difficult
for people like me who still like to go

286

hesitate even buying digital copies of
 

295
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,520
hesitate even buying digital copies of
games but I like to have the action

296
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:40,530
games but I like to have the action
 

297
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,910
games but I like to have the action

is coming up quick and I'm still gonna

300
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:46,890
is coming up quick and I'm still gonna
 

301
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,750
is coming up quick and I'm still gonna
buy a ps5 but I'm gonna also likely play

302
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,760
buy a ps5 but I'm gonna also likely play
 

303
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,000
buy a ps5 but I'm gonna also likely play
games on stadia right yeah and that's

304
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,010
games on stadia right yeah and that's
 

305
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,950
games on stadia right yeah and that's
that's an interesting point I want to

306
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
that's an interesting point I want to
 

307
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,320
that's an interesting point I want to
just reiterate what you just said which

308
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,330
just reiterate what you just said which
 

309
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,070
just reiterate what you just said which
is I'm going to also play video games on

310
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,080
is I'm going to also play video games on
 

311
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,860
is I'm going to also play video games on
stadia stadia so I don't think that

312
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:03,870
stadia stadia so I don't think that
 

313
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,230
stadia stadia so I don't think that
we're replacing that offline phone

314
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
we're replacing that offline phone
 

315
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,830
we're replacing that offline phone
device

316
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
device
 

317
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,300
device
I think we're supplementing it and say

318
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,310
I think we're supplementing it and say
 

319
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,450
I think we're supplementing it and say
it has hey now okay you can you can also

320
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,460
it has hey now okay you can you can also
 

321
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,280
it has hey now okay you can you can also
when you're connected to the Internet

322
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,290
when you're connected to the Internet
 

323
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,050
when you're connected to the Internet
play games that you can't play when

324
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,060
play games that you can't play when
 

325
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,640
play games that you can't play when
you're offline that are like high-end

326
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,650
you're offline that are like high-end
 

327
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,610
you're offline that are like high-end
yeah and that's where okay maybe this is

328
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:19,620
yeah and that's where okay maybe this is
 

329
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,820
yeah and that's where okay maybe this is
just another con another platform we all

330
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:22,830
just another con another platform we all
 

331
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,490
just another con another platform we all
have multiple plans I wonder if they'll

332
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:25,500
have multiple plans I wonder if they'll
 

333
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,909
have multiple plans I wonder if they'll
have a bit like now here's the latency

334
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
have a bit like now here's the latency
 

335
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,370
have a bit like now here's the latency
is too high for VR here cuz should I

336
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,380
is too high for VR here cuz should I
 

337
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,720
is too high for VR here cuz should I
have got to be able it's gotta be able

338
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:32,730
have got to be able it's gotta be able
 

339
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,659
have got to be able it's gotta be able
to track you with this right now so I

340
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:35,669
to track you with this right now so I
 

341
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:38,000
to track you with this right now so I
mean like you've brought up VR which you

342
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,010
mean like you've brought up VR which you
 

343
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,140
mean like you've brought up VR which you
know totally make sense our future yes

344
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,150
know totally make sense our future yes
 

345
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,970
know totally make sense our future yes
what about things like framerate

346
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:44,980
what about things like framerate
 

347
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,700
what about things like framerate
because you said 64k that's pretty good

348
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,710
because you said 64k that's pretty good
 

349
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,270
because you said 64k that's pretty good
to me no but no III hear you but you're

350
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
to me no but no III hear you but you're
 

351
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
to me no but no III hear you but you're
talking about the screen resolution I

352
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,570
talking about the screen resolution I
 

353
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,920
talking about the screen resolution I
mean if your internet can't keep up it's

354
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:55,930
mean if your internet can't keep up it's
 

355
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,390
mean if your internet can't keep up it's
gonna impact your gameplay do you

356
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:57,400
gonna impact your gameplay do you
 

357
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,980
gonna impact your gameplay do you
remember when we used to be like oh I'm

358
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,990
remember when we used to be like oh I'm
 

359
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,620
remember when we used to be like oh I'm
like I'm so bad yeah like oh yeah is

360
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:01,630
like I'm so bad yeah like oh yeah is
 

361
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,630
like I'm so bad yeah like oh yeah is
this open or to go back to lagging or my

362
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:03,640
this open or to go back to lagging or my
 

363
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,680
this open or to go back to lagging or my
car my kids gonna go well yes however

364
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,690
car my kids gonna go well yes however
 

365
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,050
car my kids gonna go well yes however
consider this as and I know we do need

366
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,060
consider this as and I know we do need
 

367
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,280
consider this as and I know we do need
to move on to the next story but

368
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,290
to move on to the next story but
 

369
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,890
to move on to the next story but
consider that the very companies that

370
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:13,900
consider that the very companies that
 

371
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,040
consider that the very companies that
are pushing the technology shift are the

372
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,050
are pushing the technology shift are the
 

373
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,800
are pushing the technology shift are the
same companies who are controlling the

374
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:19,810
same companies who are controlling the
 

375
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,680
same companies who are controlling the
introduction of like Google's gigabit

376
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:22,690
introduction of like Google's gigabit
 

377
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,000
introduction of like Google's gigabit
fiber to the home right right so yeah if

378
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,010
fiber to the home right right so yeah if
 

379
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,070
fiber to the home right right so yeah if
that's the case oh you know it's gonna

380
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,080
that's the case oh you know it's gonna
 

381
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,070
that's the case oh you know it's gonna
perform well it's like you you just know

382
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
perform well it's like you you just know
 

383
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
perform well it's like you you just know
that that's what they're driving toward

384
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:33,610
that that's what they're driving toward
 

385
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,909
that that's what they're driving toward
and and they're not gonna build a

386
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
and and they're not gonna build a
 

387
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,670
and and they're not gonna build a
service that's gonna fail based on that

388
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
service that's gonna fail based on that
 

389
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,770
service that's gonna fail based on that
this latency is a big thing sure sure

390
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:40,780
this latency is a big thing sure sure
 

391
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,020
this latency is a big thing sure sure
and because this is internet-based it's

392
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,030
and because this is internet-based it's
 

393
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,060
and because this is internet-based it's
going to be it's going to resolve the

394
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,070
going to be it's going to resolve the
 

395
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,520
going to be it's going to resolve the
cross-platform compatibility issues it's

396
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,530
cross-platform compatibility issues it's
 

397
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,470
cross-platform compatibility issues it's
an interesting thing though because you

398
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,480
an interesting thing though because you
 

399
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,410
an interesting thing though because you
have to remember that this is not game

400
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:52,420
have to remember that this is not game
 

401
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,220
have to remember that this is not game
streaming this is video streaming we've

402
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,230
streaming this is video streaming we've
 

403
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,690
streaming this is video streaming we've
already proven through YouTube and

404
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:57,700
already proven through YouTube and
 

405
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,160
already proven through YouTube and
through everything else that video

406
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,170
through everything else that video
 

407
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,960
through everything else that video
streaming is great these days yep

408
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:00,970
streaming is great these days yep
 

409
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,090
streaming is great these days yep
there's no latency on videos like like

410
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,100
there's no latency on videos like like
 

411
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,070
there's no latency on videos like like
really in real time if it was real time

412
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,080
really in real time if it was real time
 

413
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
really in real time if it was real time
so they've created real time video

414
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,090
so they've created real time video
 

415
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,580
so they've created real time video
streaming service that has the

416
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:08,590
streaming service that has the
 

417
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,640
streaming service that has the
interactivity of controls and control

418
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:11,650
interactivity of controls and control
 

419
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,650
interactivity of controls and control
doesn't take a lot of bandwidth no so

420
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:13,660
doesn't take a lot of bandwidth no so
 

421
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,050
doesn't take a lot of bandwidth no so
it's like it's instant as long as you

422
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,060
it's like it's instant as long as you
 

423
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,010
it's like it's instant as long as you
don't have high pings

424
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,020
don't have high pings
 

425
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,570
don't have high pings
right as long as you don't have latency

426
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:18,580
right as long as you don't have latency
 

427
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,770
right as long as you don't have latency
on your internet connection and that's

428
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:19,780
on your internet connection and that's
 

429
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,340
on your internet connection and that's
the key thing and so they'll be driving

430
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,350
the key thing and so they'll be driving
 

431
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,470
the key thing and so they'll be driving
ISPs to support their codecs and yeah

432
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,480
ISPs to support their codecs and yeah
 

433
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,450
ISPs to support their codecs and yeah
we'll see an evolution in that kind of

434
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:27,460
we'll see an evolution in that kind of
 

435
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,710
we'll see an evolution in that kind of
thing

436
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:31,720

 

437
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,040

very cool if you've tried stadia or any

438
