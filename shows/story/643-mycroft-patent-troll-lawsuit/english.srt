and check out Mycroft I mean it's a

228
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:49,750
and check out Mycroft I mean it's a
 

229
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,740
and check out Mycroft I mean it's a
great project so think about your amazon

230
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:52,750
great project so think about your amazon
 

231
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,020
great project so think about your amazon
echo or Google home Mini or whatever

232
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,030
echo or Google home Mini or whatever
 

233
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,230
echo or Google home Mini or whatever
device you have and then create an

234
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
device you have and then create an
 

235
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,880
device you have and then create an
open-source kind of alternative that you

236
00:04:59,880 --> 00:04:59,890
open-source kind of alternative that you
 

237
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,060
open-source kind of alternative that you
can install on a Raspberry Pi and create

238
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,070
can install on a Raspberry Pi and create
 

239
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,760
can install on a Raspberry Pi and create
your own virtual assistant and create

240
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:05,770
your own virtual assistant and create
 

241
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,340

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,350
plug-ins for it and everything else
 

243
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,360
plug-ins for it and everything else
definitely something we need to look at

244
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,370
definitely something we need to look at
 

245
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:26,730
definitely something we need to look at
category five

246
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:26,740
