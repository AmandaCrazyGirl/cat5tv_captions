86
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,340
take control well they really were yeah
 

87
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,340

work yeah maybe they didn't take control

88
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,350
work yeah maybe they didn't take control
 

89
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,520

91
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,150
and blow something up sure but they had
control mm-hmm so it's kind of like I

92
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
control mm-hmm so it's kind of like I
 

93
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,779
control mm-hmm so it's kind of like I
don't know if I like that statement

that in in this case an email file right
 

105
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,270
that in in this case an email file right
so that email file contained ransomware

dangerous way of thinking because that's
 

297
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,279
dangerous way of thinking because that's
that's how these big industries are
