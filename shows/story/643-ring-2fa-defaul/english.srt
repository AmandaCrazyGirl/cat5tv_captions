not using on a shared device but I think

112
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:24,819
not using on a shared device but I think
 

113
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,640
not using on a shared device but I think
for a lot of people on a home computer

114

for a lot of people on a home computer
 

115
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,330
for a lot of people on a home computer
or maybe like a laptop or something I'm

or maybe like a laptop or something I'm
 

117
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,589
or maybe like a laptop or something I'm
assuming this is also going to be the

on your phone like I think that that

122
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:36,549
on your phone like I think that that
 

123
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,110
on your phone like I think that that
likely 30 days is the mandatory you can

124

likely 30 days is the mandatory you can
 

125
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,179
likely 30 days is the mandatory you can
probably set it to be more frequent I

00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:42,189
probably set it to be more frequent I
 

127
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,830
probably set it to be more frequent I
would hold on I mean I have a lot of

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
would hold on I mean I have a lot of
 

129
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,110
would hold on I mean I have a lot of
two-factor authentication devices and

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120
two-factor authentication devices and
 

131
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,809
two-factor authentication devices and
most of them I just set to every time I

132

most of them I just set to every time I
