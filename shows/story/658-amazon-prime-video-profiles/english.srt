228
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:37,860
with because that's been one of the
 

229
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,370

purpose of being able to get Disney Plus

234
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:44,790

and Amazon Prime TV on our home TV

236
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,110
and Amazon Prime TV on our home TV
 

237
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,450
and Amazon Prime TV on our home TV
because it's not a Smart TV or anything

238
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,460
because it's not a Smart TV or anything
 

239
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,430
because it's not a Smart TV or anything
like that so we needed a way to put all

240
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,440
like that so we needed a way to put all
 

241
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,360
like that so we needed a way to put all
those kind of in there and and and one

242
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,370
those kind of in there and and and one
 

243
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,560
those kind of in there and and and one
of the things that I've struggled with

244
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,570
of the things that I've struggled with
 

245
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,090
of the things that I've struggled with
is whenever we've gone to Amazon to

246
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,100
is whenever we've gone to Amazon to
 

247
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,920
is whenever we've gone to Amazon to
watch their content there is no way to

248
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:03,930
watch their content there is no way to
 

249
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,290
watch their content there is no way to
separate between the kids and the and

250
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,300
separate between the kids and the and
 

251
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,330
separate between the kids and the and
the adults and so this is a nice feature

252
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,340
the adults and so this is a nice feature
 

253
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,250
