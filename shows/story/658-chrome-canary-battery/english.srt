have a couple dozen tabs open and I mean
 

163
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,330
have a couple dozen tabs open and I mean
the with Mike with our family computer

164
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,340
the with Mike with our family computer
 

165
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,819
the with Mike with our family computer
we've got the dual monitors and it's not

166
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:22,829
we've got the dual monitors and it's not
 

167
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,789
we've got the dual monitors and it's not
uncommon for me to have a browser off to

168
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:25,799
uncommon for me to have a browser off to
 

169
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,780
uncommon for me to have a browser off to
the one screen with two dozen tabs and

170
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:29,790
the one screen with two dozen tabs and
 

171
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,569
the one screen with two dozen tabs and
then my main screen where I've got a

172
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:32,579
then my main screen where I've got a
 

173
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,539
then my main screen where I've got a
couple of main tabs and so to have an

174
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:35,549
couple of main tabs and so to have an
 

175
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,520
couple of main tabs and so to have an
ANA grant it's not a laptop but to have

176
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:37,530
ANA grant it's not a laptop but to have
 

177
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,020
ANA grant it's not a laptop but to have
that power saving is huge because not

178
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,030
that power saving is huge because not
 

179
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,750
that power saving is huge because not
only is it less power on the computer

180
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:44,760
only is it less power on the computer
 

181
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,610
only is it less power on the computer
that's being used but over time you

182
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:46,620
that's being used but over time you
 

183
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,530
that's being used but over time you
could see some savings and you're sure

184
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:48,540
could see some savings and you're sure
 

185
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,360
could see some savings and you're sure
you know you mentioned it's not a laptop

186
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,370
you know you mentioned it's not a laptop
 

187
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,250
you know you mentioned it's not a laptop
and and one of the things that Beckett

188
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,260
and and one of the things that Beckett
 

189
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,409
and and one of the things that Beckett
didn't touch on Jeff was performance

190
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:54,419
didn't touch on Jeff was performance
 

191
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,839
didn't touch on Jeff was performance
yeah and I do think about how even on

192
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:56,849
yeah and I do think about how even on
 

193
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,289
yeah and I do think about how even on
our desktop computer at home my youngest

194
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:00,299
our desktop computer at home my youngest
 

195
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,379
our desktop computer at home my youngest
will have that same scenario 20 tabs

196
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:03,389
will have that same scenario 20 tabs
 

197
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,879
will have that same scenario 20 tabs
open and then he'll switch user oh right

198
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:07,889
open and then he'll switch user oh right
 

199
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,780
open and then he'll switch user oh right
so which is great because Linux Mint

200
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:11,790
so which is great because Linux Mint
 

201
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,729
so which is great because Linux Mint
allows us to have multiple people logged

202
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:13,739
allows us to have multiple people logged
 

203
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,979
allows us to have multiple people logged
in at once but now we've got somebody

204
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:15,989
in at once but now we've got somebody
 

205
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,279
in at once but now we've got somebody
else logging in and double tops yeah so

206
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,289
else logging in and double tops yeah so
 

207
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,709
else logging in and double tops yeah so
his Java JavaScript timers are still

208
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:21,719
his Java JavaScript timers are still
 

209
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,690
his Java JavaScript timers are still
going off in his browser on his profile

210
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:24,700
going off in his browser on his profile
 

211
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,450
going off in his browser on his profile
yes so I wonder how it would affect

212
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:27,460
yes so I wonder how it would affect
 

213
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,910
yes so I wonder how it would affect
performance as well yeah I I'm very

214
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:29,920
performance as well yeah I I'm very
 

215
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,220
performance as well yeah I I'm very
interested to see I mean I I know it's a

216
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,230
interested to see I mean I I know it's a
 

217
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,040
interested to see I mean I I know it's a
small change yeah going from one second

218
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,050
small change yeah going from one second
 

219
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,250
small change yeah going from one second
to the one-minute but I'm really looking

220
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,260
to the one-minute but I'm really looking
 

221
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,890
to the one-minute but I'm really looking
forward to see the impact because I do

222
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:40,900
forward to see the impact because I do
 

223
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,910
forward to see the impact because I do
think it's gonna be it will have that

224
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:44,920
think it's gonna be it will have that
 

225
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
think it's gonna be it will have that
you know performance power but and

226
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:46,930
you know performance power but and
 

227
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,800
you know performance power but and
especially for older devices like if you

228
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:49,810
especially for older devices like if you
 

229
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,540
especially for older devices like if you
if you've got an older laptop that's

230
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:51,550
if you've got an older laptop that's
 

231
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,490
if you've got an older laptop that's
always struggling I mean not just

232
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:53,500
always struggling I mean not just
 

233
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,920
always struggling I mean not just
battery saving but if it does improve

234
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,930
battery saving but if it does improve
 

235
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,440
battery saving but if it does improve
some of that background performance you

236
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,450
some of that background performance you
 

237
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,880
some of that background performance you
know that could breathe you know a

238
00:04:59,880 --> 00:04:59,890
know that could breathe you know a
 

239
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,230
know that could breathe you know a
little bit of extra life into those

240
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,240
little bit of extra life into those
 

241
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,390
little bit of extra life into those
devices besides I think it's a great

242
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:03,400
devices besides I think it's a great
 

243
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:18,630
devices besides I think it's a great
great idea a great feature yeah

244
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:18,640

 

245
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,680
