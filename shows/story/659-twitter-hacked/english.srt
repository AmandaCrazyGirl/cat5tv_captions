or is this a security breach on the
devices that

322
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
devices that
 

323

run those twitter accounts because the
 

325
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,230
run those twitter accounts because the
fact that they were all

326
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
fact that they were all
 

327
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,309
fact that they were all
fairly simultaneous within minutes of

fairly simultaneous within minutes of
 

329
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,990
fairly simultaneous within minutes of
one another

330

one another
 

331
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,670
one another
makes me wonder was it an

332
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680

is very specific in his phrasing when he

580
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
is very specific in his phrasing when he
 

581
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,509
is very specific in his phrasing when he
says don't use your phone number

582
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
says don't use your phone number
 

583
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,750
says don't use your phone number
right as the 2fa right and that

584
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
right as the 2fa right and that
 

585
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,069
right as the 2fa right and that
absolutely makes sense

586
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
absolutely makes sense
 

587
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,310
absolutely makes sense
absolutely google authenticator on the

588
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
absolutely google authenticator on the
 

589
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,069
absolutely google authenticator on the
other hand and i say that because

590
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
other hand and i say that because
 

591
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,870
other hand and i say that because
that's a very common one there are other

592
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
that's a very common one there are other
 

593
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,150
that's a very common one there are other
authenticator apps

594
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
authenticator apps
 

595
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,430
authenticator apps
or single use password one-time password

596
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
or single use password one-time password
 

597
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,630
or single use password one-time password
otp apps available but

598
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
otp apps available but
 

599
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,910
otp apps available but
they generate a password and they

600
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
they generate a password and they
 

601
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,750
they generate a password and they
refresh every 15 seconds or something

602
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
refresh every 15 seconds or something
 

603
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,230
refresh every 15 seconds or something
like that

604
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
like that
 

605
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,030
like that
so it it makes sure that that one-time

606
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
so it it makes sure that that one-time
 

607
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,949
so it it makes sure that that one-time
password is only available for 15

608
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
password is only available for 15
 

609
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,550
password is only available for 15
seconds yeah so if you don't have your

610
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
seconds yeah so if you don't have your
 

611
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,750
seconds yeah so if you don't have your
phone you're not getting in

612
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
phone you're not getting in
 

613
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,269
phone you're not getting in
yeah and you really do need multi-factor

614
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
yeah and you really do need multi-factor
 

615
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,150
yeah and you really do need multi-factor
authentication on

616
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
authentication on
 

617
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,710

perfect solution it's not you don't be

624
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
perfect solution it's not you don't be
 

625
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,350
perfect solution it's not you don't be

complacent
 

627
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,629
complacent
but realize that if you don't have 2fa

628
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
but realize that if you don't have 2fa
 

629
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,829
but realize that if you don't have 2fa
you are in a very risky situation

630
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
you are in a very risky situation
 

631
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,190
you are in a very risky situation
these days i was a part of a

the other day about encryption 2fa those

638
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
the other day about encryption 2fa those
 

639
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,069
the other day about encryption 2fa those
kinds of things and one of my comments

640
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
kinds of things and one of my comments
 

641
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:14,550
kinds of things and one of my comments
was

642
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
was
 

643
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,790
was
like if you had a device that had a

644
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
like if you had a device that had a
 

645
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,470
like if you had a device that had a
bunch of data on it you left it on your

646
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
bunch of data on it you left it on your
 

647
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,110
bunch of data on it you left it on your
car seat and someone stole it

648
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
car seat and someone stole it
 

649
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,949
car seat and someone stole it
would one would you lose any of the data

650
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
would one would you lose any of the data
 

651
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,590
would one would you lose any of the data
and two would they gain access to that

652
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
and two would they gain access to that
 

653
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,310
and two would they gain access to that
data

654
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
data
 

655
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,750
data
and the answer to both of those

656
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
and the answer to both of those
 

657
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,910
and the answer to both of those
questions should be no correct

658
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
questions should be no correct
 

659
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,350
questions should be no correct
and that encryption should be

660
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
and that encryption should be
 

661
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,750
and that encryption should be
authentication enabled you should have

662
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
authentication enabled you should have
 

663
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,470
authentication enabled you should have
2fa

664
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
2fa
 

665
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,310
2fa
