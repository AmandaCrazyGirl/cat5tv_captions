it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such

304
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such
 

305
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,790
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such
an easy hack so it's like

306
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
an easy hack so it's like
 

307
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,670
an easy hack so it's like
how can they trust that data well i

308
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
how can they trust that data well i
 

309
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,469
how can they trust that data well i
think it's brilliant
