server it's really easy because you can

226
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
server it's really easy because you can
 

227
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,789
server it's really easy because you can
do a find

228
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
do a find
 

229
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,070
do a find
dash m time and and sort by the time

230
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
dash m time and and sort by the time
 

231
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,789
dash m time and and sort by the time
uh that the file was last modified okay

232
