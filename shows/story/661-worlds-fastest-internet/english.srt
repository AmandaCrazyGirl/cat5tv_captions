it's interesting i mean there's two
things that kind of jumped out at me

170
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
things that kind of jumped out at me
 

171
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,710
things that kind of jumped out at me
about this story the first one

172
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
about this story the first one
 

173
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,110
about this story the first one
uh what becca was kind of getting to

174
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
uh what becca was kind of getting to
 

175
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,309
uh what becca was kind of getting to
about um

176
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
about um
 

177
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,830
about um
24 000 i think for 50 kilometers

178
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
24 000 i think for 50 kilometers
 

179
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,190
24 000 i think for 50 kilometers
or per kilometer whatever it was um to

180
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
or per kilometer whatever it was um to
 

181
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,509
or per kilometer whatever it was um to
to do the math was there yeah it was

182
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
to do the math was there yeah it was
 

183
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,110
to do the math was there yeah it was
there we've butchered it so far

184
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
there we've butchered it so far
 

185
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,949
there we've butchered it so far
but that's right but significantly

186
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
but that's right but significantly
 

187
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,270
but that's right but significantly
cheaper significantly make this upgrade

188
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
cheaper significantly make this upgrade
 

189
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,350
cheaper significantly make this upgrade
than to lay new fiber well yeah and so

190
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
than to lay new fiber well yeah and so
 

191
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,630
than to lay new fiber well yeah and so
interestingly enough

192
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
interestingly enough
 

193
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,270
interestingly enough

building we had
really slow internet like half meg

210
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
really slow internet like half meg

we looked into fiverr then we looked
 

221
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,350
we looked into fiverr then we looked
into dsl then we looked into

into dsl then we looked into
cable the one kilometer actually i think

224
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
cable the one kilometer actually i think
 

225
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,990
cable the one kilometer actually i think
it's 0.8 kilometers from

226
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
it's 0.8 kilometers from
 

227
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,509
it's 0.8 kilometers from
the junction box at the corner to where

228
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
the junction box at the corner to where
 

229
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,789
the junction box at the corner to where
our property line was and every quote we

230
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
our property line was and every quote we
 

231
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,830
our property line was and every quote we
got was

232
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
got was
 

233
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,750
got was
six figures or more yeah and i'm like

234
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
six figures or more yeah and i'm like
 

235
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,070
six figures or more yeah and i'm like
we're talking a kilometer

236
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
we're talking a kilometer
 

237
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,270
we're talking a kilometer
and then i'm hearing this and i'm like

238
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
and then i'm hearing this and i'm like
 

239
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,110
and then i'm hearing this and i'm like
this is amazing but at the same time the

240
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
this is amazing but at the same time the
 

241
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,390
this is amazing but at the same time the
fact that it's utilizing

242
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
fact that it's utilizing
 

243
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,390
fact that it's utilizing
light and i mean here we are in a studio

244
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
light and i mean here we are in a studio
 

245
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,630
light and i mean here we are in a studio
with light bulbs all around us now

246
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
with light bulbs all around us now
 

247
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,990
with light bulbs all around us now
they're all led

248
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
they're all led
 

249
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,070
they're all led
so that's not quite the same thing but

250
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
so that's not quite the same thing but
 

251
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,830
so that's not quite the same thing but
how neat would it be

252
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
how neat would it be
 

253
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,189
how neat would it be
if this technology could be advanced to

254
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
if this technology could be advanced to
 

255
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,310
if this technology could be advanced to
the point where we're getting our

256
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
the point where we're getting our
 

257
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,469
the point where we're getting our
internet off a light bulb

258
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
internet off a light bulb
 

259
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,510
internet off a light bulb
if it's if it's through like how neat

260
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
if it's if it's through like how neat
 

261
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,310
if it's if it's through like how neat
would that be

262
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
would that be
 

263
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,390
would that be
like it's gotta be a little more refined

264
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
like it's gotta be a little more refined
 

265
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,350
like it's gotta be a little more refined
than that i mean

266
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
than that i mean
 

267
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,230
than that i mean
fiber optics are i i agree but you look

268
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
fiber optics are i i agree but you look
 

269
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,469
fiber optics are i i agree but you look
at where the internet was 25 years ago

270
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
at where the internet was 25 years ago
 

271
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,790
at where the internet was 25 years ago
yeah like imagine 15 years from now you

272
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
yeah like imagine 15 years from now you
 

273
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,110
yeah like imagine 15 years from now you
flick on a light and boom

274
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
flick on a light and boom
 

275
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,070
flick on a light and boom
like oh jeff your predicament that you

276
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
like oh jeff your predicament that you
 

277
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,230
like oh jeff your predicament that you
have at your church or that you had

278
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
have at your church or that you had
 

279
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,909
have at your church or that you had
presumably you've found a solution at

280
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
presumably you've found a solution at
 

281
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,150
presumably you've found a solution at
least to get your body

282
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
least to get your body
 

283
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,070

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
oh okay so you're wireless so you're
 

285
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,430
oh okay so you're wireless so you're
getting about 20 megs

286
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
getting about 20 megs
 

287
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,110
getting about 20 megs
per second uh 20 up 45 down yeah okay

288
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
per second uh 20 up 45 down yeah okay
 

289
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,710
per second uh 20 up 45 down yeah okay
yeah so that's not bad that's pretty

290
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
yeah so that's not bad that's pretty
 

291
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,030
yeah so that's not bad that's pretty
good

292
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
good
 

293
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,189
good
no we could stream that's good expensive

294
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
no we could stream that's good expensive
 

295
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,710
no we could stream that's good expensive
wouldn't it be cheaper

296
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
wouldn't it be cheaper
 

297
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,590
wouldn't it be cheaper
this is just a crazy thought but buy the

298
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
this is just a crazy thought but buy the
 

299
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,950
this is just a crazy thought but buy the
property on the corner that's near the

300
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
property on the corner that's near the
 

301
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,430
property on the corner that's near the
junction box

302
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
junction box
 

303
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,550
junction box
buy the property and have them run

304
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
buy the property and have them run
 

305
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,670
buy the property and have them run
a six foot length from the junction box

306
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
a six foot length from the junction box
 

307
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,830
a six foot length from the junction box
to a little tiny tower and put a

308
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
to a little tiny tower and put a
 

309
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,830
to a little tiny tower and put a
ubiquity antenna on that

310
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
ubiquity antenna on that
 

311
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,110
ubiquity antenna on that
that is pointed at your church that has

312
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
that is pointed at your church that has
 

313
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,350
that is pointed at your church that has
like air fiber you know which is like

314
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
like air fiber you know which is like
 

315
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,029
like air fiber you know which is like
gigabit a second you know it's funny we

316
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
gigabit a second you know it's funny we
 

317
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,710
gigabit a second you know it's funny we
have we actually have

318
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
have we actually have
 

319
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,189
have we actually have
our sign there that we rent from the

320
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
our sign there that we rent from the
 

321
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,629
our sign there that we rent from the
person who owns the property

322
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
person who owns the property
 

323
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,350
person who owns the property
so put a little ubiquity antenna on top

324
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
so put a little ubiquity antenna on top
 

325
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,110
so put a little ubiquity antenna on top
of your sign

326
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
of your sign
 

327
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,189
of your sign
connect it to the fiber and you'd have

328
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
connect it to the fiber and you'd have
 

329
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,629
connect it to the fiber and you'd have
