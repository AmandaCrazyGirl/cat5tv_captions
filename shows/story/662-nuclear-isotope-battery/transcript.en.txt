sick of your smartphone dying at 3 pm a
u.s
startup may have the answer as they've
unveiled a battery made from nuclear
waste
that could last up to 28 000 years
the power for the nanodiamond battery
comes from radioactive isotopes used in
nuclear reactors
its radioactive core is protected by
multiple layers of synthetic diamonds
one of the hardest materials to damage
or break
the energy is absorbed in the diamond
and used to generate electricity
the battery can be used to power devices
and machines of any size
from aircraft and rockets to electric
vehicles
and smartphones nima gol sharifi
ceo and co-founder of ndb said
as members of society we are extremely
concerned about the welfare of the
planet and are focused on lowering
climate change to protect our planet
for future generations he goes on to say
with the ndb battery we have achieved a
massive
groundbreaking proprietary technological
breakthrough of a battery
that is emission-free lasts thousands of
years and only requires access to
natural
air in order to power devices the
company says the development of the
first commercial prototype battery is
currently underway
and will be available later this year
