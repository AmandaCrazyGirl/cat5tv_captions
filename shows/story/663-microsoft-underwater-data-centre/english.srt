you also get temperature fluctuations so

174
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
you also get temperature fluctuations so
 

175
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,270
you also get temperature fluctuations so
the heat from night to day and summer to

the heat from night to day and summer to
 

177
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,949
the heat from night to day and summer to
winter can cause those components to

178
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
winter can cause those components to
 

179
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,470
winter can cause those components to
fail and so we have this theory that if

180
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
fail and so we have this theory that if
 

181
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,229
fail and so we have this theory that if
we're in a really stable environment
