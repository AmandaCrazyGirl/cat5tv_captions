kids are now getting into
apps and games they see these ads

214
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
apps and games they see these ads
 

215
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,630
apps and games they see these ads
and they're like oh dad i want to

216
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
and they're like oh dad i want to
 

217
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,630
