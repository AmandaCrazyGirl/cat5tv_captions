00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
systems
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.070 align:start position:0%
systems
and<00:03:09.519><c> that</c><00:03:09.840><c> is</c><00:03:10.000><c> a</c><00:03:10.159><c> tragedy</c><00:03:11.599><c> if</c><00:03:11.760><c> you</c><00:03:11.840><c> have</c><00:03:12.000><c> a</c>

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
and that is a tragedy if you have a
 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.149 align:start position:0%
and that is a tragedy if you have a
windows<00:03:12.480><c> 7</c><00:03:12.720><c> or</c><00:03:12.800><c> windows</c><00:03:13.200><c> xp</c><00:03:13.599><c> system</c><00:03:13.920><c> on</c><00:03:14.000><c> your</c>

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
network just
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.390 align:start position:0%
network just
turn<00:03:16.000><c> it</c><00:03:16.159><c> off</c><00:03:16.480><c> get</c><00:03:16.640><c> rid</c><00:03:16.879><c> of</c><00:03:17.040><c> it</c><00:03:17.599><c> yeah</c><00:03:17.920><c> see</c><00:03:18.080><c> the</c>

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.470 align:start position:0%
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the
the<00:03:18.560><c> thing</c><00:03:18.800><c> is</c><00:03:18.959><c> is</c><00:03:19.200><c> with</c><00:03:19.440><c> those</c><00:03:19.760><c> systems</c><00:03:20.239><c> so</c>

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
the thing is is with those systems so
 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.910 align:start position:0%
the thing is is with those systems so
microsoft<00:03:21.120><c> has</c>

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
microsoft has
 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.589 align:start position:0%
microsoft has

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.670 align:start position:0%
what we call eol or end of life uh
has<00:03:26.080><c> has</c><00:03:26.400><c> ended</c><00:03:26.879><c> the</c><00:03:27.040><c> life</c><00:03:27.280><c> of</c><00:03:27.360><c> these</c>

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 align:start position:0%

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.430 align:start position:0%
has has ended the life of these

operating systems
 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.350 align:start position:0%

so<00:03:29.599><c> they've</c><00:03:29.920><c> said</c><00:03:30.560><c> you've</c><00:03:30.720><c> got</c><00:03:30.799><c> to</c><00:03:30.959><c> upgrade</c><00:03:31.200><c> to</c>

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
so they've said you've got to upgrade to
 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.030 align:start position:0%
so they've said you've got to upgrade to
windows<00:03:31.680><c> 10</c><00:03:32.000><c> well</c><00:03:32.159><c> i</c><00:03:32.239><c> don't</c><00:03:32.400><c> want</c><00:03:32.560><c> to</c><00:03:32.720><c> upgrade</c>

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
windows 10 well i don't want to upgrade
 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.869 align:start position:0%
windows 10 well i don't want to upgrade
to<00:03:33.120><c> windows</c><00:03:33.440><c> 10</c><00:03:33.599><c> i</c><00:03:33.760><c> like</c><00:03:33.920><c> my</c><00:03:34.080><c> windows</c><00:03:34.319><c> 7.</c>

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.110 align:start position:0%
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
i<00:03:35.040><c> understand</c><00:03:35.680><c> that</c><00:03:35.920><c> and</c><00:03:36.159><c> i</c><00:03:36.319><c> respect</c><00:03:36.799><c> that</c>

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
i understand that and i respect that
 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.550 align:start position:0%
i understand that and i respect that
however

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
however
 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.309 align:start position:0%

here's<00:03:38.879><c> the</c><00:03:39.120><c> problem</c><00:03:40.640><c> hackers</c>

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
here's the problem hackers
 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.190 align:start position:0%
here's the problem hackers
now<00:03:43.120><c> are</c><00:03:43.360><c> able</c><00:03:43.599><c> to</c><00:03:43.920><c> exploit</c><00:03:44.480><c> these</c><00:03:44.720><c> operating</c>

now are able to exploit these operating
 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.789 align:start position:0%
now are able to exploit these operating

either give away or sell those exploits
 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.710 align:start position:0%

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so now these hackers
 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.670 align:start position:0%
and so now these hackers
if<00:04:12.239><c> you</c><00:04:12.400><c> will</c><00:04:12.640><c> we're</c><00:04:12.799><c> gonna</c><00:04:12.959><c> call</c><00:04:13.200><c> them</c><00:04:13.439><c> that</c>

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you will we're gonna call them that
 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.190 align:start position:0%
if you will we're gonna call them that
but<00:04:14.000><c> realistically</c>

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
but realistically
 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start position:0%
but realistically
in<00:04:15.360><c> a</c><00:04:15.439><c> lot</c><00:04:15.599><c> of</c><00:04:15.680><c> cases</c><00:04:16.000><c> they're</c><00:04:16.160><c> what</c><00:04:16.400><c> we</c><00:04:16.479><c> call</c>

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases they're what we call
 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases they're what we call
script<00:04:17.280><c> kitties</c>

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
script kitties
 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.909 align:start position:0%
