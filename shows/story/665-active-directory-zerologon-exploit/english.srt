00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
in the back room nobody really uses it
 

173
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,030
in the back room nobody really uses it
or oh well we need this one to still

174
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
or oh well we need this one to still
 

175
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,550
or oh well we need this one to still
have windows xp because

176
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
have windows xp because
 

177
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,990
have windows xp because
we have problems with one of our

178
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
we have problems with one of our
 

179
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,670
we have problems with one of our
printers if we don't

180
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
printers if we don't
 

181
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,070
printers if we don't
uh we're still seeing a lot of windows 7

182
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
uh we're still seeing a lot of windows 7
 

183
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,030
uh we're still seeing a lot of windows 7
systems

184
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
systems
 

185
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,070
systems
and that is a tragedy if you have a

186
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
and that is a tragedy if you have a
 

187
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,149
and that is a tragedy if you have a
windows 7 or windows xp system on your

188
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
windows 7 or windows xp system on your
 

189
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,830
windows 7 or windows xp system on your
network just

190
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
network just
 

191
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,390
network just
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the

192
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the
 

193
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,470
turn it off get rid of it yeah see the
the thing is is with those systems so

194
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
the thing is is with those systems so
 

195
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,910
the thing is is with those systems so
microsoft has

196
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
microsoft has
 

197
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,589
microsoft has
what we call eol or end of life uh

198
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
what we call eol or end of life uh
 

199
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,670
what we call eol or end of life uh
has has ended the life of these

200
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
has has ended the life of these
 

201
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,430
has has ended the life of these
operating systems

202
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
operating systems
 

203
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,350
operating systems
so they've said you've got to upgrade to

204
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
so they've said you've got to upgrade to
 

205
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,030
so they've said you've got to upgrade to
windows 10 well i don't want to upgrade

206
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
windows 10 well i don't want to upgrade
 

207
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,869
windows 10 well i don't want to upgrade
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.

208
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
 

209
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,110
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
i understand that and i respect that

210
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
i understand that and i respect that
 

211
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,550
i understand that and i respect that
however

212
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
however
 

213
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,309
however
here's the problem hackers

214
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
here's the problem hackers
 

215
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,190
here's the problem hackers
now are able to exploit these operating

216
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
now are able to exploit these operating
 

217
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,789
now are able to exploit these operating
systems

218
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
systems
 

219
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,670
systems
and as they do that as they find

220
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
and as they do that as they find
 

221
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,949
and as they do that as they find
exploits

222
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
exploits
 

223
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,630
exploits
there's a couple of things that happen

224
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
there's a couple of things that happen
 

225
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,149
there's a couple of things that happen
one they

226
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
one they
 

227
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,589
one they
either give away or sell those exploits

228
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
either give away or sell those exploits
 

229
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,710
either give away or sell those exploits
or two they're just they're released

230
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
or two they're just they're released
 

231
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,070
or two they're just they're released
to the public through whether it's

232
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
to the public through whether it's
 

233
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,910
to the public through whether it's
through the dark web or even on github

234
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
through the dark web or even on github
 

235
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,949
through the dark web or even on github
yep as as security research

236
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
yep as as security research
 

237
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,070
yep as as security research
and so now these hackers

238
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
and so now these hackers
 

239
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,670
and so now these hackers
if you will we're gonna call them that

240
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
if you will we're gonna call them that
 

241
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,190
if you will we're gonna call them that
but realistically

242
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
but realistically
 

243
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,789
but realistically
in a lot of cases they're what we call

244
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
in a lot of cases they're what we call
 

245
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,550
in a lot of cases they're what we call
script kitties

246
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
script kitties
 

247
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,909
script kitties
and these are um

248
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
and these are um
 

249
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,950
and these are um
not even like hackers yes but they don't

250
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
not even like hackers yes but they don't
 

251
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,790
not even like hackers yes but they don't
have to have a lot of knowledge because

252
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
have to have a lot of knowledge because
 

253
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,670
have to have a lot of knowledge because
the

254
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
the
 

255
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,950
the
the exploit is publicly that's right

256
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
the exploit is publicly that's right
 

257
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,830
the exploit is publicly that's right
known and understood so if there are

258
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
known and understood so if there are
 

259
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,590
known and understood so if there are
exploits that are available for an

260
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
exploits that are available for an
 

261
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,430
exploits that are available for an
operating system

262
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
operating system
 

263
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,749
operating system
what do we expect to happen we expect

264
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
what do we expect to happen we expect
 

265
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,070
what do we expect to happen we expect
the operating system vendor microsoft in

266
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
the operating system vendor microsoft in
 

267
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,030
the operating system vendor microsoft in
this case

268
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
this case
 

269
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,390
this case
to patch that exploit to fix it

270
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
to patch that exploit to fix it
 

271
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,030
to patch that exploit to fix it
and that's the case with windows 10.

272
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
and that's the case with windows 10.
 

273
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,749
and that's the case with windows 10.
sadly though

274
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
sadly though
 

275
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,150
sadly though
those that are eol it's not the case

276
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
those that are eol it's not the case
 

277
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,230
those that are eol it's not the case
with an eol operating system sometimes

278
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
with an eol operating system sometimes
 

279
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,350
with an eol operating system sometimes
we hear oh well i don't need support

280
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
we hear oh well i don't need support
 

281
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,189
we hear oh well i don't need support
well microsoft has ended support that's

282
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
well microsoft has ended support that's
 

283
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,029
well microsoft has ended support that's
what we've heard yeah they've ended

284
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
what we've heard yeah they've ended
 

285
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,629
what we've heard yeah they've ended
support for windows 7. they've ended

286
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
support for windows 7. they've ended
 

287
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,629
support for windows 7. they've ended
support for windows xp

288
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
support for windows xp
 

289
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,029
support for windows xp
oh but i i've never had to call support

290
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
oh but i i've never had to call support
 

291
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,830
oh but i i've never had to call support
i can

292
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
i can
 

293
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,749
i can
handle it that's not what they're

294
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
handle it that's not what they're
 

295
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,350
handle it that's not what they're
talking about at all what they're saying

296
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
talking about at all what they're saying
 

297
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,150
talking about at all what they're saying
is they

298
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
is they
 

299
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,990
is they
will not fix the patches it does

300
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
will not fix the patches it does
 

301
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,990
will not fix the patches it does
the the exploits doesn't matter how

302
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
the the exploits doesn't matter how
 

303
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,749
the the exploits doesn't matter how
severe they are

304
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
severe they are
 

305
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,350
severe they are
it doesn't matter how easy they are to

306
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
it doesn't matter how easy they are to
 

307
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,150
it doesn't matter how easy they are to
exploit so you have a windows 7 machine

308
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
exploit so you have a windows 7 machine
 

309
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,270
exploit so you have a windows 7 machine
on your network well

310
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
on your network well
 

311
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,790
on your network well
you are giving entry to

312
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
you are giving entry to
 

313
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,510
you are giving entry to
one of these hackers who don't even have

314
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
one of these hackers who don't even have
 

315
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,070
one of these hackers who don't even have
to be very good at hacking because

316
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
to be very good at hacking because
 

317
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,749
to be very good at hacking because
the exploits are publicly known yep

318
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
the exploits are publicly known yep
 

319
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,430
the exploits are publicly known yep
sometimes they're part of tools

320
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
sometimes they're part of tools
 

321
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,350
sometimes they're part of tools
sometimes they can just download a free

322
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
sometimes they can just download a free
 

323
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,270
sometimes they can just download a free
tool and they can say i want to

324
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
tool and they can say i want to
 

325
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,550
tool and they can say i want to
with one check exploit windows 7

326
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
with one check exploit windows 7
 

327
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,510
with one check exploit windows 7
and so they get into a windows 7 box or

328
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
and so they get into a windows 7 box or
 

329
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,590
and so they get into a windows 7 box or
they've tricked one of your employees

330
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
they've tricked one of your employees
 

331
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,110
they've tricked one of your employees
even if they're just somebody in the

332
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
even if they're just somebody in the
 

333
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,070
even if they're just somebody in the
back working in the warehouse
