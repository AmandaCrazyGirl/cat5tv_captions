basically makes a super computer
right out of several computers so you

158
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
right out of several computers so you
 

159
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,070
right out of several computers so you
think about these raspberry pi

160
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
think about these raspberry pi
 

161

thought was
could i automate like some of the

202
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
could i automate like some of the
 

203
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,350
could i automate like some of the

210
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
compute module four
 

211
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,030
compute module four
yeah takes more than that but i know it

212
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
yeah takes more than that but i know it
 

213
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,270
yeah takes more than that but i know it
could be the brains of such an operation

214
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
