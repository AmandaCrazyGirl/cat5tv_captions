i think about as you just did if i could

126
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
i think about as you just did if i could
 

127
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,190
i think about as you just did if i could
set it down on a table

128
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
set it down on a table
 

129
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,550
set it down on a table
what if you could set it down on a

130
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
what if you could set it down on a
 

131
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,710
what if you could set it down on a
restaurant table yes because a lot of

132
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
restaurant table yes because a lot of
 

133
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,670
restaurant table yes because a lot of
restaurants have

134
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
restaurants have
 

135
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,510
restaurants have
gone the route and i'm using restaurants

136
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
gone the route and i'm using restaurants
 

137
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,949
gone the route and i'm using restaurants
as the example but a lot of places have

138
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
as the example but a lot of places have
 

139
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,910
as the example but a lot of places have
gone the route of

140
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
gone the route of
 

141
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,630
gone the route of
embedding usb yes so that you can plug

142
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
embedding usb yes so that you can plug
 

143
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,589
embedding usb yes so that you can plug
in your usb

144
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
in your usb
 

145
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,390
in your usb
cable to charge your phone but then all

146
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
cable to charge your phone but then all
 

147
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,830
cable to charge your phone but then all
of a sudden people got

148
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
of a sudden people got
 

149
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,949
of a sudden people got
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports

150
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports
 

151
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,390
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports
could be malicious

152
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
could be malicious
 

153
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,110
could be malicious
because usb also carries data or that's

154
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
because usb also carries data or that's
 

155
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,550
because usb also carries data or that's
right who knows if it's

156
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
right who knows if it's
 

157
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,630
right who knows if it's
too many volts and that you know maybe

158
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
too many volts and that you know maybe
 

159
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,790
too many volts and that you know maybe
it's got a short or something like that

160
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
it's got a short or something like that
 

161
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,390
it's got a short or something like that
and could fry my phone

162
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
and could fry my phone
 

163
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,070
and could fry my phone
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to

164
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to
 

165
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,390
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to
plug into the usb port because hey it

166
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
plug into the usb port because hey it
 

167
