166
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
obtain the resources but when those are
 

167
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,350
obtain the resources but when those are
depleted

168
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
depleted
 

169
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,790
depleted
when they're no longer able to hold

170
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
when they're no longer able to hold
 

171
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,869
when they're no longer able to hold
exactly the waste everything else

172
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
exactly the waste everything else
 

173
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,430
exactly the waste everything else
yeah yeah that's exactly right one less

174
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
yeah yeah that's exactly right one less
 

175
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,790
yeah yeah that's exactly right one less
thing to worry about and

176
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
thing to worry about and
 

177
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,030
thing to worry about and
it's just amazing these technologies and

178
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
it's just amazing these technologies and
 

179
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,070
it's just amazing these technologies and
i'm curious

180
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
i'm curious
 

181
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,030
i'm curious
to see what they think of next i love

182
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
to see what they think of next i love
 

183
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,229
to see what they think of next i love
the idea of

184
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
the idea of
 

185
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,070
the idea of
an energy source that is able to kind of

186
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
an energy source that is able to kind of
 

187
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,430
an energy source that is able to kind of
recycle itself

188
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
recycle itself
 

189
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,190
recycle itself
yes and that's kind of what this reminds

190
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
yes and that's kind of what this reminds
 

191
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,949
yes and that's kind of what this reminds
me of i've thought about and i know it's

192
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
me of i've thought about and i know it's
 

193
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,309
me of i've thought about and i know it's
not practical and i know that it's

194
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
not practical and i know that it's
 

195
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,070
not practical and i know that it's
probably not even possible but

196
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
probably not even possible but
 

197
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,869
probably not even possible but
um putting like uh you know you know in

198
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
um putting like uh you know you know in
 

199
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,710
um putting like uh you know you know in
a water source something that can pump

200
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
a water source something that can pump
 

201
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,070
a water source something that can pump
the water because

202
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
the water because
 

203
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,910
the water because
and generate electricity at the same

204
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
and generate electricity at the same
 

205
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,509
and generate electricity at the same
time there's so many neat ideas out

206
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
time there's so many neat ideas out
 

207
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,390
time there's so many neat ideas out
there

208
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
there
 

209
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,750
there
this is something that's actually coming

210
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
this is something that's actually coming
 

211
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,589
this is something that's actually coming
to pass well that this is the number one

212
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
to pass well that this is the number one
 

213
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,710
to pass well that this is the number one
thing because

214
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
thing because
 

215
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,270
thing because
with in respect to green technology the

216
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
with in respect to green technology the
 

217
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,789
with in respect to green technology the
big the largest thing that's been

218
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
big the largest thing that's been
 

219
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,830
big the largest thing that's been
lagging behind

220
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
lagging behind
 

221
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,270
lagging behind
is definitely being able to store that

222
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
is definitely being able to store that
 

223
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,710
is definitely being able to store that
energy because again we do have these

224
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
energy because again we do have these
 

225
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,949
energy because again we do have these
advances in solar power wind power

226
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
advances in solar power wind power
 

227
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,550
advances in solar power wind power
but the issue is where do you store all

228
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
but the issue is where do you store all
 

229
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,070
but the issue is where do you store all
that where do you put it yeah so this

230
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
that where do you put it yeah so this
 

231
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,750
that where do you put it yeah so this
can definitely be one of those solutions

232
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
can definitely be one of those solutions
 

233
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,270
can definitely be one of those solutions
that can help us

234
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
that can help us
 

235
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,509
that can help us
help turn our economy our world into a

236
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
help turn our economy our world into a
 

237
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,630
help turn our economy our world into a
more greener place

238
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
more greener place
 

239
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,390
more greener place
cool down the road so this this is

240
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
cool down the road so this this is
 

241
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,750
cool down the road so this this is
really really cool here can't wait to

242
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
really really cool here can't wait to
 

243
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,789
really really cool here can't wait to
see what comes of it

244
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
see what comes of it
 

245
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,390
see what comes of it
yeah or here's a bit or smells of it

246
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
yeah or here's a bit or smells of it
 

247
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,149
yeah or here's a bit or smells of it
i'm trying to think of air puns but it's

i'm trying to think of air puns but it's
 

249
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,630
i'm trying to think of air puns but it's
not working so

250
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
not working so
 

251
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,830
