it's a it's a like a if i throw enough

218
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
it's a it's a like a if i throw enough
 

219
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,430
it's a it's a like a if i throw enough

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,429
somebody else might and and social
engineering they

244
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
engineering they
 

245
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,229
engineering they
they trick those folks into installing

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
they trick those folks into installing
 

247
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,509
they trick those folks into installing
this malware and we're talking

248
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
this malware and we're talking
 

249
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,629
this malware and we're talking
ransomware

250
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
ransomware
 

251
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,430
ransomware
so ransomware is the one that encrypts

252
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
so ransomware is the one that encrypts
 

253
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,069
so ransomware is the one that encrypts
your

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,430
you're connected to
and encrypts all the files that it can

260
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
and encrypts all the files that it can
 

261
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,749
and encrypts all the files that it can
gain access to and as we know

262
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
gain access to and as we know
 

263
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,790
gain access to and as we know
from xero logon that is every

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
from xero logon that is every
 

265
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,510
from xero logon that is every

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,830
file on the entire network if you're
like

268
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
like
 

269
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,110
like
like a school network you think oh well

270
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
like a school network you think oh well
 

271
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,070
like a school network you think oh well
we're locked down it's safe

272
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
we're locked down it's safe
 

273
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,189
we're locked down it's safe
no zero login zero logon allows

274
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
no zero login zero logon allows
 

275
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,870
no zero login zero logon allows
them to have administrator credentials

276
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
them to have administrator credentials
 

277
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,110
them to have administrator credentials
just like just like your i.t admin

278
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
just like just like your i.t admin
 

279
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,230
just like just like your i.t admin
so like these are serious exploits

280
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
so like these are serious exploits
 

281
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,830
so like these are serious exploits
and social engineering they're using

282
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
and social engineering they're using
 

283
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,990
and social engineering they're using
that to get into these systems that

284
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
that to get into these systems that
 

285
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,749
that to get into these systems that
could be a back door into the network

286
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
could be a back door into the network
 

287
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,710
could be a back door into the network
well exactly

288
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
well exactly
 

289
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,550
well exactly
i'm also scared for small businesses

290
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
i'm also scared for small businesses
 

291
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,469
i'm also scared for small businesses
right yeah so again

292
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
right yeah so again
 

293
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,150
right yeah so again
everyone's working from home now so

294
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
everyone's working from home now so
 

295
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,390
everyone's working from home now so
again if you have employees who aren't

296
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
again if you have employees who aren't
 

297
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,909
again if you have employees who aren't
aztec literate or

298
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
aztec literate or
 

299
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,029
aztec literate or
but henry who would target me

300
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
but henry who would target me
 

301
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,670
but henry who would target me
i'm just uh i'm just a work from home

302
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
i'm just uh i'm just a work from home
 

303
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,710
i'm just uh i'm just a work from home
you know person who

304
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
you know person who
 

305
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,870
you know person who
no nobody would always target me see

306
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
no nobody would always target me see
 

307
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,469
no nobody would always target me see
yeah false insecure

308
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
yeah false insecure
 

309
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,870
yeah false insecure
security right yeah we become complacent

310
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
security right yeah we become complacent
 

311
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,590
security right yeah we become complacent
absolutely

312
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
absolutely
 

313
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,469
absolutely
the fact is is that these are

314
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:21,479
the fact is is that these are
 

315
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,590
the fact is is that these are
non-targeted attacks

316
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
non-targeted attacks
 

317
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,270
non-targeted attacks
these tools are built to find

318
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
these tools are built to find
 

319
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,990
these tools are built to find
susceptible systems and attack them yeah

320
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
susceptible systems and attack them yeah
 

321
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,590
susceptible systems and attack them yeah
just a wide net that's all it takes

322
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
just a wide net that's all it takes
 

323
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,469
just a wide net that's all it takes
like you said one email spam it out yeah

324
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
like you said one email spam it out yeah
 

325
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,189
like you said one email spam it out yeah
so

326
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
so
 

327
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,830
so
maybe a pie hole which is an ad blocking

328
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
maybe a pie hole which is an ad blocking
 

329
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,189
maybe a pie hole which is an ad blocking
dns server

330
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
dns server
 

331
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,110
dns server
suddenly becomes not just something to

332
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
suddenly becomes not just something to
 

333
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,790
suddenly becomes not just something to
block your advertising but also

334
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
block your advertising but also
 

335
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,550
block your advertising but also
something to like your ad blocker

336
