and switch to a new system like i think
 

287
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,590
and switch to a new system like i think
like for anybody who's using it

288
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
like for anybody who's using it
 

289

295
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,830
essentially like that's what simple
here's the choice the choice becomes do

296
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840

297
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,550
here's the choice the choice becomes do
we

298
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
we
 

299
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,150
we
now transition to centos stream

300
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
now transition to centos stream
 

301
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,110

go to
uh centos stream and become a rolling

314
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
uh centos stream and become a rolling
 

315
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,629

going to fall under that category ubuntu
is very well supported by

arm could really become the new standard

it's fast and it's cheap yeah and not

554
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
it's fast and it's cheap yeah and not
 

555
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,190
it's fast and it's cheap yeah and not
only that but to think

556
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
only that but to think
 

557
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,750
only that but to think
of all of the single board computers out

558
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
of all of the single board computers out
 

559
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,670
of all of the single board computers out
there that are arm based

560
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
there that are arm based
 

561
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,070
there that are arm based
i mean maybe there's still a hesitation

562
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
i mean maybe there's still a hesitation
 

563
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,590
i mean maybe there's still a hesitation
to put

564
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
to put
 

565
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,150
to put
at least to rely and depend on single

566
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
at least to rely and depend on single
 

567
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,269
at least to rely and depend on single
board computing

568
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
board computing
 

569
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,910
board computing
in the in the data center right and that

570
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
in the in the data center right and that
 

571
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,269
in the in the data center right and that
there is some truth in that

572
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
there is some truth in that
 

573
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,030
there is some truth in that
and and part of that comes from the

574
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
and and part of that comes from the
 

575
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,710
and and part of that comes from the
reliability of storage so you think

576
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
reliability of storage so you think
 

577
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,870
reliability of storage so you think
about a raspberry pi with an sd card

578
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
about a raspberry pi with an sd card
 

579
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,310
about a raspberry pi with an sd card
well do you really want your entire

580
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
well do you really want your entire
 

581
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,389
well do you really want your entire
infrastructure housed on an sd card

582
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
infrastructure housed on an sd card
 

583
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,110
infrastructure housed on an sd card
probably not

584
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
probably not
 

585
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,550
probably not
no but arm is a lot more than just

586
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
no but arm is a lot more than just
 

587
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,070
no but arm is a lot more than just
single board computers and it's not

588
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
single board computers and it's not
 

589
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,829
single board computers and it's not
limited to sd cards

590
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
limited to sd cards
 

591
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,990
limited to sd cards
you look at things from you know boards

592
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
you look at things from you know boards
 

593
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,310
you look at things from you know boards
from odroid you look at boards from pine

594
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
from odroid you look at boards from pine
 

595
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,030
from odroid you look at boards from pine
64 and other competitors to raspberry pi

596
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
64 and other competitors to raspberry pi
 

597
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,190
64 and other competitors to raspberry pi
and they all support emmc yeah and in

598
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
and they all support emmc yeah and in
 

599
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,470
and they all support emmc yeah and in
fact a lot of them

on your single board computer yeah and
now you're running like something that

614
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
now you're running like something that
 

615
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,030
now you're running like something that
is screaming fast

616
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
is screaming fast
 

617
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,389

super super fast super reliable and uh
 

619
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,069
super super fast super reliable and uh
that belongs in the data center if you

620
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
that belongs in the data center if you
 

621
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,910
that belongs in the data center if you
ask me i completely agree

622
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
ask me i completely agree
 

623
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,030
ask me i completely agree
and i mean right now you know in

and i mean right now you know in
 

625
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,310
and i mean right now you know in
my day job we're dealing with servers

626
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
my day job we're dealing with servers
 

627
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,190
my day job we're dealing with servers
and

628
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
and
 

629
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,350
and
you know all this kind of stuff and one

630
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
you know all this kind of stuff and one
 

631
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,389
you know all this kind of stuff and one
of the things we've been talking about

632
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
of the things we've been talking about
 

633
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,670
of the things we've been talking about
lately is getting

634
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
lately is getting
 

635
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,870
lately is getting
our own server and so what you know with

636
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
our own server and so what you know with
 

637
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,310
our own server and so what you know with
this story makes me think

638
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
this story makes me think
 

639
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,310
this story makes me think
are we at the point where we could run

640
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
are we at the point where we could run
 

641
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,829
are we at the point where we could run
uh you know take like a hosting server

642
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
uh you know take like a hosting server
 

643
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,949
uh you know take like a hosting server
or you know you know a cloud server and

644
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
or you know you know a cloud server and
 

645
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,470
or you know you know a cloud server and
run it off you know a rock pro 64 or

646
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
run it off you know a rock pro 64 or
 

647
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,069
run it off you know a rock pro 64 or
something sure why not where you've got

648
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
something sure why not where you've got
 

649
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:48,790
something sure why not where you've got
it hooked up

650
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
it hooked up
 

651
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,069
it hooked up
to you know a whole bunch of terabyte

652
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
to you know a whole bunch of terabyte
 

653
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,110
