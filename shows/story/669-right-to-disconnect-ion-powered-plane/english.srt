uh
 

333
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,550
uh
so it's like have a separate phone yeah

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,950
flight non-stop theoretically unreal
like that's wild becca makes some really

494
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
like that's wild becca makes some really
 

495
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,150
like that's wild becca makes some really
interesting points about

496
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
interesting points about
 

497
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,469
interesting points about
like quadcopter flight and yeah i love

498
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
like quadcopter flight and yeah i love
 

499
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,070
like quadcopter flight and yeah i love
flying my quadcopters but

500
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
flying my quadcopters but
 

501
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,950
flying my quadcopters but
she's right the battery is like in some

502
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
she's right the battery is like in some
 

503
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,189
she's right the battery is like in some
of them it's like 15 minutes flight time

504
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
of them it's like 15 minutes flight time
 

505
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,029
of them it's like 15 minutes flight time
and so you buy extra batteries so that

506
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
and so you buy extra batteries so that
 

507
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,150
and so you buy extra batteries so that
you can swap them in the field and you

508
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
you can swap them in the field and you
 

509
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,230
you can swap them in the field and you
get you know 45 minutes flight time but

510
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
get you know 45 minutes flight time but
 

511
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,790
get you know 45 minutes flight time but
you're still

512
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
you're still
 

513
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,309
you're still
dealing with the fact that the battery

514
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
dealing with the fact that the battery
 

515
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,909
dealing with the fact that the battery
doesn't last very long

516
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
doesn't last very long
 

517
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,589
doesn't last very long
if you ever shoot any video in the air

518
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
if you ever shoot any video in the air
 

519
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,110
if you ever shoot any video in the air
it's the same kind of thing like you get

520
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
it's the same kind of thing like you get
 

521
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,469
it's the same kind of thing like you get
up there you take some video and then

522
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
up there you take some video and then
 

523
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,670
up there you take some video and then
you gotta land and take it and change

524
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
you gotta land and take it and change
 

525
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,390
you gotta land and take it and change
the battery

526
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
the battery
 

527
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,630
the battery
yep well here's an opportunity something

528
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
yep well here's an opportunity something
 

529
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,909
yep well here's an opportunity something
that can actually

530
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
that can actually
 

531
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,709
that can actually
uh power itself essentially yeah but

532
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
uh power itself essentially yeah but
 

533
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,509
uh power itself essentially yeah but
will it ever

534
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
will it ever
 

535
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,949
will it ever
see passenger flight that's

536
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
see passenger flight that's
 

537
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,509
see passenger flight that's
the thing like so it's more like it's

538
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
the thing like so it's more like it's
 

539
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,470
the thing like so it's more like it's
gonna be tough

540
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
gonna be tough
 

541
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,949
gonna be tough
yeah it's gonna be more i think um you

542
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
yeah it's gonna be more i think um you
 

543
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,150
yeah it's gonna be more i think um you
know smaller payload

544
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
know smaller payload
 

545
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,990
know smaller payload
payloads and this is where you know i

546
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
payloads and this is where you know i
 

547
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,070
payloads and this is where you know i
think in terms of a camera

548
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
think in terms of a camera
 

549
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,470
think in terms of a camera
or you know being able to to shoot video

550
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
or you know being able to to shoot video
 

551
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,269
or you know being able to to shoot video
but they're

552
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
but they're
 

553
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,350
but they're
they're flying like an airplane so yeah

554
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
they're flying like an airplane so yeah
 

555
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,590
they're flying like an airplane so yeah
it's going to be moving pretty quickly

556
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
it's going to be moving pretty quickly
 

557
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,910
it's going to be moving pretty quickly
so what about now we've had um henry

558
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
so what about now we've had um henry
 

559
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,990
so what about now we've had um henry
bailey brown on the show to talk about

560
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
bailey brown on the show to talk about
 

561
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,190
bailey brown on the show to talk about
how he uses his quadcopters to shoot

562
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
how he uses his quadcopters to shoot
 

563
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,790
how he uses his quadcopters to shoot
3d imagery

564
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
3d imagery
 

565
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,790
3d imagery
so that he can then convert that into

566
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
so that he can then convert that into
 

567
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,829
so that he can then convert that into
unreal engine

568
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
unreal engine
 

569
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,350
unreal engine
and even 3d print buildings and things

570
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
and even 3d print buildings and things
 

571
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,150
and even 3d print buildings and things
like that

572
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
like that
 

573
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,949
like that
but looking at topography and using a

574
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
but looking at topography and using a
 

575
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,990
but looking at topography and using a
technology like this

576
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
technology like this
 

577
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,790
technology like this
to keep constant tabs on changing

578
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
to keep constant tabs on changing
 

579
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,750
to keep constant tabs on changing
landscapes

580
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
landscapes
 

581
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,030
landscapes
or on like the we think about like bing

582
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
or on like the we think about like bing
 

583
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,790
or on like the we think about like bing
maps or google earth and

584
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
maps or google earth and
 

585
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,870
maps or google earth and
the way that they're able to recreate

586
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
the way that they're able to recreate
 

587
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,150
the way that they're able to recreate
our planet

588
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
our planet
 

589
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,870
our planet
in basically what to us seems like real

590
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
in basically what to us seems like real
 

591
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,870
in basically what to us seems like real
time like sci-fi

592
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
time like sci-fi
 

593
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,310
time like sci-fi
but being able to have something in the

594
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
but being able to have something in the
 

595
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,230
but being able to have something in the
air that can just fly around the globe

596
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
air that can just fly around the globe
 

597
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,350
air that can just fly around the globe
all the time taking this imagery and

598
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
all the time taking this imagery and
 

599
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,670
all the time taking this imagery and
shooting it back to their servers and

600
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
shooting it back to their servers and
 

601
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,710
shooting it back to their servers and
making it like

602
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
making it like
 

603
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,949
making it like
virtually you know much more real time

604
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
virtually you know much more real time
 

605
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,310
virtually you know much more real time
than the satellite imagery that they

606
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
than the satellite imagery that they
 

607
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,829
than the satellite imagery that they
have now that's four years old

608
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
have now that's four years old
 

609
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,310
have now that's four years old
yeah right so could those be things but

610
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
yeah right so could those be things but
 

611
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,190
yeah right so could those be things but
you know what what

612
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
you know what what
 

613
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,949
you know what what
what kind of things spring to mind for

614
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
what kind of things spring to mind for
 

615
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,710
what kind of things spring to mind for
you and of course you know in the back

616
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
you and of course you know in the back
 

617
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,230
you and of course you know in the back
of my mind there is that nagging

618
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
of my mind there is that nagging
 

619
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
of my mind there is that nagging
i fear that the military would get a

620
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
i fear that the military would get a
 

621
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,230
i fear that the military would get a
hold of this kind of technology

622
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
hold of this kind of technology
 

623
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,310
hold of this kind of technology
guaranteed they're already using it i

624
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
guaranteed they're already using it i
 

625
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,670
guaranteed they're already using it i
know and so this is probably from a

626
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
know and so this is probably from a
 

627
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,870
know and so this is probably from a
military contract

628
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
military contract
 

629
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,790
military contract
yeah this is probably going through your

630
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
yeah this is probably going through your
 

631
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,069
yeah this is probably going through your
head and and

632
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
head and and
 

633
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,030
head and and
so there that is very ominous and it's

634
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
so there that is very ominous and it's
 

635
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,630
so there that is very ominous and it's
because this is a really really cool

636
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
because this is a really really cool
 

637
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,310
because this is a really really cool
technology but like so many cool

638
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
technology but like so many cool
 

639
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,430
technology but like so many cool
technologies

640
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
technologies
 

641
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,790
technologies
it could be used for good and it could

642
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
it could be used for good and it could
 

643
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,550
it could be used for good and it could
be used for we'll we'll say

644
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
be used for we'll we'll say
 

645
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,750
be used for we'll we'll say
evil yep um but you know what could we

646
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
evil yep um but you know what could we
 

647
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,430
evil yep um but you know what could we
do with this that is good

648
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
do with this that is good
 

649
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,949
do with this that is good
that's what i'd love to know and that's

650
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
that's what i'd love to know and that's
 

651
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,630
that's what i'd love to know and that's
where my head went

652
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
where my head went
 

653
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,030
where my head went
like the what actually caught my

654
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
like the what actually caught my
 

655
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,870
like the what actually caught my
attention the most in this story was the

656
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
attention the most in this story was the
 

657
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,030
attention the most in this story was the
fact that it was indoor flight

658
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
fact that it was indoor flight
 

659
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,550
fact that it was indoor flight
like initially i was like oh they're

660
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
like initially i was like oh they're
 

661
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,310
like initially i was like oh they're
flying it outside but when they're like

662
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
flying it outside but when they're like
 

663
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,990
flying it outside but when they're like
oh our tests indoors i'm going hold on

664
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
oh our tests indoors i'm going hold on
 

665
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,030
oh our tests indoors i'm going hold on
this is indoors

666
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
this is indoors
 

667
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,230
this is indoors
okay so could you theoretically

668
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
okay so could you theoretically
 

669
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,110
okay so could you theoretically
take this shrink it down i mean who

670
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
take this shrink it down i mean who
 

671
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,150
take this shrink it down i mean who
knows what the components

672
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
knows what the components
 

673
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,949
knows what the components
are you're picturing a fly no no not

674
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
are you're picturing a fly no no not
 

675
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,590
are you're picturing a fly no no not
that small

676
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
that small
 

677
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,670
that small
but like how neat would it be if they

678
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
but like how neat would it be if they
 

679
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,670
but like how neat would it be if they
could take this propulsion system to the

680
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
could take this propulsion system to the
 

681
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,030
could take this propulsion system to the
point where it's

682
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
point where it's
 

683
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,110
point where it's
um you know for lack of a better word

684
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
um you know for lack of a better word
 

685
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,470
um you know for lack of a better word
levitation

686
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
levitation
 

687
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,790
levitation
where you can have a stable object it

688
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
where you can have a stable object it
 

689
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,550
where you can have a stable object it
has to be moving though

690
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
has to be moving though
 

691
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,509
has to be moving though
well it has to right now but if you

692
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
well it has to right now but if you
 

693
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,949
well it has to right now but if you
because it's taking the ions from the

694
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
because it's taking the ions from the
 

695
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,150
because it's taking the ions from the
air and converting them for that

696
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
air and converting them for that
 

697
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,350
air and converting them for that
propulsion system

698
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
propulsion system
 

699
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,110
propulsion system
so i don't know what you know the air

700
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
so i don't know what you know the air
 

701
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,790
so i don't know what you know the air
flow is out behind or anything like that

702
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
flow is out behind or anything like that
 

703
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,430
flow is out behind or anything like that
but

704
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
but
 

705
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,389
but
could it you know i'm i'm thinking could

706
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
could it you know i'm i'm thinking could
 

707
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,150
could it you know i'm i'm thinking could
it be converted to things in your home

708
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
it be converted to things in your home
 

709
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,350
it be converted to things in your home
where it's like

710
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
where it's like
 

711
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,790
where it's like
you don't have to worry about ladders

712
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
you don't have to worry about ladders
 

713
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,030
you don't have to worry about ladders
anymore because you can have

714
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
anymore because you can have
 

715
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,949
anymore because you can have
you know scaffolding or something some

716
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
you know scaffolding or something some
 

717
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,710
you know scaffolding or something some
sort of painting unit that goes up for

718
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
sort of painting unit that goes up for
 

719
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,190
