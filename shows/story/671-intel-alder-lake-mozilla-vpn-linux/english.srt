and we're not going to monitor you we're
 

177
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,149
and we're not going to monitor you we're
not going to lose what it is that you're

doing
um vpns can be very very helpful um we

182
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
um vpns can be very very helpful um we
 

183
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,470
um vpns can be very very helpful um we
talked about proxies on the show before

184
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
talked about proxies on the show before
 

185
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,350
talked about proxies on the show before
um and it's sort of a similar idea but a

186
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
um and it's sort of a similar idea but a
 

187
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,430
um and it's sort of a similar idea but a
vpn allows you to basically place your

188
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
vpn allows you to basically place your
 

189
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,990
vpn allows you to basically place your
ip

190
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
ip
 

191
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,710
ip
elsewhere in the world so that means

192
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
elsewhere in the world so that means
 

193
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,710
elsewhere in the world so that means
even though i'm here in barrie ontario

194
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
even though i'm here in barrie ontario
 

195
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,589
even though i'm here in barrie ontario
canada

196
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
canada
 

197
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,390
canada
i can go on the internet and any website

198
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
i can go on the internet and any website
 

199
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,750
i can go on the internet and any website
or service that i use

200
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
or service that i use
 

201
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,149
or service that i use
will think that i'm in sunny california

202
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
will think that i'm in sunny california
 

203
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,190
will think that i'm in sunny california
yes and

204
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
yes and
 

205
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,070
yes and
so that can be good from and like a

206
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
so that can be good from and like a
 

207
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,149
so that can be good from and like a
privacy perspective because they can't

208
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
privacy perspective because they can't
 

209
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,309
privacy perspective because they can't
tell that i'm from barrie ontario canada

210
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
tell that i'm from barrie ontario canada
 

211
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,390
tell that i'm from barrie ontario canada
but also it can allow me to access

212
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
but also it can allow me to access
 

213
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,390
but also it can allow me to access
services that i can't normally access

214
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
services that i can't normally access
 

215
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,390
services that i can't normally access
yeah up here in canada for example um

216
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
yeah up here in canada for example um
 

217
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,670
yeah up here in canada for example um
we have different services than

218
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
we have different services than
 

219
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,030
we have different services than
in america yes so and sometimes it

220
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
in america yes so and sometimes it
 

221
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,149
in america yes so and sometimes it
is crippled services and so that that

222
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
is crippled services and so that that
 

223
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,190
is crippled services and so that that
can kind of stink and

224
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
can kind of stink and
 

225
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,869
can kind of stink and
and you know maybe there's a gray area

226
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
and you know maybe there's a gray area
 

227
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,869
and you know maybe there's a gray area
there and i don't want to get too far

228
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
there and i don't want to get too far
 

229
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,990
there and i don't want to get too far
into that because

230
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
into that because
 

231
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,070
into that because
it is a little bit of a legal gray area

232
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
it is a little bit of a legal gray area
 

233
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,229
it is a little bit of a legal gray area
but we understand what it means and

234
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
but we understand what it means and
 

235
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,830
but we understand what it means and
um but where it can be helpful as well

236
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
um but where it can be helpful as well
 

237
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,869
um but where it can be helpful as well
is if by um

238
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
is if by um
 

239
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,149
is if by um

that service
using a vpn or a proxy but using a vpn

248
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
using a vpn or a proxy but using a vpn
 

249
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,230
using a vpn or a proxy but using a vpn
in order to be able to continue using

that service
 

253
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,070
that service
and a good example of that would be even

254
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
and a good example of that would be even
 

255
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,189
and a good example of that would be even
so much as where i myself

so big dot little means rather than

622
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
so big dot little means rather than
 

623
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,949
so big dot little means rather than
throttling your processor which is the

624
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
throttling your processor which is the
 

625
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,550
throttling your processor which is the
old traditional intel way

626
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
old traditional intel way
 

627
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,870
old traditional intel way
which is you know take a three gigahertz

628
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
which is you know take a three gigahertz
 

629
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,470
which is you know take a three gigahertz
processor and when you're using it

630
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
processor and when you're using it
 

631
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,230
processor and when you're using it
at its max it's going to be 3.2

632
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
at its max it's going to be 3.2
 

633
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,509
at its max it's going to be 3.2
gigahertz but then

634
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
gigahertz but then
 

635
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,110
gigahertz but then
when you idle it's going to go down to

636
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
when you idle it's going to go down to
 

637
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,790
when you idle it's going to go down to
one gigahertz

638
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
one gigahertz
 

639
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,430
one gigahertz
and and so you know that's the old way

640
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
and and so you know that's the old way
 

641
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,190
and and so you know that's the old way
throttling

642
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200

643
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,550
throttling
this is multiple cores and some of the

644
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
this is multiple cores and some of the
 

645
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,150
this is multiple cores and some of the
cores the little ones

646
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
cores the little ones
 

647
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,389
cores the little ones
are simply more energy efficient so it

648
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
are simply more energy efficient so it
 

649
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,230
are simply more energy efficient so it
will choose based on the task

650
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
will choose based on the task
 

651
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,790
will choose based on the task
which cores are being utilized for that

652
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
which cores are being utilized for that
 

653
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,509
which cores are being utilized for that
task

654
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
task
 

655
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,949
task
it's quite interesting and that's

656
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
it's quite interesting and that's
 

657
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,030
it's quite interesting and that's
something that that you know

658
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
something that that you know
 

659
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,630
something that that you know
arm has been doing for a long time we

660
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
arm has been doing for a long time we
 

661
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,150
arm has been doing for a long time we
see it on single board computers we're

662
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
see it on single board computers we're
 

663
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,230
see it on single board computers we're
talking about the rock pro 64.

664
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
talking about the rock pro 64.
 

665
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,069
talking about the rock pro 64.
the rock pro 64 has six cores

666
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
the rock pro 64 has six cores
 

667
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,710
the rock pro 64 has six cores
it's a single board computer with two

668
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
it's a single board computer with two
 

669
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,590
it's a single board computer with two
big cores

670
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
big cores
 

671
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,389
big cores
and four little cores yeah and so it's

672
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
and four little cores yeah and so it's
 

673
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:10,949
and four little cores yeah and so it's
able to

674
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
able to
 

675
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,269
able to
really perform well when it needs to but

676
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
really perform well when it needs to but
 

677
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,470
really perform well when it needs to but
then when it needs to be energy

678
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
then when it needs to be energy
 

679
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,430
then when it needs to be energy
efficient or

680
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
efficient or
 

681
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,430
efficient or
just being used as a you know an idle

682
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
just being used as a you know an idle
 

683
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,590
just being used as a you know an idle
server it's going to utilize it's going

684
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
server it's going to utilize it's going
 

685
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:19,829
server it's going to utilize it's going
to

686
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
to
 

687
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,190
to
use a very small little trickle of power

688
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
use a very small little trickle of power
 

689
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,590
use a very small little trickle of power
right but that you know that alludes to

mac as well well yeah exactly but
 

707
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,870
mac as well well yeah exactly but
for the longest time intel was like

for the longest time intel was like
 

709
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,790
for the longest time intel was like
the one to watch it was like if

arm-based yeah intel's new chips
are utilizing a similar technology to

are utilizing a similar technology to
 

731
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,430
are utilizing a similar technology to
what arm is already doing

over
 

745
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,670

they are and i can't wait to have
 

747
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,509
they are and i can't wait to have
arm servers and this really we have the

748
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
arm servers and this really we have the
 

749
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,269
arm servers and this really we have the
discussion about armed servers in the

750
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
discussion about armed servers in the
 

751
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,310
discussion about armed servers in the
server room yeah i

752
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
server room yeah i
 

753
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,910
server room yeah i
it never even crossed my mind about

754
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
it never even crossed my mind about
 

755
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,509
it never even crossed my mind about
big.little no

756
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
big.little no
 

757
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,790
big.little no
and so now i'm thinking oh my goodness

758
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
and so now i'm thinking oh my goodness
 

759
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,350
and so now i'm thinking oh my goodness
for my debian web server running on

760
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
for my debian web server running on
 

761
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,389
for my debian web server running on
these extremely efficient cores

762
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
these extremely efficient cores
 

763
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,990
these extremely efficient cores
and then suddenly there's a burst of

764
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
and then suddenly there's a burst of
 

765
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,550
and then suddenly there's a burst of
traffic and mysql goes crazy and so it

766
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
traffic and mysql goes crazy and so it
 

767
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,310
traffic and mysql goes crazy and so it
needs to use the big cores

768
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
needs to use the big cores
 

769
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,790
needs to use the big cores
that's a fantastic scenario absolutely

770
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
that's a fantastic scenario absolutely
 

771
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,629
that's a fantastic scenario absolutely
i'm loving where that's going

772
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
i'm loving where that's going
 

773
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,350
i'm loving where that's going
but is you know where where is intel

774
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
but is you know where where is intel
 

775
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,790
but is you know where where is intel
going to fall into all this it's an

776
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
going to fall into all this it's an
 

777
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,509
going to fall into all this it's an
interesting thing

778
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
interesting thing
 

779
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,110
interesting thing
and then amd is doing their own thing

780
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
and then amd is doing their own thing
 

781
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,550
and then amd is doing their own thing
and they're doing really really well at

782
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
and they're doing really really well at
 

783
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,030
and they're doing really really well at
it yes

784
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
it yes
 

785
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,030
it yes
