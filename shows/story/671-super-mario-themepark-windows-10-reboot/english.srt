662
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
started working so i didn't have to go
 

663
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,190
started working so i didn't have to go
through this the worst thing is when

664
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
through this the worst thing is when
 

665
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,509
through this the worst thing is when
that update comes up on the screen and

666
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
that update comes up on the screen and
 

667
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,870
that update comes up on the screen and
you can't get out of it

668
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
you can't get out of it
 

669
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,550
you can't get out of it
it's like full screen and it blocks

670
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
it's like full screen and it blocks
 

671
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,069
it's like full screen and it blocks
everything so you're in the you might be

672
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
everything so you're in the you might be
 

673
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,190
everything so you're in the you might be
in the middle of something

674
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
in the middle of something
 

675
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,430
in the middle of something
and suddenly yeah you're locked out now

676
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
and suddenly yeah you're locked out now
 

677
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,310
and suddenly yeah you're locked out now
this is a case

678
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
this is a case
 

679
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,350
this is a case
once again where microsoft has

680
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
once again where microsoft has
 

681
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,710
once again where microsoft has
updated windows 10 and introduced

682
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
updated windows 10 and introduced
 

683
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,910
updated windows 10 and introduced
a problem that previously didn't exist

684
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
a problem that previously didn't exist
 

685
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,470
a problem that previously didn't exist
yeah and that i mean i don't have to say

686
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
yeah and that i mean i don't have to say
 

687
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,910
yeah and that i mean i don't have to say
that bugs me i think that

688
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
that bugs me i think that
 

689
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,389
that bugs me i think that
that bugs all of us that that kind of

690
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
that bugs all of us that that kind of
 

691
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,150
that bugs all of us that that kind of
thing still happens

692
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
thing still happens
 

693
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,269
thing still happens
yeah but we we've you know we've been

694
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
yeah but we we've you know we've been
 

695
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,230
yeah but we we've you know we've been
through this

696
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
through this
 

697
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,230
through this
it seems like it's a recurring theme

698
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
it seems like it's a recurring theme
 

699
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,150
it seems like it's a recurring theme
that microsoft keeps doing this where

700
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
that microsoft keeps doing this where
 

701
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,269
that microsoft keeps doing this where
they're breaking

702
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
they're breaking
 

703
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,829
they're breaking
systems and at least they're consistent

704
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
systems and at least they're consistent
 

705
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,430
systems and at least they're consistent
you know what you're getting

706
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
you know what you're getting
 

707
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,389
you know what you're getting
bugs you know what you're getting this

708
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
bugs you know what you're getting this
 

709
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,110
bugs you know what you're getting this
is where that

710
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
is where that
 

711
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,110
is where that
slight linux bias comes in and we say

712
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
slight linux bias comes in and we say
 

713
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,030
slight linux bias comes in and we say
hey check out linux mint

714
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
hey check out linux mint
 

715
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,069
hey check out linux mint
check out ubuntu check out ubuntu mate

716
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
check out ubuntu check out ubuntu mate
 

717
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,230
check out ubuntu check out ubuntu mate
yeah what else can we say debian

718
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
yeah what else can we say debian
 

719
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,310
yeah what else can we say debian
definitely debian just about anything

720
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
definitely debian just about anything
 

721
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,069
definitely debian just about anything
just not centos yeah it's

722
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
just not centos yeah it's
 

723
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,030
just not centos yeah it's
i don't know why this stuff doesn't get

724
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
i don't know why this stuff doesn't get
 

725
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,670
i don't know why this stuff doesn't get
caught first by windows

726
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680

727
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,550

731
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,389
software developing
uh as software developers it's it's

732
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
uh as software developers it's it's
 

733
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,870
uh as software developers it's it's
virtually impossible to think of every

734
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
virtually impossible to think of every
 

735
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,670
virtually impossible to think of every
sure every case of every scenario um

736
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
sure every case of every scenario um
 

737
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,790
sure every case of every scenario um
sometimes it has to do with the

738
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
sometimes it has to do with the
 

739
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,430
sometimes it has to do with the

particular
 

741
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,269
particular
graphics drivers you have and like they

742
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
graphics drivers you have and like they
 

743
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,949
graphics drivers you have and like they
just can't test

744
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
just can't test
 

745
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,110
just can't test
everything but you know in it

746
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
everything but you know in it
 

747
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,269
everything but you know in it
one of the one of the practices that we

748
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
one of the one of the practices that we
 

749
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,110
one of the one of the practices that we
have is

750
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
have is
 

751
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,790
have is
okay we're going to make a big change to

752
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
okay we're going to make a big change to
 

753
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,990
okay we're going to make a big change to
the network we have 1200 computers

754
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
the network we have 1200 computers
 

755
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,829
the network we have 1200 computers
we're going to push this out to five

756
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
we're going to push this out to five
 

757
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,509
we're going to push this out to five
isolated systems first

758
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
isolated systems first
 

759
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,350
isolated systems first
we're gonna see how it goes and then we

760
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
we're gonna see how it goes and then we
 

761
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,550
we're gonna see how it goes and then we
wait it out we see

762
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
wait it out we see
 

763
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,949
wait it out we see
how everything goes right great okay a

764
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
how everything goes right great okay a
 

765
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,829
how everything goes right great okay a
couple of days of

766
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
couple of days of
 

767
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,990
couple of days of
have passed let's push that out to 30

768
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
have passed let's push that out to 30
 

769
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,110
have passed let's push that out to 30
systems

770
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
systems
 

771
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,550
systems
and let's see if any complaints or

772
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
and let's see if any complaints or
 

773
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,550
and let's see if any complaints or
problems come in and as we

774
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
problems come in and as we
 

775
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,430
problems come in and as we
work through those things then we feel

776
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
work through those things then we feel
 

777
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,030
work through those things then we feel
confident and we can push it out to the

778
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
confident and we can push it out to the
 

779
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,389
confident and we can push it out to the
1200 systems

780
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
1200 systems
 

781
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,870
1200 systems
right but you've got windows is on

782
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
right but you've got windows is on
 

783
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,629
right but you've got windows is on
probably billions of computers

784
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
probably billions of computers
 

785
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,389
probably billions of computers
right so why do they not have a test

786
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
right so why do they not have a test
 

787
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,670
right so why do they not have a test
well why don't they run their update on

788
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
well why don't they run their update on
 

789
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,509
well why don't they run their update on
all of their systems one percent

790
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
all of their systems one percent
 

791
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,949
all of their systems one percent
of those ten systems yeah let's

792
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
of those ten systems yeah let's
 

793
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,269
of those ten systems yeah let's
release this update to one percent yeah

794
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
release this update to one percent yeah
 

795
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,790
release this update to one percent yeah
let's see what happens

796
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
let's see what happens
 

797
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,870
let's see what happens
but could you i'd hate to be the one

798
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
but could you i'd hate to be the one
 

799
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,910
but could you i'd hate to be the one
percent

800
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
percent
 

801
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,470
percent
yeah but at least then they could fix it

802
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
yeah but at least then they could fix it
 

803
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,190
yeah but at least then they could fix it
before

804
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
before
 

805
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,590
before
pushing it out to billions of people

806
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
pushing it out to billions of people
 

807
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,430
pushing it out to billions of people
yeah and i mean i'm sure that this kind

808
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
yeah and i mean i'm sure that this kind
 

809
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,750
yeah and i mean i'm sure that this kind
of

810
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
of
 

811
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,310
of
i can exaggerate you know like it was

812
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
i can exaggerate you know like it was
 

813
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,670
i can exaggerate you know like it was
isolated cases

814
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
isolated cases
 

815
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,590
isolated cases
i mean i say that sure loosely it wasn't

816
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
i mean i say that sure loosely it wasn't
 

817
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,790
i mean i say that sure loosely it wasn't
every system yeah

818
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
every system yeah
 

819
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,790
every system yeah
but imagine if like a a government

820
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
but imagine if like a a government
 

821
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,550
but imagine if like a a government
defense computer was running windows and

822
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
defense computer was running windows and
 

823
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,430
defense computer was running windows and
