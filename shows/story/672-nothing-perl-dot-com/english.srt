yeah it is you know it's it's like what

228
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
yeah it is you know it's it's like what
 

229
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,309
yeah it is you know it's it's like what
do you need to make this happen

230
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
do you need to make this happen
 

231
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,589
do you need to make this happen
nothing because it's going to be so

232
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
nothing because it's going to be so
 

233
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,270
nothing because it's going to be so
seamless it's really it's no different

234
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
seamless it's really it's no different
 

235
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,990

than uh elon musk and his boring company

236
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
than uh elon musk and his boring company
 

237
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,430
than uh elon musk and his boring company
yeah i think so it's like the name is

238
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
yeah i think so it's like the name is
 

239
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,430
yeah i think so it's like the name is
boring oh yes

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
boring oh yes
 

241
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,149
boring oh yes
it's for play on words yeah exactly so i

242
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
it's for play on words yeah exactly so i
 

243
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,470
it's for play on words yeah exactly so i
i

244
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
i
 

245
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,670
i
like that and i mean this is an

246
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
like that and i mean this is an
 

247
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,990
like that and i mean this is an
interesting concept uh to have

248
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
interesting concept uh to have
 

249
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,869
interesting concept uh to have
everything run

250
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
everything run
 

251
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,910
everything run
so seamlessly across multiple devices

252
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
so seamlessly across multiple devices
 

253
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,910
so seamlessly across multiple devices
it's not a new concept

254
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
it's not a new concept
 

255
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,390
it's not a new concept
it's been in sci-fi since the 80s right

256
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
it's been in sci-fi since the 80s right
 

257
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,550
it's been in sci-fi since the 80s right
yeah but what he's looking to do is

258
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
yeah but what he's looking to do is
 

259
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,390
yeah but what he's looking to do is
so interesting because everybody else

260
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
so interesting because everybody else
 

261
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,550
so interesting because everybody else
right now piecemeals

262
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
right now piecemeals
 

263
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,309
right now piecemeals
their internet of things so it's like oh

264
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
their internet of things so it's like oh
 

265
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,670
their internet of things so it's like oh
we'll connect with this we'll connect

266
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
we'll connect with this we'll connect
 

267
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,149
we'll connect with this we'll connect
that

268
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
that
 

269
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,589
that
but you have to do so much in the

270
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
but you have to do so much in the
 

271
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,069
but you have to do so much in the
background like if you have say an echo

272
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
background like if you have say an echo
 

273
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,150
background like if you have say an echo
from from amazon yeah it's like you have

274
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
from from amazon yeah it's like you have
 

275
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,110
from from amazon yeah it's like you have
to install the skill

276
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
to install the skill
 

277
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,870
to install the skill
and then it connects with that it's like

278
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
and then it connects with that it's like
 

279
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,790
and then it connects with that it's like
there's so much setup

280
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
there's so much setup
 

281
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,710
there's so much setup
it'd be neat to see how this all plays

282
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
it'd be neat to see how this all plays
 

283
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,230
it'd be neat to see how this all plays
out and i mean he says

284
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
out and i mean he says
 

285
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,710
out and i mean he says
what was it 20 to 30 years i don't think

286
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
what was it 20 to 30 years i don't think
 

287
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,830
what was it 20 to 30 years i don't think
it's going to be that long

288
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
it's going to be that long
 

289
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,670
it's going to be that long
i mean look how much technology has

290
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
i mean look how much technology has
 

291
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,870
i mean look how much technology has
changed oh sure

292
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
changed oh sure
 

293
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,990
changed oh sure
well you know what's going to happen is

294
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
well you know what's going to happen is
 

295
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,909
well you know what's going to happen is
we're going to see the initial

296
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
we're going to see the initial
 

297
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,469
we're going to see the initial
you know what what are the first devices

298
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
you know what what are the first devices
 

299
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,990
you know what what are the first devices
yeah for sure that we'll probably

300
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
yeah for sure that we'll probably
 

301
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,749
yeah for sure that we'll probably
see within the next couple of years and

302
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
see within the next couple of years and
 

303
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,430
see within the next couple of years and
and as we do we'll start to see the

304
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
and as we do we'll start to see the
 

305
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,070
and as we do we'll start to see the
vision that

306
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
vision that
 

307
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,749
vision that
uh that carl pay has for nothing

308
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
uh that carl pay has for nothing
 

309
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,230
uh that carl pay has for nothing
yeah that's gonna be just a funny play

310
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
yeah that's gonna be just a funny play
 

311
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,110
yeah that's gonna be just a funny play
on words for the

312
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
on words for the
 

313
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,270
on words for the
for the next while for sure but one day

314
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
for the next while for sure but one day
 

315
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,710
for the next while for sure but one day
this is going to be

316
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
this is going to be
 

317
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,390
this is going to be
it's like google when google first

318
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
it's like google when google first
 

319
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,390
it's like google when google first
started it's like it was such a silly

320
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
started it's like it was such a silly
 

321
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,950
started it's like it was such a silly
word

322
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
word
 

323
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,670
word
right but then now it's like synonymous

324
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
right but then now it's like synonymous
 

325
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,590
right but then now it's like synonymous
it's being used as a verb for searching

326
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
it's being used as a verb for searching
 

327
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,469
it's being used as a verb for searching
the internet

328
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
the internet
 

329
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,870
the internet
and it's so much more than just search

330
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
and it's so much more than just search
 

331
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,469
and it's so much more than just search
well and google's a great example

332

well and google's a great example
because there's so much going on

334
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
because there's so much going on
 

335
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,230
because there's so much going on
in the background with google yeah that

336
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
in the background with google yeah that
 

337
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,430
in the background with google yeah that
you don't know

338
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
you don't know
 

339
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,150
you don't know
yeah like if people knew truly how much

340
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
yeah like if people knew truly how much
 

341
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,230
yeah like if people knew truly how much
google was impacting their lives

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
google was impacting their lives
 

343
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,990
google was impacting their lives
and the background that goes on with

344
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
and the background that goes on with
 

345
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,590
and the background that goes on with
like the the search bots and the

346
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
like the the search bots and the
 

347
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,390
like the the search bots and the
different

algorithms and whatnot they would go oh

350
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
algorithms and whatnot they would go oh
 

351
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,590

my goodness like there's

352
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
my goodness like there's
 

353
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,629
my goodness like there's
so much engaged here and so so google

help already has been doing this

356
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
help already has been doing this
 

357
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,590
help already has been doing this
a little bit but not to the point of it

358
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
a little bit but not to the point of it
 

359
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,510
a little bit but not to the point of it
being an assistance in life

360
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
being an assistance in life
 

361
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,510
being an assistance in life
yeah it's more so in assistance with the

362
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
yeah it's more so in assistance with the
 

363
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,629
yeah it's more so in assistance with the
internet

364
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
internet
 

365
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,990
internet
so it's going to be interesting to see

366
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
so it's going to be interesting to see
 

367
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,909
so it's going to be interesting to see
how this plays out but it does what i

368
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
how this plays out but it does what i
 

369
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,629
how this plays out but it does what i
mean

370
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
mean
 

371
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,909
mean
for me the one thing it brings to mind

372
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
for me the one thing it brings to mind
 

373
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,110
for me the one thing it brings to mind
is um privacy

374
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
is um privacy
 

375
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,270
is um privacy
if everything is so seamless to the

376
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
if everything is so seamless to the
 

377
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,710
if everything is so seamless to the
point that you don't even have to worry

378
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
point that you don't even have to worry
 

379
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,830
point that you don't even have to worry
about it because it just takes

380
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
about it because it just takes
 

381
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,230
about it because it just takes
care of itself is there a privacy

382
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
care of itself is there a privacy
 

383
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,110
care of itself is there a privacy
concern

384
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
concern
 

385
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,550
concern
and is there eventually going to be

386
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
and is there eventually going to be
 

387
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,270
and is there eventually going to be
pushback on that where people are going

388
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
pushback on that where people are going
 

389
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,790
pushback on that where people are going
hold on this is so seamless i don't

390
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
hold on this is so seamless i don't
 

391
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,710
hold on this is so seamless i don't
actually realize what it's doing

392
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
actually realize what it's doing
 

393
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,230
actually realize what it's doing
and so that's going to be an interesting

394
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
and so that's going to be an interesting
 

395
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,870
and so that's going to be an interesting
development over the years to see

396
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
development over the years to see
 

397
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,950
development over the years to see
where does that take us and is is it

398
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
where does that take us and is is it
 

399
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,710
where does that take us and is is it
crossing the line it's an interesting

400
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
crossing the line it's an interesting
 

401
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,870
crossing the line it's an interesting
point and and look back at this video

402
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
point and and look back at this video
 

403
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,629
point and and look back at this video
you know five years from now and say hey

404
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
you know five years from now and say hey
 

405
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,070
you know five years from now and say hey
jeff called it right

406
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
jeff called it right

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,550
jeff called it right
um because as companies develop

408
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
um because as companies develop
 

409
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,830
um because as companies develop
technologies that require

410
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
technologies that require
 

411
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,150
technologies that require
less and less user intervention to get

412
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
less and less user intervention to get
 

413
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,909
less and less user intervention to get
things like setup done and

414
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
things like setup done and
 

415
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,830
things like setup done and
and you mentioned the echo devices and

416
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
and you mentioned the echo devices and
 

417
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,469
and you mentioned the echo devices and
it's like it has become a very seamless

418
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
it's like it has become a very seamless
 

419
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,270
it's like it has become a very seamless
process i mean i bought a light that i

420
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
process i mean i bought a light that i
 

421
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,309
process i mean i bought a light that i
simply plugged in

422
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
simply plugged in
 

423
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,629
simply plugged in
and it showed up in my in my app and it

424
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
and it showed up in my in my app and it
 

425
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,510
and it showed up in my in my app and it
was like and

426
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
was like and
 

427
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,870
was like and
automatically connected and i could

428
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
automatically connected and i could
 

429
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,189
automatically connected and i could
start using voice commands to control it

430
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
start using voice commands to control it
 

431
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,990
start using voice commands to control it
because it's on the same wi-fi as my

432
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
because it's on the same wi-fi as my
 

433
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,830
because it's on the same wi-fi as my
echo device so it was able to pick it up

434
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
echo device so it was able to pick it up
 

435
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,029
echo device so it was able to pick it up
and detect it and

436
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
and detect it and
 

437
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,309
and detect it and
worked so but as

438
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
worked so but as
 

439
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,469
worked so but as
things get more and more easy from the

440
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
things get more and more easy from the
 

441
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,070
things get more and more easy from the
end user perspective

442
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
end user perspective
 

443
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,309
end user perspective
to set up and to use it does take away

444
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
to set up and to use it does take away
 

445
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,830
to set up and to use it does take away
our ability to understand the technology

446
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
our ability to understand the technology
 

447
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,830
our ability to understand the technology
but that's where

448
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
but that's where
 

449
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,110
but that's where
we're going to have to surpass that

450
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
we're going to have to surpass that
 

451
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,589
we're going to have to surpass that
point where we've crossed over into

452
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
point where we've crossed over into
 

453
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,670
point where we've crossed over into
now we no longer understand the

454
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
now we no longer understand the
 

455
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,749
now we no longer understand the
underlying technologies of the things

456
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
underlying technologies of the things
 

457
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,270
underlying technologies of the things
that we're using day-to-day

458
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
that we're using day-to-day
 

459
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,510
that we're using day-to-day
yeah we're already there but there is

460
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
yeah we're already there but there is
 

461
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,110
yeah we're already there but there is
that push back that's right

462
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
that push back that's right
 

463
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,629
that push back that's right
and so that's and that holds up

464
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
and so that's and that holds up
 

465
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,790
and so that's and that holds up
innovation and as innovation pushes

466
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
innovation and as innovation pushes
 

467
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,390
innovation and as innovation pushes
toward that

468
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
toward that
 

469
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,990
toward that
there is going to have to be something's

470
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
there is going to have to be something's
