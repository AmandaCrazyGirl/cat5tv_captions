yeah
so it makes me wonder if this is one of

286
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
so it makes me wonder if this is one of
 

287
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,749
so it makes me wonder if this is one of
those cases where somebody had

288
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
those cases where somebody had
 

289
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,629
those cases where somebody had

you know even though they're coming in
 

301
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,909
you know even though they're coming in
like hey it's going to expire it's going

302
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
like hey it's going to expire it's going
 

303
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,629

expire
and they need to see it it's possible i

308
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
and they need to see it it's possible i
 

309
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,110
and they need to see it it's possible i
take a different approach and what i do

310
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
take a different approach and what i do
 

311
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,070
take a different approach and what i do
is i set up automatic renewal

312
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
is i set up automatic renewal

they had on file and the contact that
they had on file might have been

336
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
they had on file might have been

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,550
they had on file might have been
somebody that's not with the company now

338
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
somebody that's not with the company now
 

339
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,230
somebody that's not with the company now
oh that could be it could be another

340
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
oh that could be it could be another
 

341
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,749
oh that could be it could be another
there's so many

342
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
there's so many
 

343
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,830
there's so many
you know possibilities as to what could

344
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
you know possibilities as to what could
 

345
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,870
you know possibilities as to what could
have happened but

346
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
have happened but
 

347
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,510
have happened but
i mean this is a big deal because it

348
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
i mean this is a big deal because it
 

349
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,670
i mean this is a big deal because it
knocked out the infrastructure that is

350
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
knocked out the infrastructure that is
 

351
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,350
knocked out the infrastructure that is
there for email service

352
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
there for email service
 

353
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,790
there for email service
around the world so

354
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
around the world so
 

355
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,909
around the world so
understanding that so many services

356
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
understanding that so many services
 

357
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,790
understanding that so many services
depend on the reporting of services such

358
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
depend on the reporting of services such
 

359
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,749
depend on the reporting of services such
as spam comp

360
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
as spam comp
 

361
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,550
as spam comp
so if spam cop stops responding all of a

362
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
so if spam cop stops responding all of a
 

363
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,590
so if spam cop stops responding all of a
sudden

364
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
sudden
 

365
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,310
sudden
they just say oh well reject that email

366
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
they just say oh well reject that email
 

367
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,510
they just say oh well reject that email
yeah

368
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
yeah
 

369
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,590
yeah
which is a you know that's maybe a

370
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
which is a you know that's maybe a
 

371
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,710
which is a you know that's maybe a
little bit of a

372
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
little bit of a
 

373
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,870
little bit of a
flaw in the infrastructure absolutely

374
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
flaw in the infrastructure absolutely
 

375
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,309
flaw in the infrastructure absolutely
it's like a single point of failure

376
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
it's like a single point of failure
 

377
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:00,950
it's like a single point of failure
right well

378
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
right well
 

379
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,390
right well
and there should be redundancies in that

380
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
and there should be redundancies in that
 

381
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,550
and there should be redundancies in that
case where if that doesn't work

382
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
case where if that doesn't work
 

383
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,550
case where if that doesn't work
here's your secondary backup yeah you

384
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
here's your secondary backup yeah you
 

385
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,189
here's your secondary backup yeah you
know but it all it still falls on

386
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
know but it all it still falls on
 

387
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,189
know but it all it still falls on
cisco to have those backups in place

388
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
cisco to have those backups in place
 

389
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,469
cisco to have those backups in place
that's right you know so

390
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
that's right you know so
 

391
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,749
that's right you know so
so what do you do because as soon as you

392
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
so what do you do because as soon as you
 

393
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,830
so what do you do because as soon as you
put a redundancy in that says if spam

394
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
put a redundancy in that says if spam
 

395
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,029
put a redundancy in that says if spam
spam cop is not responding reroute it

here now there's something that we can
 

399
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,350
here now there's something that we can
exploit

400
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
exploit
 

401
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,029
exploit
right there's something that we can use

402
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
right there's something that we can use
 

403
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,110
right there's something that we can use
to get around spam cop

404
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
to get around spam cop
 

405
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,510
to get around spam cop
yeah which is you know concern and what

would have happened
if somebody was wise to the fact that oh

410
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
if somebody was wise to the fact that oh
 

411

uh how registration works is that

438
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
uh how registration works is that
 

439
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,790
uh how registration works is that
there's a 30-day grace that's right

440
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
there's a 30-day grace that's right
 

441

663
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,630
you know i think is an amazing thing
sure is it's totally

664
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
sure is it's totally
 

665
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,590
sure is it's totally
within the realm of you know acceptable

666
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
within the realm of you know acceptable
 

667
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,430
within the realm of you know acceptable
use of technology

668
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
use of technology
 

669
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,110
use of technology
to have that link to be able to give

670
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
to have that link to be able to give
 

671
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,710
to have that link to be able to give
people a better sense of quality of life

672
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
people a better sense of quality of life
 

673
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,110
people a better sense of quality of life
which i

674
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
which i
 

675
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,710
which i
absolutely love and i think it's so

amazing you know monkey's playing pong

678
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
amazing you know monkey's playing pong
 

679
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,269
amazing you know monkey's playing pong
or i guess it was the pig playing pong

680
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
or i guess it was the pig playing pong
 

681
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,710
or i guess it was the pig playing pong
but you know whatever game the monkey

682
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
but you know whatever game the monkey
 

683
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,910
but you know whatever game the monkey
was playing every monkey yeah

684
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
was playing every monkey yeah
 

685
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,150
was playing every monkey yeah
you have to you know test it somewhere

686
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
you have to you know test it somewhere
 

687
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,509
you have to you know test it somewhere
but this is

688
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
but this is
 

689
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,670
but this is
this is an interesting story because if

690
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
this is an interesting story because if
 

691
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,949
this is an interesting story because if
it does

692
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
it does
 

693
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,389
it does
work in the way that they hope to

694
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
work in the way that they hope to
 

695
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,150
work in the way that they hope to
advance it's going to change people's

696
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
advance it's going to change people's
 

697
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,829
advance it's going to change people's
lives for sure it is

698
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
lives for sure it is
 

699
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,590
lives for sure it is
yeah if it's used for the good now it

700
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
yeah if it's used for the good now it
 

701
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,110
yeah if it's used for the good now it
could also power mechs

702
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
could also power mechs
 

703
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,269
could also power mechs
sure well and i mean that's going to be

704
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
sure well and i mean that's going to be
 

705
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,030
sure well and i mean that's going to be
you know one of the byproducts of it

706
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
you know one of the byproducts of it
 

707
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,949
you know one of the byproducts of it
it's like we can do this for good but oh

708
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
it's like we can do this for good but oh
 

709
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,710
it's like we can do this for good but oh
you know how somebody be able to use

710
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
you know how somebody be able to use
 

711
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,470
you know how somebody be able to use
this negatively i mean like i was

712
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
this negatively i mean like i was
 

713
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,630
this negatively i mean like i was
reading an article the other day that

714
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
reading an article the other day that
 

715
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,910
reading an article the other day that
uh drones are now getting faster than uh

716
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
uh drones are now getting faster than uh
 

717
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,030
uh drones are now getting faster than uh
you know we our uh defense mechanisms

718
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
you know we our uh defense mechanisms
 

719
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,990
you know we our uh defense mechanisms
can actually

720
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
can actually
 

721
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,910
can actually
address sure so it's like well

722
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
address sure so it's like well
 

723
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,630
address sure so it's like well
absolutely so now

724
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
absolutely so now
 

725
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,230
absolutely so now
you know and we're talking like neural

726
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
you know and we're talking like neural
 

727
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,069
you know and we're talking like neural
links so neuralink is to

728
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
links so neuralink is to
 

729
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,550
links so neuralink is to
augment the human brain because the

730
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
augment the human brain because the
 

731
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,310
augment the human brain because the
human brain is the fastest computer on

732
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
human brain is the fastest computer on
 

733
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,509
human brain is the fastest computer on
the planet that's right

734
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
the planet that's right
 

735
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,470
the planet that's right
and possibly in the entire universe so

736
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
and possibly in the entire universe so
 

737
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,910
and possibly in the entire universe so
if we can now augment that

738
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
if we can now augment that
 

739
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,509
if we can now augment that
and make it so that it can communicate

740
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
and make it so that it can communicate
 

741
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,670
and make it so that it can communicate
in real time with computers

742
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
in real time with computers
 

743
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,190
in real time with computers
now ai and humans can interact at the

744
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
now ai and humans can interact at the
 

745
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,910
now ai and humans can interact at the
same

746
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
same
 

747
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,430
same
speed yeah fear like hey i'm simplifying

748
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
speed yeah fear like hey i'm simplifying
 

749
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,310
speed yeah fear like hey i'm simplifying
right but

750
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
right but
 

751
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,470
right but
so then it it raises the concerns well

752
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
so then it it raises the concerns well
 

753
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,710
so then it it raises the concerns well
what if ai wants to do some

754
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
what if ai wants to do some
 

755
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,590
what if ai wants to do some
some damage right because that's that's

756
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
some damage right because that's that's
 

757
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,790
some damage right because that's that's
the

758
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
the
 

759
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,829
the
you know the sci-fi future is of course

760
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
you know the sci-fi future is of course
 

761
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:09,990
you know the sci-fi future is of course
dystopian

762
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
dystopian
 

763
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,790
dystopian
ai has taken over and and humans are now

764
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
ai has taken over and and humans are now
 

765
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,389
ai has taken over and and humans are now
under their control so there's all these

766
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
under their control so there's all these
 

767
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,550
under their control so there's all these
kinds of crazy concerns

768
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
kinds of crazy concerns
 

769
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,990
kinds of crazy concerns
so there have to be things put into

770
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
so there have to be things put into
 

771
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,550
so there have to be things put into
place to protect absolutely the user

772
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
place to protect absolutely the user
 

773
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,670
place to protect absolutely the user
but from a perspective of medical uh so

774
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
but from a perspective of medical uh so
 

775
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,230
but from a perspective of medical uh so
cool

776
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
cool
 

777
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,829
cool
absolutely fantastic and i mean i'm

absolutely fantastic and i mean i'm
 

779
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,829
absolutely fantastic and i mean i'm
thinking even um you know you've got

780
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
thinking even um you know you've got
 

781
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,030
thinking even um you know you've got
people who

782
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
people who
 

783
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,030
people who
you know have you know degenerative

784
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
you know have you know degenerative
 

785
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,310
you know have you know degenerative
brain um

786
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
brain um
 

787
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,310
brain um
you know like uh alzheimer's and

788
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
you know like uh alzheimer's and
 

789
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,509
you know like uh alzheimer's and
difficulty

790
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
difficulty
 

791
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,030
difficulty
lose the ability to talk i mean you

792

lose the ability to talk i mean you
 

793
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,870
lose the ability to talk i mean you
think of als

794
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
think of als
 

795
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,350
think of als
how you know obviously you know als you

796
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
how you know obviously you know als you
 

797
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,790
how you know obviously you know als you
you lose that ability but

798
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
you lose that ability but
 

799
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,629
you lose that ability but
your mind is still active how amazing

800
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
your mind is still active how amazing
 

801
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,629
your mind is still active how amazing
would it be to be able to have that

802
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
would it be to be able to have that
 

803
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,590
would it be to be able to have that
neural link

804
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
neural link
 

805
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,509
neural link
to be able to it's like hey i can't talk

806
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
to be able to it's like hey i can't talk
 

807
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,790
to be able to it's like hey i can't talk
to you personally but here it is through

808
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
to you personally but here it is through
 

809
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,389
to you personally but here it is through
a computer you know

810
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
a computer you know
 

811
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,069
a computer you know
i'll just think it and it comes through

812
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
i'll just think it and it comes through
 

813
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,829
i'll just think it and it comes through
and you know like all these things

814
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
and you know like all these things
 

815
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,150
and you know like all these things
i think it's awesome it could be i think

816
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
i think it's awesome it could be i think
 

817
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,910
i think it's awesome it could be i think
i mean coma

818
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
i mean coma
 

819
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,509
i mean coma
sure someone who's in a coma comes to

820
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
sure someone who's in a coma comes to
 

821
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,470
sure someone who's in a coma comes to
mind he's like can that really be

822
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
mind he's like can that really be
 

823
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,550
mind he's like can that really be
possible to be able to like it's just

824
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
possible to be able to like it's just
