79
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,890

scale 2 times a day and I'm watching the

80
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:03,900
scale 2 times a day and I'm watching the
 

81
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,780
scale 2 times a day and I'm watching the
trends and I am noticing of course I'm

82
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:05,790
trends and I am noticing of course I'm
 

83
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,010

85
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,540
heavier at night than I am in the
morning so let's just split the

00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:08,550
morning so let's just split the
 

87
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,850
morning so let's just split the
difference actually no let's not take

88
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:10,860
difference actually no let's not take
 

89
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,500
difference actually no let's not take
the average let's take the morning wait

graphic projects quite often I request a
 

417
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,920
graphic projects quite often I request a
vector image from my client and the

418
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:45,930
vector image from my client and the
 

419

what the heck is a vector image right so
 

425
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,940
what the heck is a vector image right so
so maybe that's the question I have to

426
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:55,950
so maybe that's the question I have to
 

427
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,120
so maybe that's the question I have to
answer first so a raster image or a

428
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,130
answer first so a raster image or a
 

429
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,640
answer first so a raster image or a
flattened image like a JPEG or a

430
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,650
flattened image like a JPEG or a
 

431
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,660
flattened image like a JPEG or a
painting or bitmap is it's what's called

432
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:05,670
painting or bitmap is it's what's called
 

433
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,590
painting or bitmap is it's what's called
a rasterized image so that image is set

434
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
a rasterized image so that image is set
 

435
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,550
a rasterized image so that image is set
to the dimensions that the Creator had

436
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:13,560
to the dimensions that the Creator had
 

437
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,570
to the dimensions that the Creator had
saved it as so let's say a video is 1920

438
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:17,580
saved it as so let's say a video is 1920
 

439
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,700
saved it as so let's say a video is 1920
by 1080 so if you have a screenshot from

440
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,710
by 1080 so if you have a screenshot from
 

441
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,830
by 1080 so if you have a screenshot from
that video that screen shot is going to

442
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:21,840
that video that screen shot is going to
 

443
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,040
that video that screen shot is going to
be 1920 by 1080 now you can scale that

444
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,050
be 1920 by 1080 now you can scale that
 

445
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,370
be 1920 by 1080 now you can scale that
down and it's gonna look great you can

446
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,380
down and it's gonna look great you can
 

447
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,980
down and it's gonna look great you can
shrink it and it's gonna look fantastic

448
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:29,990
shrink it and it's gonna look fantastic
 

449
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,170
shrink it and it's gonna look fantastic
however if you ever tried to make it

450
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,180
however if you ever tried to make it
 

451
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,150
however if you ever tried to make it
bigger so let's say you wanted to fit it

452
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,160
bigger so let's say you wanted to fit it
 

453
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,740
bigger so let's say you wanted to fit it
on a 4k screen

454
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:36,750
on a 4k screen
 

455
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,600
on a 4k screen
well now what you're doing is you're

456
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:38,610
well now what you're doing is you're
 

457
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,240
well now what you're doing is you're
taking that 1080 piece screenshot and

458
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,250
taking that 1080 piece screenshot and
 

459
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,870
taking that 1080 piece screenshot and
you're stretching it and well how does a

460
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
you're stretching it and well how does a
 

461
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,790
you're stretching it and well how does a
computer stretch an image well it

462
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
computer stretch an image well it
 

463
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
computer stretch an image well it
recreates all the pixels it stretches

464
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:49,530
recreates all the pixels it stretches
 

465
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,640
recreates all the pixels it stretches
them and each pixel is stretched so

466
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:52,650
them and each pixel is stretched so
 

467
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,130
them and each pixel is stretched so
eventually when you get big enough

468
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,140
eventually when you get big enough
 

469
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,110
eventually when you get big enough
you're gonna get distortion you're gonna

470
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
you're gonna get distortion you're gonna
 

471
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,780
you're gonna get distortion you're gonna
get blurriness and this happens when you

472
00:09:59,780 --> 00:09:59,790
get blurriness and this happens when you
 

473
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,990
get blurriness and this happens when you
take a logo it's a perfect example when

474
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,000
take a logo it's a perfect example when
 

475
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,270
take a logo it's a perfect example when
you take a little logo from a website

476
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,280
you take a little logo from a website
 

477
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,420
you take a little logo from a website
and you try to print it on a billboard

478
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,430
and you try to print it on a billboard
 

479
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,950
and you try to print it on a billboard
well that's not gonna look good and

480
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:09,960
well that's not gonna look good and
 

481
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,750
well that's not gonna look good and
somebody with some quality control is

482
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
somebody with some quality control is
 

483
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,360
somebody with some quality control is
gonna tell you don't do that we need a

484
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,370
gonna tell you don't do that we need a
 

485
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,670
gonna tell you don't do that we need a
vector image well what is the vector

486
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
vector image well what is the vector
 

487
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,290
vector image well what is the vector
image how can I get a vector image I

488
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,300
image how can I get a vector image I
 

489
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,990
image how can I get a vector image I
don't have one okay so then myself as a

490
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
don't have one okay so then myself as a
 

491
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,740
don't have one okay so then myself as a
graphic eye I'm not a graphic designer

492
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:27,750
graphic eye I'm not a graphic designer
 

493
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,810
graphic eye I'm not a graphic designer
but I'll use that term loosely in that

494
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:29,820
but I'll use that term loosely in that
 

495
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,760
but I'll use that term loosely in that
I'll take your graphics and I'll be

496
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:31,770
I'll take your graphics and I'll be
 

497
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,170
I'll take your graphics and I'll be
quality control and I'll make sure that

498
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,180
quality control and I'll make sure that
 

499
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,530
quality control and I'll make sure that
it's ready for you for your billboard

500
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:35,540
it's ready for you for your billboard
 

501
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,350
it's ready for you for your billboard
what can I do to help a lot of times you

502
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
what can I do to help a lot of times you
 

503
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,770
what can I do to help a lot of times you
have access to those graphics as raster

504
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:42,780
have access to those graphics as raster
 

505
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,100
have access to those graphics as raster
images but they're not vector so again

506
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,110
images but they're not vector so again
 

507
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,490
images but they're not vector so again
it's a logo if I scale it up if I make

508
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:49,500
it's a logo if I scale it up if I make
 

509
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,050
it's a logo if I scale it up if I make
that little logo that's meant for a

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,060
that little logo that's meant for a
 

511
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,730
that little logo that's meant for a
website and scale it up to a billboard

512
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:52,740
website and scale it up to a billboard
 

513
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,130
website and scale it up to a billboard
it's gonna get all grainy it's gonna get

514
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,140
it's gonna get all grainy it's gonna get
 

515
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,260
it's gonna get all grainy it's gonna get
blurry it's gonna get those like blocky

516
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,270
blurry it's gonna get those like blocky
 

517
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,810
blurry it's gonna get those like blocky
pixels it's gonna look terrible in the

00:10:59,810 --> 00:10:59,820
pixels it's gonna look terrible in the
 

519
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,940
pixels it's gonna look terrible in the
end so you want to avoid that at all

that directs well here's a curve okay so
 

533
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,570

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,260
that's what vector is it's gonna allow
you to scale it up and the curve is

gonna stay the same that the image is
 

545
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,760
gonna stay the same that the image is
gonna look just as good if you print it

gonna look just as good if you print it

don't know if such a thing exists but if

550
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,330
don't know if such a thing exists but if
 

551
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,510
don't know if such a thing exists but if
it does you could print it with a vector

552
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:43,520
it does you could print it with a vector
 

553
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,460
it does you could print it with a vector
if you took a raster image and did that

00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,470
if you took a raster image and did that

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,790
if you took a raster image and did that
it would be horrible but it often comes

556
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
it would be horrible but it often comes
 

557
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,490
it would be horrible but it often comes
up in my industry and and perhaps you've

558
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:51,500
up in my industry and and perhaps you've
 

559
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,780
up in my industry and and perhaps you've
encountered this where it's like I don't

560
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:52,790
encountered this where it's like I don't
 

561
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,210
encountered this where it's like I don't
have a vector so what am I gonna do so

562
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,220
have a vector so what am I gonna do so
 

563
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,550
have a vector so what am I gonna do so
today we're looking at how to use Linux

564
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:57,560
today we're looking at how to use Linux
 

565
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,410
today we're looking at how to use Linux
and free software in order to convert a

566
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:01,420
and free software in order to convert a
 

567
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,440
and free software in order to convert a
raster image into a vector now there are

568
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,450
raster image into a vector now there are
 

569
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,150
raster image into a vector now there are
online tools that allow you to do this

570
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,160
online tools that allow you to do this
 

571
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,530
online tools that allow you to do this
that's cool

572
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:08,540
that's cool
 

573
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,180
that's cool
but if you ever look at the source code

574
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,190
but if you ever look at the source code
 

575
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,370
but if you ever look at the source code
you're gonna realize that those online

576
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:12,380
you're gonna realize that those online
 

577
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,950
you're gonna realize that those online
tools that do this for free all they're

578
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:14,960
tools that do this for free all they're
 

579
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,170
tools that do this for free all they're
doing is and quite often not not

580
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,180
doing is and quite often not not
 

581
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,240
doing is and quite often not not
necessarily all they always and it's not

582
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,250
necessarily all they always and it's not
 

583
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,090
necessarily all they always and it's not
always the case but quite often those

584
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,100
always the case but quite often those
 

585
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,960
always the case but quite often those
free tools are taking that raster image

586
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:25,970
free tools are taking that raster image
 

587
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,880
free tools are taking that raster image
and they're putting it in a vector and

588
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:27,890
and they're putting it in a vector and
 

589
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,670
and they're putting it in a vector and
then they're embedding the raster image

590
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:30,680
then they're embedding the raster image
 

591
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,420
then they're embedding the raster image
into a vector file so it's still raster

592
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:36,430
into a vector file so it's still raster
 

593
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,620
into a vector file so it's still raster
instead what we want to do is we want to

594
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:38,630
instead what we want to do is we want to
 

595
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,330
instead what we want to do is we want to
take that image and we want to trace

596
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,340
take that image and we want to trace
 

597
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,510
take that image and we want to trace
around all of the curves so if there's a

598
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:43,520
around all of the curves so if there's a
 

599
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,570
around all of the curves so if there's a
letter S I want to trace around that

600
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:46,580
letter S I want to trace around that
 

601
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,670
letter S I want to trace around that
letter s so that when I scale it up it's

602
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:48,680
letter s so that when I scale it up it's
 

603
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,480
letter s so that when I scale it up it's
going to look absolutely perfect well

604
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,490
going to look absolutely perfect well
 

605
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,130
going to look absolutely perfect well
how do I do that that sounds like a lot

606
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,140
how do I do that that sounds like a lot
 

607
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,230
how do I do that that sounds like a lot
of work because we're thinking in raster

608
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
of work because we're thinking in raster
 

609
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,690
of work because we're thinking in raster
terms right we're thinking in the GNU

610
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:58,700
terms right we're thinking in the GNU
 

611
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,060
terms right we're thinking in the GNU
image manipulation program or Photoshop

612
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,070
image manipulation program or Photoshop
 

613
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,310
image manipulation program or Photoshop
and how we'd have to trace around

614
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:03,320
and how we'd have to trace around
 

615
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,570
and how we'd have to trace around
everything and it would just be

616
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:04,580
everything and it would just be
 

617
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,000
everything and it would just be
absolutely brutal but Linux makes it a

618
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,010
absolutely brutal but Linux makes it a

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,010
absolutely brutal but Linux makes it a
lot easier so let's jump into my

620
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,020
lot easier so let's jump into my
 

621
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,630
lot easier so let's jump into my
terminal I'm going to bring up my

622
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:10,640
terminal I'm going to bring up my
 

623
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,270
terminal I'm going to bring up my
computer here and all we need is a

624
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,280
computer here and all we need is a
 

625
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,460
computer here and all we need is a
simple program

626
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,470
simple program
 

627
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,519
simple program
which I'm going to install first but

628
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:18,529
which I'm going to install first but
 

629
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,319
which I'm going to install first but
then we're gonna grab a logo off of the

630
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:20,329
then we're gonna grab a logo off of the
 

631
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:24,759
then we're gonna grab a logo off of the
web so I'm gonna become root so on Linux

632
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:24,769
web so I'm gonna become root so on Linux
 

633
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:30,309
web so I'm gonna become root so on Linux
Mint its sudo su or su do su for those

634
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:30,319
Mint its sudo su or su do su for those
 

635
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,879
Mint its sudo su or su do su for those
purists and enter your password now that

00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:33,889
purists and enter your password now that
 

637
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,919
purists and enter your password now that
I'm the super user so I'm the root user

638
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:35,929
I'm the super user so I'm the root user
 

639
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:39,309
I'm the super user so I'm the root user
now I can type apt update and that's

640
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:39,319
now I can type apt update and that's
 

641
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,290
now I can type apt update and that's
gonna grab my latest repository

642
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:41,300
gonna grab my latest repository
 

643
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,480
gonna grab my latest repository
information from the web so these are

644
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:43,490
information from the web so these are
 

645
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,239

00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,699
the online available Linux applications
and I'm gonna go apt install and there's

648
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:48,709
and I'm gonna go apt install and there's
 

649
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:53,489
and I'm gonna go apt install and there's
a really simple command here p.o trace

650
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:53,499
a really simple command here p.o trace
 

651
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,259
a really simple command here p.o trace
that's gonna grab a program called I

652
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:56,269
that's gonna grab a program called I
 

653
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,929
that's gonna grab a program called I
don't know if it's called Poe trace or

really tiny I don't know how well that's
 

685
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,340
really tiny I don't know how well that's
gonna scale you probably you know that

686
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,350
gonna scale you probably you know that
 

687
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,819
gonna scale you probably you know that
makes me think about the initial quality

688
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:42,829
makes me think about the initial quality
 

689
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,889
makes me think about the initial quality
control as we're doing this we want to

690
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:44,899
control as we're doing this we want to
 

691
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,040
control as we're doing this we want to
try to get the biggest image we can we

692
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,050
try to get the biggest image we can we
 

693
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,169
try to get the biggest image we can we
want to try to get it as something that

694
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:50,179
want to try to get it as something that
 

695
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,059
want to try to get it as something that
has an alpha layer like a ping for

696
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:52,069
has an alpha layer like a ping for
 

697
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:54,910
has an alpha layer like a ping for
example that would be perfect and we

698
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:54,920
example that would be perfect and we
 

699
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,860
example that would be perfect and we
want to make sure that it's as clear as

00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:56,870
want to make sure that it's as clear as
 

701
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,379
want to make sure that it's as clear as
possible if it's got dithered edges or a

00:14:59,379 --> 00:14:59,389
possible if it's got dithered edges or a
 

703
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,410
possible if it's got dithered edges or a
drop shadow behind it it's not going to

704
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:02,420
drop shadow behind it it's not going to
 

705
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,919
drop shadow behind it it's not going to
render well as a vector because vectors

706
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:05,929
render well as a vector because vectors
 

707
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,350
render well as a vector because vectors
are completely different than a raster

708
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,360
are completely different than a raster
 

709
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
are completely different than a raster
image they're not colorized

710
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,370
image they're not colorized
 

711
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,840
image they're not colorized
but they can be colorized on the like

712
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:13,850
but they can be colorized on the like
 

713
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,850
but they can be colorized on the like
when you display them so you can say

714
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:15,860
when you display them so you can say
 

715
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,739
when you display them so you can say
okay well that part is going to be this

716
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:17,749
okay well that part is going to be this
 

717
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,239
okay well that part is going to be this
Pantone and that part is going to be

718
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:19,249
Pantone and that part is going to be
 

719
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:21,340
Pantone and that part is going to be
this Pantone but it's a lot different

720
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,350
this Pantone but it's a lot different
 

721
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,379
this Pantone but it's a lot different
because it's not saving it as the same

722
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:23,389
because it's not saving it as the same
 

723
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,160
because it's not saving it as the same
raster

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,590
TV network logo that you see there on my
screen is I might want to do something

732
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:32,600
screen is I might want to do something
 

733
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,379
screen is I might want to do something
like grab the master image that one

734
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:35,389
like grab the master image that one
 

735
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,910
like grab the master image that one
looks like it's got some drop shadowing

736
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:36,920
looks like it's got some drop shadowing
 

737
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,189
looks like it's got some drop shadowing
going and I could probably go to wiki

738
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
going and I could probably go to wiki
 

739
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,079
going and I could probably go to wiki
dot category-five dot TV and on my wiki

740
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,089
dot category-five dot TV and on my wiki
 

741
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,679
dot category-five dot TV and on my wiki
I could find branding and go to the

742
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:47,689
I could find branding and go to the
 

743
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:50,710
I could find branding and go to the
category 5 branding and I can grab one

744
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
category 5 branding and I can grab one
 

745
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,400
category 5 branding and I can grab one
of these full-scale images so maybe

746
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,410
of these full-scale images so maybe
 

747
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,230
of these full-scale images so maybe
something a little more like this would

748
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
something a little more like this would
 

749
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,299
something a little more like this would
be to my liking so at the bottom here

750
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:58,309
be to my liking so at the bottom here
 

751
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:01,689
be to my liking so at the bottom here
I've got a word mark file and you can do

752
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:01,699
I've got a word mark file and you can do
 

753
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,879
I've got a word mark file and you can do
that by you know even just getting onto

754
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:03,889
that by you know even just getting onto
 

755
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:06,460
that by you know even just getting onto
Google Images or something and finding a

756
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,470
Google Images or something and finding a
 

757
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,679
Google Images or something and finding a
larger image for the images that you're

758
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:08,689
larger image for the images that you're
 

759
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,019
larger image for the images that you're
looking for so something like that will

760
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:11,029
looking for so something like that will
 

761
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,400
looking for so something like that will
look pretty good but notice that this is

762
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:12,410
look pretty good but notice that this is
 

763
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,889
look pretty good but notice that this is
actually a ping file yeah it scales well

764
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:14,899
actually a ping file yeah it scales well
 

765
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:18,280
actually a ping file yeah it scales well
but it's a ping so let's save it I'm

766
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,290
but it's a ping so let's save it I'm
 

767
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,929
but it's a ping so let's save it I'm
going to throw that on my desktop and

768
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:19,939
going to throw that on my desktop and
 

769
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,629
going to throw that on my desktop and
it's called word mark underscore light

770
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
it's called word mark underscore light
 

771
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,509
it's called word mark underscore light
dot ping so you can see it right there

772

dot ping so you can see it right there
 

773
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,840
dot ping so you can see it right there
so there it is so it's a raster image

774
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:28,850
so there it is so it's a raster image
 

775
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,749
so there it is so it's a raster image

if you've got something else like let's
 

785
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:47,499
if you've got something else like let's
go on to Google Images and just do a

786
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:47,509
go on to Google Images and just do a
 

787
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,269
go on to Google Images and just do a
quick search for I'm gonna do a search

quick search for I'm gonna do a search
 

789
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,819
quick search for I'm gonna do a search
for logo and let's see what we can come

790
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:51,829
for logo and let's see what we can come
 

791
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:55,749
for logo and let's see what we can come
up with all right we got Burger King we

the IKEA logo we have no rights to use
 

797
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,699
the IKEA logo we have no rights to use
that but this is for the sake of the

that but this is for the sake of the
demonstration so fair use says hey we're

800
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
demonstration so fair use says hey we're
 

801
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,250
demonstration so fair use says hey we're
showing you how to do this there we go

802
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,260
showing you how to do this there we go
 

803
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,779
showing you how to do this there we go
so we've got two logos on my desktop

804
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:10,789
so we've got two logos on my desktop
 

805
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,419
so we've got two logos on my desktop
we've got the category 5 TV logo and

we've got the category 5 TV logo and
 

807
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,740
we've got the category 5 TV logo and
we've got the IKEA logo sound good so

808
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:16,750
we've got the IKEA logo sound good so
 

809
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,659
we've got the IKEA logo sound good so
with this program installed so I've got

810
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:19,669
with this program installed so I've got
 

811
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,169
with this program installed so I've got
PO trace installed and now I'm gonna go

812
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:23,179
PO trace installed and now I'm gonna go
 

813
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,199
PO trace installed and now I'm gonna go
to my desktop and look at the images

814
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:26,209
to my desktop and look at the images
 

815
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,690
to my desktop and look at the images
that I have there and both of those are

816
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:28,700
that I have there and both of those are
 

817
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,480
that I have there and both of those are
ping images now one of the things with

818
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,490
ping images now one of the things with
 

819
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,610
ping images now one of the things with
PO trace that we need to keep in mind is

820
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:33,620
PO trace that we need to keep in mind is
 

821
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,919
PO trace that we need to keep in mind is
that PO trace only supports bitmap

822
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:35,929
that PO trace only supports bitmap
 

823
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,720
that PO trace only supports bitmap
images so for the sake of the

824
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:37,730
images so for the sake of the
 

825
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,340
images so for the sake of the
demonstration and just for the ease of

826

Linux and that's one way that you can
 

853
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,080
Linux and that's one way that you can
achieve this alright so I'm going to

854
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,090
achieve this alright so I'm going to
 

855
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,260
achieve this alright so I'm going to
export as so I've got the category 5 TV

856
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,270
export as so I've got the category 5 TV
 

857
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,400

so I'm just gonna change the extension B

860
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:24,420
so I'm just gonna change the extension B
 

861
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,530
so I'm just gonna change the extension B
M P and hit enter now it's gonna ask me

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:27,540
M P and hit enter now it's gonna ask me
 

863
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,820
M P and hit enter now it's gonna ask me
a couple of things here it's going to

864
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:28,830
a couple of things here it's going to
 

865
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,420
a couple of things here it's going to
say ok compatibility options let's open

866
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,430
say ok compatibility options let's open
 

867
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,820
say ok compatibility options let's open
that and make sure that this is not

868
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:34,830
that and make sure that this is not
 

869
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,040
that and make sure that this is not
checked do not write color space

870
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,050
checked do not write color space
 

871
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,610
checked do not write color space
information now we absolutely need color

872
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:40,620
information now we absolutely need color
 

873
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,920
information now we absolutely need color
space information that's a requirement

874
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:42,930
space information that's a requirement
 

875
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,160
space information that's a requirement
of po trace in Advanced Options we can

876
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,170
of po trace in Advanced Options we can
 

877
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,640
of po trace in Advanced Options we can
see 16-bit 24-bit and 32-bit the default

878
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:49,650
see 16-bit 24-bit and 32-bit the default
 

879
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,090
see 16-bit 24-bit and 32-bit the default
is 32-bit a RGB that stands for alpha

880
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,100
is 32-bit a RGB that stands for alpha
 

881
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,070
is 32-bit a RGB that stands for alpha
red green blue now we do want RGB but we

882
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
red green blue now we do want RGB but we
 

883
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,850
red green blue now we do want RGB but we
do not want 32-bit because PO trace is

884
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:01,860
do not want 32-bit because PO trace is
 

885
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,080
do not want 32-bit because PO trace is
probably going to have problems with

886
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,090
probably going to have problems with
 

887
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,060
probably going to have problems with
that instead we're gonna go with 24-bit

888
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,070
that instead we're gonna go with 24-bit
 

889
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,690
that instead we're gonna go with 24-bit
RGB so I'm gonna click on that and now

890
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:07,700
RGB so I'm gonna click on that and now
 

891
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,240
RGB so I'm gonna click on that and now
RGB 24-bit is selected and i'm gonna

892
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,250
RGB 24-bit is selected and i'm gonna
 

893
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,020
RGB 24-bit is selected and i'm gonna
click export so now on my desktop i

894
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,030
click export so now on my desktop i
 

895
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,780
click export so now on my desktop i
should have another file here called

896
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:16,790
should have another file here called
 

897
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,750
should have another file here called
word mark light BMP and when i

898
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:20,760
word mark light BMP and when i
 

899
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,570
word mark light BMP and when i
double-click on that it is my logo look

900
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:23,580
double-click on that it is my logo look
 

901
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,050
double-click on that it is my logo look
at that

902
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,060
at that
 

903
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,440
at that
it's still a raster image if i if i

904
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,450
it's still a raster image if i if i
 

905
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,110
it's still a raster image if i if i
scale that too much i'm gonna start

906
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,120
scale that too much i'm gonna start
 

907
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,060
scale that too much i'm gonna start
losing quality i wonder if i can

908
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,070
losing quality i wonder if i can
 

909
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,460
losing quality i wonder if i can
actually show you that you can see that

910
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:34,470
actually show you that you can see that
 

911
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,210
actually show you that you can see that
if i zoom way in do you see those

912
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:38,220
if i zoom way in do you see those
 

913
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,420
if i zoom way in do you see those
pixelated edges see how grainy that is

914
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:41,430
pixelated edges see how grainy that is
 

915
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,240
pixelated edges see how grainy that is
and how blocky that is that's a raster

916
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,250
and how blocky that is that's a raster
 

917
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,160
and how blocky that is that's a raster
image because it saved each and every

918
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,170
image because it saved each and every
 

919
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,670
image because it saved each and every
pixel so instead we're gonna create a

920
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:48,680
pixel so instead we're gonna create a
 

921
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,070
pixel so instead we're gonna create a
vector based on that file remember the

922
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
vector based on that file remember the
 

923
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,680
vector based on that file remember the
first step is that I do need that bitmap

924
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:54,690
first step is that I do need that bitmap
 

925
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,050
first step is that I do need that bitmap
so whether it's a ping source or a JPEG

926
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,060
so whether it's a ping source or a JPEG
 

927
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,720
so whether it's a ping source or a JPEG
or whatever it happens to be you need to

928
00:19:59,720 --> 00:19:59,730
or whatever it happens to be you need to
 

929
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,060
or whatever it happens to be you need to
convert it first to a bitmap and then PO

930
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,070
convert it first to a bitmap and then PO
 

931
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,410
convert it first to a bitmap and then PO
trace will be able to work with it so

932
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:03,420
trace will be able to work with it so
 

933
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,140
trace will be able to work with it so
now I'm going to type PO trace and

934
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,150
now I'm going to type PO trace and
 

935
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,940
now I'm going to type PO trace and
there's a couple of things now you can

936
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:07,950
there's a couple of things now you can
 

937
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,000
there's a couple of things now you can
do - - help to learn more see how this

938
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,010
do - - help to learn more see how this
 

939
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,920
do - - help to learn more see how this
works and what you want to do you can

940
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:12,930
works and what you want to do you can
 

941
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,990
works and what you want to do you can
kind of scroll up here and see what kind

942
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,000
kind of scroll up here and see what kind
 

943
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
kind of scroll up here and see what kind
of options are available to you but I'm

944
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,010
of options are available to you but I'm
 

945
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,770
of options are available to you but I'm
gonna tell you what I think is gonna

946
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:18,780
gonna tell you what I think is gonna
 

947
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,750
gonna tell you what I think is gonna
work just fine for us and we'll see here

948
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:20,760
work just fine for us and we'll see here
 

949
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,730
work just fine for us and we'll see here
live on the air if this is gonna work

950
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:22,740
live on the air if this is gonna work
 

951
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,660
live on the air if this is gonna work
I'm gonna do - s which means I'm gonna

952
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:26,670
I'm gonna do - s which means I'm gonna
 

953
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,650
I'm gonna do - s which means I'm gonna
save this as an SVG vector image then

954
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:30,660
save this as an SVG vector image then
 

955
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,520
save this as an SVG vector image then
I'm gonna say - group and - group is of

956
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,530
I'm gonna say - group and - group is of
 

957
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm gonna say - group and - group is of
is an SVG option and what that does is

958
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:37,650
is an SVG option and what that does is
 

959
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,970
is an SVG option and what that does is
it groups related paths together so it's

960
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:40,980
it groups related paths together so it's
 

961
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,710
it groups related paths together so it's
gonna merge all those into a single

962
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
gonna merge all those into a single
 

963
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,790
gonna merge all those into a single
basically a vector like traversal point

964
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:49,800
basically a vector like traversal point
 

965
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,740
basically a vector like traversal point
I don't know the technical terms but

966
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:51,750
I don't know the technical terms but
 

967
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,050
I don't know the technical terms but
rather than having a whole bunch of

968
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,060
rather than having a whole bunch of
 

969
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,060
rather than having a whole bunch of
separate things in your SVG file it's

970
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,070
separate things in your SVG file it's
 

971
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,920
separate things in your SVG file it's
gonna merge those together so let's

972
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:57,930
gonna merge those together so let's
 

973
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,330
gonna merge those together so let's
group those together keep things nice

974
00:20:59,330 --> 00:20:59,340
group those together keep things nice
 

975
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,920
group those together keep things nice
and clean now I want to tell it my

976
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:00,930
and clean now I want to tell it my
 

977
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,070
and clean now I want to tell it my
output I'm gonna call this logo dot SVG

978
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
output I'm gonna call this logo dot SVG
 

979
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,390
output I'm gonna call this logo dot SVG
SVG being a scalable vector format and

980
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
SVG being a scalable vector format and
 

981
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,330
SVG being a scalable vector format and
then the next thing that I can do this

982
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:11,340
then the next thing that I can do this
 

983
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,300
then the next thing that I can do this
is optional but I'm gonna do - - tight

984
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,310
is optional but I'm gonna do - - tight
 

985
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,350
is optional but I'm gonna do - - tight
and what - - tight does is it if there's

986
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:18,360
and what - - tight does is it if there's
 

987
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,450
and what - - tight does is it if there's
a lot of white space around your logo

988
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:20,460
a lot of white space around your logo
 

989
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,770
a lot of white space around your logo
that you're working with it's gonna

990
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:21,780
that you're working with it's gonna
 

991
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,420
that you're working with it's gonna
bring that in it's gonna basically Auto

992
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,430
bring that in it's gonna basically Auto
 

993
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,850
bring that in it's gonna basically Auto
crop that vector for you so that you

994
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:25,860
crop that vector for you so that you
 

995
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,800
crop that vector for you so that you
don't have a bunch of whitespace from a

996
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:27,810
don't have a bunch of whitespace from a
 

997
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,480
don't have a bunch of whitespace from a
vector perspective I think that's a good

998
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,490
vector perspective I think that's a good
 

999
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,230
vector perspective I think that's a good
idea and then the next thing is my input

1000
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,240
idea and then the next thing is my input
 

1001
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,760
idea and then the next thing is my input
file so that file was called word mark

1002
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:36,770
file so that file was called word mark
 

1003
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,300
file so that file was called word mark
light dot BMP now I'm just gonna hit

1004
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,310
light dot BMP now I'm just gonna hit
 

1005
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,540

everything Oh what did I do

1008
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:45,900
everything Oh what did I do
 

1009
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,460
everything Oh what did I do
it says PO trace invalid option - - zero

1010
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:49,470
it says PO trace invalid option - - zero
 

1011
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,360
it says PO trace invalid option - - zero
oh why did I push zero that was supposed

1012
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,370
oh why did I push zero that was supposed
 

1013
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,440
oh why did I push zero that was supposed
to be an O for output there you go so

1014
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,450
to be an O for output there you go so
 

1015
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,830
to be an O for output there you go so
remember - oh not - zero enter and did

1016
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:00,840
remember - oh not - zero enter and did
 

1017

remember - oh not - zero enter and did
you see how quickly that popped up a

1018
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:02,340
you see how quickly that popped up a
 

1019
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,390
you see how quickly that popped up a
logo dot SVG file on my desktop so if I

1020
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,400
logo dot SVG file on my desktop so if I
 

1021
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,610
logo dot SVG file on my desktop so if I
double click on that file now you can

1022
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:07,620
double click on that file now you can
 

1023
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,270
double click on that file now you can
see CAD

1024
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,280
see CAD
 

1025
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,720

five and it's stripped away the green so

1026
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:11,730
five and it's stripped away the green so
 

1027
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,030
five and it's stripped away the green so
that's a problem for me but this is in

1028
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,040
that's a problem for me but this is in
 

1029
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,000
that's a problem for me but this is in
fact a vector so why did it strip away

1030
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,010
fact a vector so why did it strip away
 

1031
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,750
fact a vector so why did it strip away
the green well it's grayscale right so

1032
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:20,760
the green well it's grayscale right so
 

1033
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,240
the green well it's grayscale right so
maybe I can work with that I can look at

1034
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,250
maybe I can work with that I can look at
 

1035
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,830
maybe I can work with that I can look at
the options that are available to me

1036
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
the options that are available to me
 

1037
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,320
the options that are available to me
let's see if gray scaling it would do

1038
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,330
let's see if gray scaling it would do
 

1039
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,150
let's see if gray scaling it would do
some kind of difference so looking at

1040
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,160
some kind of difference so looking at
 

1041
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,600
some kind of difference so looking at
our output options here let's get a

1042
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:32,610
our output options here let's get a
 

1043
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,240
our output options here let's get a
closer look and see what kind of options

1044
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,250
closer look and see what kind of options
 

1045
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,350
closer look and see what kind of options
we have as far as the colorization goes

1046
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,360
we have as far as the colorization goes
 

1047
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,310
we have as far as the colorization goes
we've got resolution scale stretch

1048
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,320
we've got resolution scale stretch
 

1049
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,650
we've got resolution scale stretch

opaque but if you're if you're not sure

1056
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,390
opaque but if you're if you're not sure
 

1057

opaque but if you're if you're not sure
there are ways to do it there are ways

1058
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:58,680
there are ways to do it there are ways
 

1059
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,760
there are ways to do it there are ways
to have it dither for you but there's

1060
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:01,770
to have it dither for you but there's
 

1061
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,020
to have it dither for you but there's
something that we can do here so

1062
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,030
something that we can do here so
 

1063
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,580
something that we can do here so
remember we created that bitmap

1064
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:04,590
remember we created that bitmap
 

1065
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,120
remember we created that bitmap
ourselves right and remember that what a

1066
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,130
ourselves right and remember that what a
 

1067
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,890
ourselves right and remember that what a
victor is is basically the outlines of

1068
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:12,900
victor is is basically the outlines of
 

1069
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,010
victor is is basically the outlines of
this file so let's export that again

1070
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,020
this file so let's export that again
 

1071
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,490
this file so let's export that again
let's create a new export before we do

1072
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:19,500
let's create a new export before we do
 

1073
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,690
let's create a new export before we do
that I'm gonna go image mode grayscale

1074
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:23,700
that I'm gonna go image mode grayscale
 

1075
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,420
that I'm gonna go image mode grayscale
and then image mode RGB again so I've

1076
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,430
and then image mode RGB again so I've
 

1077
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,100
and then image mode RGB again so I've
just gray scaled it let's see if that's

1078
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,110
just gray scaled it let's see if that's
 

1079
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,020
just gray scaled it let's see if that's
gonna do it for us there's still a lot

1080
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,030
gonna do it for us there's still a lot
 

1081
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,340
gonna do it for us there's still a lot
of white there I'm going to overwrite

1082
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,350
of white there I'm going to overwrite
 

1083
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,250
of white there I'm going to overwrite
that file set the same settings I want

1084
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,260
that file set the same settings I want
 

1085
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,810
that file set the same settings I want
to be 24-bit and export that all right

1086
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:44,820
to be 24-bit and export that all right
 

1087
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,280
to be 24-bit and export that all right
I'm just gonna minimize that and see

1088
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,290
I'm just gonna minimize that and see
 

1089
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,950
I'm just gonna minimize that and see
what happens here so let's poet race

1090
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
what happens here so let's poet race
 

1091
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,380
what happens here so let's poet race
that again and see if that's made any

1092
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,390
that again and see if that's made any
 

1093
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,010
that again and see if that's made any
difference and it hasn't so our color is

1094
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,020
difference and it hasn't so our color is
 

1095
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,690
difference and it hasn't so our color is
causing a problem with this particular

1096
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:56,700
causing a problem with this particular
 

1097
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,400
causing a problem with this particular
vector because it's trying to get those

1098
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,410
vector because it's trying to get those
 

1099
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,560
vector because it's trying to get those
edges and it's seen the black but it's

1100
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,570
edges and it's seen the black but it's
 

1101
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,840
edges and it's seen the black but it's
not seeing the green so how can I fix

1102
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:02,850
not seeing the green so how can I fix
 

1103
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,130
not seeing the green so how can I fix
that and it's not seeing the white

1104
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,140
that and it's not seeing the white
 

1105
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,870
that and it's not seeing the white
either it's seeing that as like a

1106
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,880
either it's seeing that as like a
 

1107
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,080
either it's seeing that as like a
background color so back in the GNU

1108
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,090
background color so back in the GNU
 

1109
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,130
background color so back in the GNU
image manipulation program I can turn on

1110
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:12,140
image manipulation program I can turn on
 

1111
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,320
image manipulation program I can turn on
alpha hold so this is locked the Alpha

1112
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,330
alpha hold so this is locked the Alpha
 

1113
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,000
alpha hold so this is locked the Alpha
Channel and then choose black

1114
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,010
Channel and then choose black
 

1115
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,810
Channel and then choose black
and right-click and go edit fill with

1116
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:21,820
and right-click and go edit fill with
 

1117
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,310
and right-click and go edit fill with
foreground color and so I've created

1118
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:23,320
foreground color and so I've created
 

1119
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,220
foreground color and so I've created
that as a completely black image now I

1120
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,230
that as a completely black image now I
 

1121
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,190
that as a completely black image now I
can go file export as word mark light

1122
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
can go file export as word mark light
 

1123
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,880
can go file export as word mark light
dot BMP export and replace set my

1124
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:32,890
dot BMP export and replace set my
 

1125
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,310
dot BMP export and replace set my
settings and export so now I've got an

1126
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
settings and export so now I've got an
 

1127
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,690
settings and export so now I've got an
image that's a bitmap that is all black

1128
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:41,700
image that's a bitmap that is all black
 

1129
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,500
image that's a bitmap that is all black
so now if I run that command again you

1130
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:46,510
so now if I run that command again you
 

1131
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,789
so now if I run that command again you
don't have to be afraid to experiment

1132
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:47,799
don't have to be afraid to experiment
 

1133
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,030
don't have to be afraid to experiment
and try things out that is the actual

1134
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,040
and try things out that is the actual
 

1135
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,210
and try things out that is the actual
vector so this is the logo SVG this is

1136
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:54,220
vector so this is the logo SVG this is
 

1137
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,310
vector so this is the logo SVG this is
the logo dot BMP so with the logo dot

1138
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
the logo dot BMP so with the logo dot
 

1139
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,710
the logo dot BMP so with the logo dot
BMP I'm gonna hit 1 and then I'm gonna

1140
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
BMP I'm gonna hit 1 and then I'm gonna
 

1141
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,850
BMP I'm gonna hit 1 and then I'm gonna
hit + 1 - can i zoom in 1 2 ctrl + 1 2 3

1142
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:05,860
hit + 1 - can i zoom in 1 2 ctrl + 1 2 3
 

1143
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,880
hit + 1 - can i zoom in 1 2 ctrl + 1 2 3
4 5 and then I'm gonna hit I'm going to

1144
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:08,890
4 5 and then I'm gonna hit I'm going to
 

1145
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,220
4 5 and then I'm gonna hit I'm going to
come over here so this is the bitmap you

1146
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,230
come over here so this is the bitmap you
 

1147
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,560
come over here so this is the bitmap you
see those edges how kind of awful those

1148
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:13,570
see those edges how kind of awful those
 

1149
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,930
see those edges how kind of awful those
are 1 2 3 4 5 see that jagged edges

1150
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:18,940
are 1 2 3 4 5 see that jagged edges
 

1151
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,539
are 1 2 3 4 5 see that jagged edges
right so let's do the same thing let's

1152
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:21,549
right so let's do the same thing let's
 

1153
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,570
right so let's do the same thing let's
go back to our SVG file that we've

1154
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:24,580
go back to our SVG file that we've
 

1155
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,380
go back to our SVG file that we've
output and let's zoom into that and

1156
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,390
output and let's zoom into that and
 

1157
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,570
output and let's zoom into that and
let's go zoom in a whole bunch of times

1158
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:30,580
let's go zoom in a whole bunch of times
 

1159
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,930
let's go zoom in a whole bunch of times
and move over here notice the background

1160
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:33,940
and move over here notice the background
 

1161
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,330
and move over here notice the background
has gone to see how clean that edges

1162
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:36,340
has gone to see how clean that edges
 

1163
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
has gone to see how clean that edges
because now we're working with a vector

1164
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,350
because now we're working with a vector
 

1165
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,669
because now we're working with a vector
file I've zoomed in a hundred fifteen

1166
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
file I've zoomed in a hundred fifteen
 

1167
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,980
file I've zoomed in a hundred fifteen
hundred times and you can and it's

1168
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:43,990
hundred times and you can and it's
 

1169
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,200
hundred times and you can and it's
really really hard to scroll because I'm

1170
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,210
really really hard to scroll because I'm
 

1171
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,400
really really hard to scroll because I'm
scaled in so close but now ok I'm zoomed

1172
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,410
scaled in so close but now ok I'm zoomed
 

1173
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,230
scaled in so close but now ok I'm zoomed
in two thousand times which is the

1174
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
in two thousand times which is the
 

1175
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,840
in two thousand times which is the
absolute maximum and you can see that

1176
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:54,850
absolute maximum and you can see that
 

1177
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,930
absolute maximum and you can see that
that Edge has absolutely no jagged edges

1178
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:57,940
that Edge has absolutely no jagged edges
 

1179
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,330
that Edge has absolutely no jagged edges
whatsoever so I can scale that up too no

1180
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:00,340
whatsoever so I can scale that up too no
 

1181
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,690
whatsoever so I can scale that up too no
matter what I want it to be and it's not

1182
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:03,700
matter what I want it to be and it's not
 

1183
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,669
matter what I want it to be and it's not
going to be jagged edge if I open that

1184
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
going to be jagged edge if I open that
 

1185
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,350
going to be jagged edge if I open that
with the GNU image manipulation program

1186
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
with the GNU image manipulation program
 

1187
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,230
with the GNU image manipulation program
now it's an SVG file so what is it

1188
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
now it's an SVG file so what is it
 

1189
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,049
now it's an SVG file so what is it
saying hey this is a render scalable

1190
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:13,059
saying hey this is a render scalable
 

1191
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:16,140
saying hey this is a render scalable
vector graphic this is the width and

1192
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,150
vector graphic this is the width and
 

1193
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,990
vector graphic this is the width and
height and what do you want to do well

1194
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,000
height and what do you want to do well
 

1195
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
height and what do you want to do well
let's make it a ridiculous amount let's

1196
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,010
let's make it a ridiculous amount let's
 

1197
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,140
let's make it a ridiculous amount let's
make it thirty thousand pixels wide you

1198
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,150
make it thirty thousand pixels wide you
 

1199
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,640
make it thirty thousand pixels wide you
think this is gonna crash my computer

1200
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:26,650
think this is gonna crash my computer
 

1201
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,860
think this is gonna crash my computer
let's hit OK it might crash

1202
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:29,870
let's hit OK it might crash
 

1203
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,720
let's hit OK it might crash
my computer that's ridiculously high-res

1204
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:33,730
my computer that's ridiculously high-res
 

1205
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,290
my computer that's ridiculously high-res
there we go

1206
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:35,300
there we go
 

1207
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,220
there we go
I'm gonna view it at one times and look

1208
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,230
I'm gonna view it at one times and look
 

1209
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,430
I'm gonna view it at one times and look
at that see those edges that is actually

1210
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:42,440
at that see those edges that is actually
 

1211
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,250
at that see those edges that is actually
one of the letters in our logo they're

1212
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:45,260
one of the letters in our logo they're
 

1213
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,640
one of the letters in our logo they're
absolutely perfect no jagged edge

1214
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:48,650
absolutely perfect no jagged edge
 

1215
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,310
absolutely perfect no jagged edge
because this is legitimately a vector

1216
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:51,320
because this is legitimately a vector
 

1217
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,650
because this is legitimately a vector
and I mentioned there that some of these

1218
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:53,660
and I mentioned there that some of these
 

1219
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,770
and I mentioned there that some of these
online tools that do this for free are

1220
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:55,780
online tools that do this for free are
 

1221
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,299
online tools that do this for free are
gonna cause you to have like a

1222
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:58,309
gonna cause you to have like a
 

1223
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,120
gonna cause you to have like a
rasterized image within a vector that's

1224
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,130
rasterized image within a vector that's
 

1225
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,430
rasterized image within a vector that's
not gonna scale up like that so let's

1226
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
not gonna scale up like that so let's
 

1227
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,169
not gonna scale up like that so let's
actually see how we can determine that

1228
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:05,179
actually see how we can determine that
 

1229
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:07,510
actually see how we can determine that
so if I open with and let's actually

1230
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
so if I open with and let's actually
 

1231
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,060
so if I open with and let's actually
open our SVG file with a text editor and

1232
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,070
open our SVG file with a text editor and
 

1233
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:15,790
open our SVG file with a text editor and
I can see that those SVG paths have been

1234
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:15,800
I can see that those SVG paths have been
 

1235
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,419
I can see that those SVG paths have been
traced by PO trace so these are actually

1236
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:19,429
traced by PO trace so these are actually
 

1237
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,560
traced by PO trace so these are actually
the paths of the vector now what you'll

1238
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:23,570
the paths of the vector now what you'll
 

1239
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,410
the paths of the vector now what you'll
see if it's not vector if it's just like

1240
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:26,420
see if it's not vector if it's just like
 

1241
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,840
see if it's not vector if it's just like
a fake vector is that you'll see that it

1242
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:28,850
a fake vector is that you'll see that it
 

1243
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,110
a fake vector is that you'll see that it
has like an embed with like some pain

1244
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,120
has like an embed with like some pain
 

1245
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,440
has like an embed with like some pain
data well this is a true vector so there

1246
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:35,450
data well this is a true vector so there
 

1247
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,160
data well this is a true vector so there
you have it

1248
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,170
you have it
 

1249
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,190
you have it
and I mentioned about this IKEA logo so

1250
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
and I mentioned about this IKEA logo so
 

1251
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,600
and I mentioned about this IKEA logo so
let's actually see what happens here

1252
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:40,610
let's actually see what happens here
 

1253
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,460
let's actually see what happens here
with the IKEA logo because I want to see

1254
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:42,470
with the IKEA logo because I want to see
 

1255
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,680
with the IKEA logo because I want to see
I want you to know that this is not

1256
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:44,690
I want you to know that this is not
 

1257
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,500
I want you to know that this is not
something that I'm just pretending I'm

1258
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:47,510
something that I'm just pretending I'm
 

1259
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,380
something that I'm just pretending I'm
gonna export that one and I'm gonna save

1260
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:50,390
gonna export that one and I'm gonna save
 

1261
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,150
gonna export that one and I'm gonna save
that on my desktop as dot what dot BMP

1262
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,160
that on my desktop as dot what dot BMP
 

1263
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,460

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,240
me do that well why is that okay
 

1273
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,010

something wrong here if we cancel out

1274
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,020
something wrong here if we cancel out
 

1275
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,180
something wrong here if we cancel out
one of the things I can see about this

1276
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,190
one of the things I can see about this
 

1277
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,240
one of the things I can see about this
image is that this particular image is

1278
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,250
image is that this particular image is
 

1279
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,980
image is that this particular image is
indexed color do you remember back when

1280
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:17,990
indexed color do you remember back when
 

1281
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,930
indexed color do you remember back when
I was working on the category 5 logo I

1282
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:19,940
I was working on the category 5 logo I
 

1283
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,570
I was working on the category 5 logo I
had to switch back to RGB well if I

1284
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:22,580
had to switch back to RGB well if I
 

1285
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,160
had to switch back to RGB well if I
right-click on the image and go image

1286
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,170
right-click on the image and go image
 

1287
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,610
right-click on the image and go image
mode you can see that it is selected as

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:27,620
mode you can see that it is selected as
 

1289
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,750
mode you can see that it is selected as
indexed let's change that to RGB now

1290
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
indexed let's change that to RGB now
 

1291
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,120
indexed let's change that to RGB now
that it's RGB I can export as a bitmap

1292
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,130
that it's RGB I can export as a bitmap
 

1293
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,260
that it's RGB I can export as a bitmap
so export as change it to BMP

1294
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,270
so export as change it to BMP
 

1295
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,370
so export as change it to BMP
and now look at that I've got my

1296
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:42,380
and now look at that I've got my
 

1297
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,740
and now look at that I've got my
Advanced Options back and I can click on

1298
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:44,750
Advanced Options back and I can click on
 

1299
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,630
Advanced Options back and I can click on
24 bits which was the default for this

1300
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
24 bits which was the default for this
 

1301
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,490
24 bits which was the default for this
logo make sure that the color space

1302
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:48,500
logo make sure that the color space
 

1303
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,950
logo make sure that the color space
information is saved and hit export so

1304
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
information is saved and hit export so
 

1305
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,370
information is saved and hit export so
now on my desktop I've got a nice little

1306
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:54,380
now on my desktop I've got a nice little
 

1307
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,130
now on my desktop I've got a nice little
image file a duplicate it looks like a

1308
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:57,140
image file a duplicate it looks like a
 

1309
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,650
image file a duplicate it looks like a
duplicate but this one is a bitmap so

1310
00:28:59,650 --> 00:28:59,660
duplicate but this one is a bitmap so
 

1311
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,310
duplicate but this one is a bitmap so
now back in my terminal let's try that

1312
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:03,320
now back in my terminal let's try that
 

1313
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,750
now back in my terminal let's try that
one so I'm just gonna press the up arrow

1314
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:04,760
one so I'm just gonna press the up arrow
 

1315
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,110
one so I'm just gonna press the up arrow
on my Linux keyboard and remove the

1316
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,120
on my Linux keyboard and remove the
 

1317
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,600
on my Linux keyboard and remove the
source image from the last command and

1318
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,610
source image from the last command and
 

1319
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,270
source image from the last command and
instead change that to IKEA underscore

1320
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,280
instead change that to IKEA underscore
 

1321
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,540
instead change that to IKEA underscore
2019 logo dot BMP and hit enter and

1322
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:16,550
2019 logo dot BMP and hit enter and
 

1323
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,500
2019 logo dot BMP and hit enter and
instantly I see a new IKEA oh no it

1324
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:20,510
instantly I see a new IKEA oh no it
 

1325
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,570
instantly I see a new IKEA oh no it
saved as logo SVG because of the - OH

1326
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:22,580
saved as logo SVG because of the - OH
 

1327
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,220
saved as logo SVG because of the - OH
command let's see what that looks like

1328
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,230
command let's see what that looks like
 

1329
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,230
command let's see what that looks like
tada

1330
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,240
tada
 

1331
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,160
tada
so that's a vector of the IKEA logo well

1332
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,170
so that's a vector of the IKEA logo well
 

1333
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,260
so that's a vector of the IKEA logo well
that's not exactly what I would want

1334
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,270
that's not exactly what I would want
 

1335
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,690
that's not exactly what I would want
remember vector is not saving the color

1336
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:34,700
remember vector is not saving the color
 

1337
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,210
remember vector is not saving the color
information it's saving the paths right

1338
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:37,220
information it's saving the paths right
 

1339
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,320
information it's saving the paths right
the color information is going to be

1340
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,330
the color information is going to be
 

1341
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,580
the color information is going to be
separate that's something that you're

1342
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:39,590
separate that's something that you're
 

1343
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,320
separate that's something that you're
gonna provide to your graphic designer

1344
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,330
gonna provide to your graphic designer
 

1345
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,600
gonna provide to your graphic designer
or maybe your logo doesn't have a whole

1346
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:43,610
or maybe your logo doesn't have a whole
 

1347
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,390
or maybe your logo doesn't have a whole
lot but watch this so if I do that

1348
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:46,400
lot but watch this so if I do that
 

1349
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,220
lot but watch this so if I do that
command again now I'm gonna add to that

1350
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,230
command again now I'm gonna add to that
 

1351
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,450
command again now I'm gonna add to that
command I don't know if I can do it at

1352
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:49,460
command I don't know if I can do it at
 

1353
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,760
command I don't know if I can do it at
the end but I'm gonna type - - invert

1354
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:51,770
the end but I'm gonna type - - invert
 

1355
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:55,780
the end but I'm gonna type - - invert
and now that I've typed - - invert and I

1356
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:55,790
and now that I've typed - - invert and I
 

1357
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,100
and now that I've typed - - invert and I
open that image again look at the

1358
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,110
open that image again look at the
 

1359
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,470
open that image again look at the
difference it's inverted that logo for

1360
00:29:59,470 --> 00:29:59,480
difference it's inverted that logo for
 

1361
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,320
difference it's inverted that logo for
me and now I have a perfect vector that

1362
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,330
me and now I have a perfect vector that
 

1363
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,990
me and now I have a perfect vector that
looks like that so again if I open that

1364
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,000
looks like that so again if I open that
 

1365
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,150
looks like that so again if I open that
in the GNU image manipulation program

1366
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,160
in the GNU image manipulation program
 

1367
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,340
in the GNU image manipulation program
and I'm only doing that because this is

1368
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,350
and I'm only doing that because this is
 

1369
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,780
and I'm only doing that because this is
a raster program but I want you to see

1370
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:10,790
a raster program but I want you to see
 

1371
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,660
a raster program but I want you to see
that this is indeed a vector image now

1372
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:13,670
that this is indeed a vector image now
 

1373
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,430
that this is indeed a vector image now
if I take that and I make it fifty

1374
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,440
if I take that and I make it fifty
 

1375
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,160
if I take that and I make it fifty
thousand pixels wide eighteen thousand

1376
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,170

we do that well every device has a MAC

1632
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:23,569
we do that well every device has a MAC
 

1633
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:26,499
we do that well every device has a MAC
address the MAC address is a private

1634
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:26,509
address the MAC address is a private

but it's available on the device and
 

1639
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,759
but it's available on the device and
it's available to the DHB DHCP server so

1640
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:33,769
it's available to the DHB DHCP server so
 

1641
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:36,160
it's available to the DHB DHCP server so
your DHCP server that dishes out the IP

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,630
a Linux DHCP server and look at the MAC
address of that device and set up a DHCP

1658
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,640
address of that device and set up a DHCP
 

1659
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,950

1769
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,799
Sascha's dot 5 1 you see Sasha Sasha was
not here Robbie is so Robbie equals 1

1770
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:19,809
not here Robbie is so Robbie equals 1

00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:27,069
Sasha equals 0 1 point 4 Robbie
so now programmatically we can say ok

1774
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:27,079
so now programmatically we can say ok
 

1775
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,440
so now programmatically we can say ok
well we can we can program that we can

1776
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,450
well we can we can program that we can
 

1777
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,180
well we can we can program that we can
change that we can manipulate that to

1778
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,190
change that we can manipulate that to
 

1779
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,539
change that we can manipulate that to
say ok is Robbie online and we can run

1780
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:34,549
say ok is Robbie online and we can run
 

1781
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:36,819
say ok is Robbie online and we can run
that as a cron job right

1782
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:36,829
that as a cron job right
 

1783
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:39,970
that as a cron job right
okay so similarily let's take my smart

1784
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:39,980
okay so similarily let's take my smart
 

1785
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,410
okay so similarily let's take my smart
phone and I'm going to turn off my Wi-Fi

1786
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:41,420
phone and I'm going to turn off my Wi-Fi
 

1787
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,049
phone and I'm going to turn off my Wi-Fi
so now my Wi-Fi is off I'm gonna run

1788
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:44,059
so now my Wi-Fi is off I'm gonna run
 

1789
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:46,029
so now my Wi-Fi is off I'm gonna run
that command again and watch what

1790
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:46,039
that command again and watch what
 

1791
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,569
that command again and watch what
happens you can assume what happens but

1792
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:48,579
happens you can assume what happens but
 

1793
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,609
happens you can assume what happens but
10.0.0.0 which we've already established

1794
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:51,619
10.0.0.0 which we've already established
 

1795
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:55,809
10.0.0.0 which we've already established
as Robbie is going to timeout and it's

1796
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:55,819
as Robbie is going to timeout and it's
 

1797
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,990
as Robbie is going to timeout and it's
gonna say 0 so now we know that both

1798
00:40:58,990 --> 00:40:59,000
gonna say 0 so now we know that both
 

1799
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,170
gonna say 0 so now we know that both
Robbie and Sasha are gone from the

1800
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:02,180
Robbie and Sasha are gone from the
 

1801
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,870
Robbie and Sasha are gone from the
building I've turned on my Wi-Fi and I'm

1802
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
building I've turned on my Wi-Fi and I'm
 

1803
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,760
building I've turned on my Wi-Fi and I'm
gonna run that command again and now we

1804
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:06,770
gonna run that command again and now we
 

1805
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,480
gonna run that command again and now we
can see Robbie's back sash is still not

1806
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,490
can see Robbie's back sash is still not
 

1807
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,180
can see Robbie's back sash is still not
here so what does that do for me so now

1808
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,190
here so what does that do for me so now
 

1809
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,660
here so what does that do for me so now
programmatically I can say let's get an

1810
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:16,670
programmatically I can say let's get an
 

1811

turns on and I know exactly what that is
I'm gonna head over there and open the

1824
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:31,970
I'm gonna head over there and open the
 

1825
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,029
I'm gonna head over there and open the
door no more standing out in the

1826
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:34,039
door no more standing out in the
 

1827
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:37,150
door no more standing out in the
Canadian cold winters and we can do we

1828
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,160
Canadian cold winters and we can do we
 

1829
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,799
Canadian cold winters and we can do we
can program that to be able to log

1830
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:38,809
can program that to be able to log
 

1831
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,109
can program that to be able to log
things to a MySQL database there's no

1832
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
things to a MySQL database there's no
 

1833
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,070
things to a MySQL database there's no
limit

1834
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,080

1835
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080

as long as you've got some creativity

1836
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,090
as long as you've got some creativity
 

1837
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,520
as long as you've got some creativity
and a little know-how you're gonna be

1838
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:45,530
and a little know-how you're gonna be
 

1839
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,380
and a little know-how you're gonna be
able to do this so let's look at that

1840
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,390
able to do this so let's look at that
 

1841
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,330
able to do this so let's look at that
source code and see what it's actually

1842
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:49,340
source code and see what it's actually
 

1843
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,840
source code and see what it's actually
doing so I'm gonna edit Wi-Fi - check

1844
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:52,850
doing so I'm gonna edit Wi-Fi - check
 

1845
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,290
doing so I'm gonna edit Wi-Fi - check
from my get repository so what it's done

1846
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:56,300
from my get repository so what it's done
 

1847
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,330
from my get repository so what it's done
is it's open the file the the config

1848
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:58,340
is it's open the file the the config
 

1849
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,640
is it's open the file the the config
file that I created and it's grabbing

1850
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:00,650
file that I created and it's grabbing
 

1851
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,580
file that I created and it's grabbing
the addresses well they don't have to be

1852
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:03,590
the addresses well they don't have to be
 

1853
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:09,220
the addresses well they don't have to be
I should say they don't have to be IP

1854
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,230
I should say they don't have to be IP
 

1855
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,470
I should say they don't have to be IP
addresses on a local LAN I can put

1856
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:11,480
addresses on a local LAN I can put
 

1857
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,620
addresses on a local LAN I can put
google.ca if I wanted to and then if I

1858
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:14,630
google.ca if I wanted to and then if I
 

1859
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,410
google.ca if I wanted to and then if I
run it it's just so you know so just so

1860
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:17,420
run it it's just so you know so just so
 

1861
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,360
run it it's just so you know so just so
you know the flexibility of this so you

1862
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,370
you know the flexibility of this so you
 

1863
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,690
you know the flexibility of this so you
can see google.ca is online it's

1864
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:22,700
can see google.ca is online it's
 

1865
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,370
can see google.ca is online it's
responding to a ping so I just want you

1866
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:24,380
responding to a ping so I just want you
 

1867
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,260
responding to a ping so I just want you
to know that it has that flexibility

1868
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,270
to know that it has that flexibility
 

1869
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,510
to know that it has that flexibility
okay so you can put anything in there

1870
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:28,520
okay so you can put anything in there
 

1871
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,950
okay so you can put anything in there
that you want as long as it's a valid

1872
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:29,960
that you want as long as it's a valid
 

1873
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,780
that you want as long as it's a valid
hostname a domain name or it could be an

1874
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:34,790
hostname a domain name or it could be an
 

1875
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,850
hostname a domain name or it could be an
IP address as we're using in the

1876
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:36,860
IP address as we're using in the
 

1877
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,370
IP address as we're using in the
demonstration today for this particular

1878
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:39,380
demonstration today for this particular
 

1879
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,730
demonstration today for this particular
use case so then it pings it well that's

1880
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:42,740
use case so then it pings it well that's
 

1881
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,740
use case so then it pings it well that's
all it does it just pings it there it is

1882
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:46,750
all it does it just pings it there it is
 

1883
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,670
all it does it just pings it there it is
ping and it pings the host and if it is

1884
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:51,680
ping and it pings the host and if it is
 

1885
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,280
ping and it pings the host and if it is
up it responds with one and if it's down

1886
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,290
up it responds with one and if it's down
 

1887
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,950
up it responds with one and if it's down
it responds with zero okay well what

1888
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:56,960
it responds with zero okay well what
 

1889
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,600
it responds with zero okay well what
good is that if it responds with one or

1890
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:58,610
good is that if it responds with one or
 

1891
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,880
good is that if it responds with one or
zero you know what what do I do with

1892
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:00,890
zero you know what what do I do with
 

1893
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,240
zero you know what what do I do with
that information Robbie well this is why

1894
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,250
that information Robbie well this is why
 

1895
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,380
that information Robbie well this is why
I wanted to show you the source code

1896
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:05,390
I wanted to show you the source code
 

1897
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,290
I wanted to show you the source code
because you can now say okay well I know

1898
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:08,300
because you can now say okay well I know
 

1899
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,210
because you can now say okay well I know
that it's echoing out 10.0.0.0 equals

1900
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:13,220
that it's echoing out 10.0.0.0 equals
 

1901
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,710
that it's echoing out 10.0.0.0 equals
one why don't we instead wait a minute

1902
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:17,720
one why don't we instead wait a minute
 

1903
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,880
one why don't we instead wait a minute
why don't I delete that line and say

1904
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:20,890
why don't I delete that line and say
 

1905
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,850
why don't I delete that line and say
echo and we're gonna say dollar sign

1906
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:24,860
echo and we're gonna say dollar sign
 

1907
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:32,340
echo and we're gonna say dollar sign
host dot and remember this is PHP is up

1908
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:32,350
host dot and remember this is PHP is up
 

1909
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,330
host dot and remember this is PHP is up
dot PHP EOL

1910
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:35,340
dot PHP EOL
 

1911
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,120
dot PHP EOL
all right and maybe I take this one and

1912
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,130
all right and maybe I take this one and
 

1913
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,610
all right and maybe I take this one and
I say you know what maybe there's no

1914
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:40,620
I say you know what maybe there's no
 

1915
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,060
I say you know what maybe there's no
else maybe I can remove the else and say

1916
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,070
else maybe I can remove the else and say
 

1917
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,580
else maybe I can remove the else and say
it's only gonna tell me if it's up so

1918
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:46,590
it's only gonna tell me if it's up so
 

1919
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,600
it's only gonna tell me if it's up so
now if I run that 10.0.0.0 is up right

1920
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,610
now if I run that 10.0.0.0 is up right
 

1921
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,220
now if I run that 10.0.0.0 is up right
but it doesn't show me the ones that are

1922
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,230
but it doesn't show me the ones that are
 

1923
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,970
but it doesn't show me the ones that are
down or maybe I can take that and I'm

1924
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:55,980
down or maybe I can take that and I'm
 

1925
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,950
down or maybe I can take that and I'm
only showing you that there's no limit

1926
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:57,960
only showing you that there's no limit
 

1927
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,090
only showing you that there's no limit
okay maybe I can say let's just use a

1928
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:02,100
okay maybe I can say let's just use a
 

1929
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,240
okay maybe I can say let's just use a
really simple command if dollar sign

1930
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:05,250
really simple command if dollar sign
 

1931
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,020
really simple command if dollar sign
host equals equals 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 5

1932
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,030
host equals equals 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 5
 

1933
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:25,270
host equals equals 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 5
0 we're gonna say echo Robby's here Oh

1934
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280

 

1935
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,720

boom okay see what I'm doing and then I

1936
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:29,730
boom okay see what I'm doing and then I
 

1937
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,710
boom okay see what I'm doing and then I
can change this to an else

1938
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
can change this to an else
 

1939
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,460
can change this to an else
so if it's not Ravi 10.0.0.0 it's gonna

1940
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:34,470
so if it's not Ravi 10.0.0.0 it's gonna
 

1941
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,890
so if it's not Ravi 10.0.0.0 it's gonna
just echo the host name so now I'm gonna

1942
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:36,900
just echo the host name so now I'm gonna
 

1943
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,320
just echo the host name so now I'm gonna
re add Google to that so you can see cuz

1944
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,330
re add Google to that so you can see cuz
