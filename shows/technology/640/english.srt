00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,810
see that yeah how does yours do blood
pressure well it actually uses a an

64
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:46,820
pressure well it actually uses a an
 

65
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,560
pressure well it actually uses a an
optical sensor it's it shines a green

66
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,570
optical sensor it's it shines a green
 

67
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,680
optical sensor it's it shines a green
light into the veins on my wrist right

68
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,690
light into the veins on my wrist right
 

69
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,630
light into the veins on my wrist right
and then there's a optical sensor that

70
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:55,640
and then there's a optical sensor that
 

71
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
and then there's a optical sensor that
reads that and is somehow able to

72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,010
reads that and is somehow able to
 

73
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:05,649
reads that and is somehow able to
determine yeah it's very very so I'm 127

idea but so they actually replace the

188
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:19,389
idea but so they actually replace the

well sure it was really really good the

194
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,120
well sure it was really really good the
 

195
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,820
well sure it was really really good the
easiest way to do it those you take an

196
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:29,830
easiest way to do it those you take an
 

197
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,100
easiest way to do it those you take an
iceberg lettuce yeah yeah and chop the

198
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,110
iceberg lettuce yeah yeah and chop the
 

199
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,959
iceberg lettuce yeah yeah and chop the
slice off no yeah yeah they slice the

200
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:33,969
slice off no yeah yeah they slice the
 

201
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,029
slice off no yeah yeah they slice the
sides off so that way it has that bun

202
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:36,039
sides off so that way it has that bun
 

203
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,469
sides off so that way it has that bun
shape and yeah put in the middle see

204
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:37,479
shape and yeah put in the middle see
 

205
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,249
shape and yeah put in the middle see
that makes sense

206
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:38,259
that makes sense
 

207
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,010
that makes sense
see they wrapped it and let us so it was

208
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,020
see they wrapped it and let us so it was
 

209
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,200
see they wrapped it and let us so it was
like lettuce leaves wrapped yeah and it

210
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,210

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
a nice taste and I find
 

215
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,320
a nice taste and I find
I'm actually I'm kind of realizing I

216
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,330
I'm actually I'm kind of realizing I
 

217
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,060
I'm actually I'm kind of realizing I

button is like filler yeah and takes
 

221
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,110
button is like filler yeah and takes
away from the taste but as soon as you

222
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
away from the taste but as soon as you
 

223
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,670
away from the taste but as soon as you
wrap it in lettuce it's like you get the

224
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:56,680
wrap it in lettuce it's like you get the
 

225
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,420
wrap it in lettuce it's like you get the
full flavor explosion right and so I

little really really fun way to get
 

397
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,380
little really really fun way to get
physically like just into the game for

398
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,390
physically like just into the game for
 

399
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,780
physically like just into the game for
sure even looking at like the Orville

interactive fan experience like I would
 

403
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,710
interactive fan experience like I would
love in VR to be able to walk through

404

425
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,110
just be sash of being like be amazing so
I mean I've just been using the tech

426
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,120
I mean I've just been using the tech
 

427
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,730
I mean I've just been using the tech
that I have and it's really really

428
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:35,740
that I have and it's really really
 

429
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,710
that I have and it's really really
rudimentary compared to the kind of cool

430
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:37,720
rudimentary compared to the kind of cool
 

431
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,710
rudimentary compared to the kind of cool
stuff that you have but you know it's a

432

749
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,230
we're really it does and when we're

seeing an evolution in malware we're
 

751
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,650

malware to ransomware
 

755
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,409
malware to ransomware
and now even file-this attacks we're

756
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:51,419
and now even file-this attacks we're
 

757
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,949
and now even file-this attacks we're
seeing Hardware attacks and firmware

758
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:53,959
seeing Hardware attacks and firmware
 

759
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,779
seeing Hardware attacks and firmware
infiltrations and things that we've

760
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:56,789
infiltrations and things that we've
 

761
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,969
infiltrations and things that we've
never ever even encountered before but

762

never ever even encountered before but
 

763
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:01,549

will support sales in general between
the Canadian territory so a very

794
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:37,409
the Canadian territory so a very
 

795
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,009
the Canadian territory so a very
technical mind very familiar with the

796
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:40,019
technical mind very familiar with the
 

797
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,810
technical mind very familiar with the
inner workings of the products yep I am

798
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:41,820
inner workings of the products yep I am
 

799
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,149
inner workings of the products yep I am
doing that has all the geeky talk with

800
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:44,159
doing that has all the geeky talk with
 

801
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:45,950
doing that has all the geeky talk with
the other text and reflect customers

802
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:45,960
the other text and reflect customers
 

803
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,039
the other text and reflect customers
yeah and the main driver for that is to

804
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,049
yeah and the main driver for that is to
 

805
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,080
yeah and the main driver for that is to
be able to technically position the

806
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,090
be able to technically position the
 

807
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,909
be able to technically position the
products and see if we can address all

808
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:52,919
products and see if we can address all
 

809
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,159
products and see if we can address all
the customer requirements sure so part

810
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:55,169
the customer requirements sure so part
 

811
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,519
the customer requirements sure so part
of that comes from educating end-users

812
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:58,529
of that comes from educating end-users
 

813
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,009
of that comes from educating end-users
to understand what the cyber security

814
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:01,019
to understand what the cyber security
 

815
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,230
to understand what the cyber security
threat landscape looks like absolutely

816
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,240
threat landscape looks like absolutely
 

817
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,610
threat landscape looks like absolutely
yeah and we've really really seen that

818
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:04,620
yeah and we've really really seen that
 

819
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,080
yeah and we've really really seen that
change over the past couple of years I

820
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,090
change over the past couple of years I
 

821
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,159
change over the past couple of years I
think especially was it 2017 when wanna

822
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:10,169
think especially was it 2017 when wanna
 

823
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,700
think especially was it 2017 when wanna
cry dropped yeah this is like the first

824
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:12,710
cry dropped yeah this is like the first
 

825
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,379
cry dropped yeah this is like the first
ransomware that really made its way

826
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:15,389
ransomware that really made its way
 

827
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:17,180
ransomware that really made its way
around the world and was really really

828
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,190
around the world and was really really
 

829
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,509
around the world and was really really
huge how did that impact the direction

830
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:20,519
huge how did that impact the direction
 

831
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,519
huge how did that impact the direction
of a kind of like you said we should not

832
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:22,529
of a kind of like you said we should not
 

833
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:25,369
of a kind of like you said we should not
see any any numbers going down whenever

834
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:25,379
see any any numbers going down whenever
 

835
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,259
see any any numbers going down whenever
it comes to the ransomware it's still

836
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:27,269
it comes to the ransomware it's still
 

837
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:30,139
it comes to the ransomware it's still
the the really prevalent and and

838
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:30,149
the the really prevalent and and
 

839
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:32,119
the the really prevalent and and
everybody in a way is kind of

840
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:32,129
everybody in a way is kind of
 

841
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:35,360
everybody in a way is kind of
experiencing it we do have a pretty good

842
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,370
experiencing it we do have a pretty good
 

843
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,149
experiencing it we do have a pretty good
protection against it so I I don't

844
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:38,159
protection against it so I I don't
 

845
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,580
protection against it so I I don't
expect my existing customers that are

846
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:40,590
expect my existing customers that are
 

847
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,200
expect my existing customers that are
running updated products and everything

848
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,210
running updated products and everything
 

849
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,980
running updated products and everything
from being acted to those threats but

850
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:45,990
from being acted to those threats but
 

851
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,129
from being acted to those threats but
it's something that's already very very

852
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:48,139
it's something that's already very very
 

853
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:51,080
it's something that's already very very
live very very present in our day-to-day

854
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,090
live very very present in our day-to-day
 

855
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,289
live very very present in our day-to-day
operations something else that right

856
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:54,299
operations something else that right
 

857
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,629
operations something else that right
that I usually highlight on the on the

858
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:56,639
that I usually highlight on the on the
 

859
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,940
that I usually highlight on the on the
threat landscape that we have recently

860
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:58,950
threat landscape that we have recently
 

861
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,770
threat landscape that we have recently
is

862
00:18:59,770 --> 00:18:59,780
is
 

863
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,190
is
the upcoming releases of the file as

864
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
the upcoming releases of the file as
 

865
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,700
the upcoming releases of the file as
malware's so if you have for example an

866
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:06,710
malware's so if you have for example an
 

867
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,370
malware's so if you have for example an
endpoint security product that's running

868
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:09,380
endpoint security product that's running
 

869
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,780
endpoint security product that's running
on your computer either an AV

870
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:10,790
on your computer either an AV
 

871
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,240
on your computer either an AV
anti-malware or whichever name you

872
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,250
anti-malware or whichever name you
 

873
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,160
anti-malware or whichever name you
prefer to call it yeah I still have the

874
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,170
prefer to call it yeah I still have the
 

875
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,250
prefer to call it yeah I still have the
need to scan files so however the idea

876
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,260
need to scan files so however the idea
 

877
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,800
need to scan files so however the idea
of a file is malware is there's no files

878
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:23,810
of a file is malware is there's no files
 

879
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,070
of a file is malware is there's no files
ok so how do you scan something if it's

880
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,080
ok so how do you scan something if it's
 

881
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,050
ok so how do you scan something if it's
it's not available in your computer so

882
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,060
it's not available in your computer so
 

883
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,600
it's not available in your computer so
those those malware's are in general

884
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:31,610
those those malware's are in general
 

885
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,410
those those malware's are in general
being running by script on draw webpages

886
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:35,420
being running by script on draw webpages
 

887
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,890
being running by script on draw webpages
malicious web pages right and the most

888
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:38,900
malicious web pages right and the most
 

889
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,840
malicious web pages right and the most
common one today is probably the quaint

890
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:40,850
common one today is probably the quaint
 

891
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,360
common one today is probably the quaint
miners so it's a script that we run on a

892
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:43,370
miners so it's a script that we run on a
 

893
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,970
miners so it's a script that we run on a
given computer and that computer will

894
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:45,980
given computer and that computer will
 

895
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,700
given computer and that computer will
start mining bitcoins for the for the

896
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:48,710
start mining bitcoins for the for the
 

897
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,910
start mining bitcoins for the for the
malware so you call these file lists

898
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:51,920
malware so you call these file lists
 

899
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,790
malware so you call these file lists
malware so does that mean that it just

900
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:54,800
malware so does that mean that it just
 

901
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,280
malware so does that mean that it just
loads right into RAM from a website yes

902
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,290
loads right into RAM from a website yes
 

903
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,200
loads right into RAM from a website yes
it will actually be it it will be a

904
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,210
it will actually be it it will be a
 

905
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,910
it will actually be it it will be a
script that will be running in memory

906
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:00,920
script that will be running in memory
 

907
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,360
script that will be running in memory
whenever you go to those websites and if

908
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,370
whenever you go to those websites and if
 

909
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,790
whenever you go to those websites and if
your existing endpoint security product

910
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:06,800
your existing endpoint security product
 

911
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,220
your existing endpoint security product
cannot scan or cannot protect your

912
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,230
cannot scan or cannot protect your
 

913
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,220
cannot scan or cannot protect your
memory in real time you will be subset

914
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,230
memory in real time you will be subset
 

915
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,530
memory in real time you will be subset
susceptible to that kind of threat in

916
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:14,540
susceptible to that kind of threat in
 

917
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,000
susceptible to that kind of threat in
general so sounds to me like another

918
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,010
general so sounds to me like another
 

919
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,130
general so sounds to me like another
like wanna cry as the first kind of

920
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,140
like wanna cry as the first kind of
 

921
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,350
like wanna cry as the first kind of
example of ransomware another threat

922
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,360
example of ransomware another threat
 

923
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,500
example of ransomware another threat
where basic like antivirus and you use

924
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,510
where basic like antivirus and you use
 

925
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,410
where basic like antivirus and you use
the absolutely virus because your

926
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:25,420
the absolutely virus because your
 

927
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,030
the absolutely virus because your
anti-malware is a term that we in the

928
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,040
anti-malware is a term that we in the
 

929
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,280
anti-malware is a term that we in the
industry use these days because really

930
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,290
industry use these days because really
 

931
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,650
industry use these days because really
it's not just viruses that we're dealing

932
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:32,660
it's not just viruses that we're dealing
 

933
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,450
it's not just viruses that we're dealing
with us threats anymore so so is

934
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,460
with us threats anymore so so is
 

935
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,790
with us threats anymore so so is
antivirus is it sufficient anymore I

936
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:39,800
antivirus is it sufficient anymore I
 

937
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,200
antivirus is it sufficient anymore I
don't believe in C virus has been

938
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,210
don't believe in C virus has been
 

939
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,930
don't believe in C virus has been
sufficient for a long time so not only

940
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:43,940
sufficient for a long time so not only
 

941
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,810
sufficient for a long time so not only
we have the viruses out there we have

942
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:46,820
we have the viruses out there we have
 

943
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,700
we have the viruses out there we have
those files as malware's we have the

944
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:48,710
those files as malware's we have the
 

945
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,570
those files as malware's we have the
crypto actors in general the ransom

946
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:52,580
crypto actors in general the ransom
 

947
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,000
crypto actors in general the ransom
layers we have Trojans we have back

948
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,010
layers we have Trojans we have back
 

949
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,510
layers we have Trojans we have back
doors we have exploits so in general is

950
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:58,520
doors we have exploits so in general is
 

951
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,990
doors we have exploits so in general is
antivirus enough you know is it better

952
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
antivirus enough you know is it better
 

953
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,630
antivirus enough you know is it better
than not having anything yes but if you

954
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
than not having anything yes but if you
 

955
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,880
than not having anything yes but if you
have the option and yes you do have the

have the option and yes you do have the
options sometimes we are talking about

958
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,330
options sometimes we are talking about
 

959
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,110
options sometimes we are talking about
one

960
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
one
 

961
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,730
one
more expensive or something like that

962
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:10,740
more expensive or something like that
 

963
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,150
more expensive or something like that
you can go to a full suite of an

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,160
you can go to a full suite of an
 

965
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,610
you can go to a full suite of an
endpoint security product which will

966
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:16,620
endpoint security product which will
 

967
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,030
endpoint security product which will
provide you a much better protection

977
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,840
pitch that we're trying to say you know
choose ESET endpoint protection advanced

978
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:29,850
choose ESET endpoint protection advanced
 

979
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,090
choose ESET endpoint protection advanced
because it's a sales pitch I want to

product like endpoint protection
 

985
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,580
product like endpoint protection
advanced isn't it that are taking

986
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:40,590
advanced isn't it that are taking
 

987
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,380
advanced isn't it that are taking
protection to the next level for those

988
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,390
protection to the next level for those
 

989
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,870
protection to the next level for those
users so file this attacks yep

990
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
users so file this attacks yep
 

991
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,640
users so file this attacks yep
ransomware attacks like these are

992
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,650
ransomware attacks like these are
 

993
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,190
ransomware attacks like these are
threats that can take businesses and put

994
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
threats that can take businesses and put
 

995
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,020
threats that can take businesses and put
them out of this gifts yep then and

996
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,030
them out of this gifts yep then and
 

997
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,880
them out of this gifts yep then and
bankrupt their owners yeah absolutely

998
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:52,890
bankrupt their owners yeah absolutely
 

999
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,490
bankrupt their owners yeah absolutely
that's the reason saying yeah so what

1000
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:55,500
that's the reason saying yeah so what
 

1001
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,950
that's the reason saying yeah so what
what features so are those more advanced

1002
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:57,960
what features so are those more advanced
 

1003
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,690
what features so are those more advanced
why do I need to pay Morris and yeah

1004
00:21:59,690 --> 00:21:59,700
why do I need to pay Morris and yeah
 

1005
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,370
why do I need to pay Morris and yeah
absolutely

absolutely
 

1007
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,080
absolutely
specifically reset the modules that we

1008
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,090
specifically reset the modules that we
 

1009
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,850
specifically reset the modules that we
add those more advanced features is

1010
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:04,860
add those more advanced features is
 

1011
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,350
add those more advanced features is
called hips which stands for host

1012
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:06,360
called hips which stands for host
 

1013
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,540
called hips which stands for host
intrusion prevention system and that's

1014
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:08,550
intrusion prevention system and that's
 

1015
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,310
intrusion prevention system and that's
where we have the advanced memory

1016
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
where we have the advanced memory
 

1017
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,200
where we have the advanced memory
scanner which is basically protecting

1018
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,210
scanner which is basically protecting
 

1019
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,420
scanner which is basically protecting
your memory in real time the final and

malware we have the exploit blocker so

1024
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,070
malware we have the exploit blocker so
 

1025
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,370
malware we have the exploit blocker so
let's say whenever a new company

1026
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,380
let's say whenever a new company
 

1027
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,920
let's say whenever a new company
releases a publicly available exploit

1028
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:24,930
releases a publicly available exploit
 

1029
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,350
releases a publicly available exploit
for a vulnerability let's say this week

1030
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
for a vulnerability let's say this week
 

1031
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,970
for a vulnerability let's say this week
we actually had a pretty severe

1032
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:28,980
we actually had a pretty severe
 

1033
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,190
we actually had a pretty severe
vulnerability with Microsoft and they

1034
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
vulnerability with Microsoft and they
 

1035
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,230
vulnerability with Microsoft and they
actually release the patch the next day

1036
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,240
actually release the patch the next day
 

1037
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,550
actually release the patch the next day
or something like that

1038
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:34,560
or something like that
 

1039
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,420
or something like that
we will prevent that vulnerability from

1040
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,430
we will prevent that vulnerability from
 

1041
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,600
we will prevent that vulnerability from
being exploited we this is exactly what

1042
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:41,610
being exploited we this is exactly what
 

1043
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,520
being exploited we this is exactly what
he said accomplished with wanna cry

1044
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,530
he said accomplished with wanna cry
 

1045
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,190
he said accomplished with wanna cry
absolutely yes it was eternal it was

1046
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,200
absolutely yes it was eternal it was
 

1047
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,740
absolutely yes it was eternal it was
yeah it was the summer vulnerability and

1048
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:48,750
yeah it was the summer vulnerability and
 

1049
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,720
yeah it was the summer vulnerability and
yes we were able to actually prevent

1050
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:50,730
yes we were able to actually prevent
 

1051
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,520
yes we were able to actually prevent
that vulnerability from being exploited

1052
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,530
that vulnerability from being exploited
 

1053
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,440
that vulnerability from being exploited
in the first place so even though one

1054
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,450
in the first place so even though one
 

1055
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,330
in the first place so even though one
cry had never been discovered before

1056
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:56,340
cry had never been discovered before
 

1057
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,220
cry had never been discovered before
ESET was already proactively protected

1058
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,230
ESET was already proactively protected
 

1059
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,690
ESET was already proactively protected
absolutely and we were actually

1060
00:22:59,690 --> 00:22:59,700
absolutely and we were actually
 

1061
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,870
absolutely and we were actually
providing that kind of fix two weeks

1062
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
providing that kind of fix two weeks
 

1063
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,970
providing that kind of fix two weeks
before when a crime actually existed

1064
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:04,980
before when a crime actually existed
 

1065
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,520
before when a crime actually existed
fantastic we had that kind of preventive

1066
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:07,530
fantastic we had that kind of preventive
 

1067
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,500
fantastic we had that kind of preventive
maintenance let's say you're not pro and

1068
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,510
maintenance let's say you're not pro and
 

1069
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,000
maintenance let's say you're not pro and
you want an anti-malware product that is

1070
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,010
you want an anti-malware product that is
 

1071
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,620
you want an anti-malware product that is
going to be proactive instead of

1072
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:12,630
going to be proactive instead of
 

1073
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,960
going to be proactive instead of
reactive absolutely yes because in the

1074
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:14,970
reactive absolutely yes because in the
 

1075
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,280
reactive absolutely yes because in the
case of something like ransomware you

1076
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,290
case of something like ransomware you
 

1077
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,540
case of something like ransomware you
can lose everything

1078
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:17,550
can lose everything
 

1079
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,270
can lose everything
yep and so there is no reactive response

1080
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,280
yep and so there is no reactive response
 

1081
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,610
yep and so there is no reactive response
to that then I hope your backups are

1082
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:22,620
to that then I hope your backups are
 

1083
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,010
to that then I hope your backups are
good yes actually

1084
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,020
good yes actually
 

1085
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,990
good yes actually
going back to that initial question

1086
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,000
going back to that initial question
 

1087
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,970
going back to that initial question
about the current threat landscape you

1088
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:28,980
about the current threat landscape you
 

1089
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,530
about the current threat landscape you
are seeing the still you're seeing a

1090
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:30,540
are seeing the still you're seeing a
 

1091
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,900
are seeing the still you're seeing a
really prevalent presence of the

1092
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:32,910
really prevalent presence of the
 

1093
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,810
really prevalent presence of the
wrestler however now the the crypto

1094
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:35,820
wrestler however now the the crypto
 

1095
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,640
wrestler however now the the crypto
actors in just in this general they are

1096
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:37,650
actors in just in this general they are
 

1097
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,440
actors in just in this general they are
not only encrypting your data and

1098
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,450
not only encrypting your data and
 

1099
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,630
not only encrypting your data and
holding you for ransom but if you're not

1100
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:41,640
holding you for ransom but if you're not
 

1101
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,280
holding you for ransom but if you're not
paying they are actually releasing the

1102
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,290
paying they are actually releasing the
 

1103
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,290
paying they are actually releasing the
data and selling that data so it

1104
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,300
data and selling that data so it
 

1105
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,960
data and selling that data so it
shouldn't be left yes well that can be

1106
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:47,970
shouldn't be left yes well that can be
 

1107
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,530
shouldn't be left yes well that can be
even worse yeah so Wow yeah that's scary

1108
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:51,540
even worse yeah so Wow yeah that's scary
 

1109
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,320
even worse yeah so Wow yeah that's scary
stuff so what else does does your

1110
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,330
stuff so what else does does your
 

1111
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,130
stuff so what else does does your
product so again to just look at why I

1112
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:58,140
product so again to just look at why I
 

1113
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,050
product so again to just look at why I
get the question all the time RAF

1114
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:00,060
get the question all the time RAF
 

1115
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,560
get the question all the time RAF
yep why should I buy the greater product

1116
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,570
yep why should I buy the greater product
 

1117
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,300
yep why should I buy the greater product
when the antivirus has been working so

1118
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,310
when the antivirus has been working so
 

1119
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,560
when the antivirus has been working so
well for me for so long

1120
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:06,570
well for me for so long
 

1121
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,480
well for me for so long
so as you said it might be a couple

1122
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,490
so as you said it might be a couple
 

1123
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,840
so as you said it might be a couple
bucks more dollars so more per seat

1124
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:11,850
bucks more dollars so more per seat
 

1125
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,600
bucks more dollars so more per seat
which can be a lot if you've got 10,000

1126
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:14,610
which can be a lot if you've got 10,000
 

1127
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,850
which can be a lot if you've got 10,000
computers but in a in a small medium

1128
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:16,860
computers but in a in a small medium
 

1129
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,190
computers but in a in a small medium
business it's not that much why would I

1130
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
business it's not that much why would I
 

1131
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,760
business it's not that much why would I
pay more the additional features that we

1132
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:22,770
pay more the additional features that we
 

1133
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,150
pay more the additional features that we
have in the full endpoint security

1134
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,160
have in the full endpoint security
 

1135
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,280
have in the full endpoint security
solution from a technical perspective

1136
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,290
solution from a technical perspective
 

1137
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,260
solution from a technical perspective
and again I'm talking about 150 dollars

1138
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,270
and again I'm talking about 150 dollars
 

1139
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,840
and again I'm talking about 150 dollars
more is well worth it the value is

1140
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:32,850
more is well worth it the value is
 

1141
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,540
more is well worth it the value is
actually there so I'm thinking of not

1142
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:35,550
actually there so I'm thinking of not
 

1143
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,820
actually there so I'm thinking of not
only adding additional layers of

1144
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:37,830
only adding additional layers of
 

1145
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,710
only adding additional layers of
protection to your computer either at

1146
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
protection to your computer either at
 

1147
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,770
protection to your computer either at
home or at your business but I'm also

1148
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:42,780
home or at your business but I'm also
 

1149
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,170
home or at your business but I'm also
getting additional visibility on what's

1150
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,180
getting additional visibility on what's
 

1151
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,150
getting additional visibility on what's
happening on your environment as well so

1152
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,160
happening on your environment as well so
 

1153
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,520
happening on your environment as well so
let's say one of the features on that

1154
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,530
let's say one of the features on that
 

1155
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,700
let's say one of the features on that
new on that bigger product let's say the

1156
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:52,710
new on that bigger product let's say the
 

1157
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,460
new on that bigger product let's say the
endpoint security is a personal firewall

1158
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,470
endpoint security is a personal firewall
 

1159
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,350
endpoint security is a personal firewall
which will potentially hit place your

1160
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,360
which will potentially hit place your
 

1161
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,750
which will potentially hit place your
Windows Firewall in my computer and not

1162
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
Windows Firewall in my computer and not
 

1163
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,900
Windows Firewall in my computer and not
only it will allow you to actually have

1164
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:01,910
only it will allow you to actually have
 

1165
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,430
only it will allow you to actually have
visibility on the network layer so

1166
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,440
visibility on the network layer so
 

1167
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,950
visibility on the network layer so
instead of only looking for viruses or

1168
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
instead of only looking for viruses or
 

1169
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,350
instead of only looking for viruses or
Trojans or brain somewhere I'm also

1170
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
Trojans or brain somewhere I'm also
 

1171
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,150
Trojans or brain somewhere I'm also
looking for duplicate IP address and

1172
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,160
looking for duplicate IP address and
 

1173
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,860
looking for duplicate IP address and
looking for DNS poisoning that's

1174
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:12,870
looking for DNS poisoning that's
 

1175
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,270
looking for DNS poisoning that's
interesting yeah so now possibly network

1176
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,280
interesting yeah so now possibly network
 

1177
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,940
interesting yeah so now possibly network
traffic problems or even social yes

1178
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:19,950
traffic problems or even social yes
 

1179
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,010
traffic problems or even social yes
which are not necessarily security

1180
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,020
which are not necessarily security
 

1181
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,350
which are not necessarily security
incidents but it can be a natural threat

1182
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
incidents but it can be a natural threat
 

1183
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,060
incidents but it can be a natural threat
so for example one of the detection that

1184
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,070
so for example one of the detection that
 

1185
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,850
so for example one of the detection that
is a port scanning so maybe your users

1186
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:32,860
is a port scanning so maybe your users
 

1187
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,090
is a port scanning so maybe your users
is a given actor inside your network is

1188
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,100
is a given actor inside your network is
 

1189
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,820
is a given actor inside your network is
scanning your servers for whatever

1190
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:38,830
scanning your servers for whatever
 

1191
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,450
scanning your servers for whatever
reason

1192
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:39,460
reason
 

1193
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,850
reason
where's they're not supposed to be doing

1194
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:41,860
where's they're not supposed to be doing
 

1195
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,830
where's they're not supposed to be doing
that so yeah it gives you that

1196
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
that so yeah it gives you that
 

1197
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
that so yeah it gives you that
visibility so you can actually go to the

1198
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,610
visibility so you can actually go to the
 

1199
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,040
visibility so you can actually go to the
user and have a conversation to see

1200
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,050
user and have a conversation to see
 

1201
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,600
user and have a conversation to see
what's what's going on yeah I've never

1202
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:48,610
what's what's going on yeah I've never
 

1203
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,190
what's what's going on yeah I've never
really thought about that as a threat

1204
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,200
really thought about that as a threat
 

1205
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,190
really thought about that as a threat
yeah because like a duplicate IP address

1206
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
yeah because like a duplicate IP address
 

1207
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,600
yeah because like a duplicate IP address
you just think oh well I accidentally

1208
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:54,610
you just think oh well I accidentally
 

1209
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,130
you just think oh well I accidentally
assigned that same IP to a printer or

1210
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:56,140
assigned that same IP to a printer or
 

1211
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,420
assigned that same IP to a printer or
something but what if it's a threat

1212
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,430
something but what if it's a threat
 

1213
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,650
something but what if it's a threat
actor exactly yeah

1214
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:58,660
actor exactly yeah
 

1215
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,840
actor exactly yeah
maybe someone is ruining their IP

1216
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:00,850
maybe someone is ruining their IP
 

1217
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,870
maybe someone is ruining their IP
address yeah mm-hmm interesting and you

1218
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:03,880
address yeah mm-hmm interesting and you
 

1219
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,120
address yeah mm-hmm interesting and you
mentioned about the firewall how and I

1220
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,130
mentioned about the firewall how and I
 

1221
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,500
mentioned about the firewall how and I
don't want to put you too much on the

1222
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:07,510
don't want to put you too much on the
 

1223
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,180
don't want to put you too much on the
spot but absolutely I mean Microsoft

1224
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,190
spot but absolutely I mean Microsoft
 

1225
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,670
spot but absolutely I mean Microsoft
Windows 10 comes with a firewall yep so

1226
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:11,680
Windows 10 comes with a firewall yep so
 

1227
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,760
Windows 10 comes with a firewall yep so
do I really need to supplement my

1228
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,770
do I really need to supplement my
 

1229
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,890
do I really need to supplement my
anti-malware with a firewall for Mesa we

1230
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:16,900
anti-malware with a firewall for Mesa we
 

1231
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,100
anti-malware with a firewall for Mesa we
do see a two main approaches for that

1232
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,110
do see a two main approaches for that
 

1233
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,230
do see a two main approaches for that
replacement let's say so the first one

1234
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
replacement let's say so the first one
 

1235
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,090
replacement let's say so the first one
is ease of use so we do provide a

1236
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,100
is ease of use so we do provide a
 

1237
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,070
is ease of use so we do provide a
management console that will allow you

1238
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
management console that will allow you
 

1239
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,360
management console that will allow you
to have much more user-friendly

1240
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,370
to have much more user-friendly
 

1241
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,350
to have much more user-friendly
configuration and deployment of that

1242
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
configuration and deployment of that
 

1243
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,610
configuration and deployment of that
that's specific and we're talking

1244
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:32,620
that's specific and we're talking
 

1245
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,530
that's specific and we're talking
centralized manner not certainly okay so

1246
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:34,540
centralized manner not certainly okay so
 

1247
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,720
centralized manner not certainly okay so
all 10,000 of my computer's yeah

1248
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:36,730
all 10,000 of my computer's yeah
 

1249
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,320
all 10,000 of my computer's yeah
absolutely

1250
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,330
absolutely
 

1251
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,750
absolutely
all five of my computers just create the

1252
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
all five of my computers just create the
 

1253
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,550
all five of my computers just create the
policies and push it out to your

computers yes again it's fully automated
 

1257
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,800
computers yes again it's fully automated
so it's pretty convenient to use and the

1258
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:46,810
so it's pretty convenient to use and the
 

1259

so it's pretty convenient to use and the
second reason is the visibility so you

1260
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
second reason is the visibility so you
 

1261
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,210
second reason is the visibility so you
do have access to a lot of reporting

1262
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,220
do have access to a lot of reporting
 

1263
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,100
do have access to a lot of reporting
that's actually coming from the main the

1264
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,110
that's actually coming from the main the
 

1265
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,980
that's actually coming from the main the
natural fire road component let's say

1266
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:55,990
natural fire road component let's say
 

1267
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,980
natural fire road component let's say
you can get a list of all the users on

1268
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:58,990
you can get a list of all the users on
 

1269
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,560
you can get a list of all the users on
your network that's had a port scanner

1270
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:01,570
your network that's had a port scanner
 

1271
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,600
your network that's had a port scanner
on your environment on a given time

1272
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:03,610
on your environment on a given time
 

1273
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,940
on your environment on a given time
frame so that's the kind of awareness

1274
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:05,950
frame so that's the kind of awareness
 

1275
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,370
frame so that's the kind of awareness
the kind of visibility that some other

ago you might be losing some advant

1330
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,030
ago you might be losing some advant
 

1331
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,260
ago you might be losing some advant
advantage in there so you might be

1332
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,270
advantage in there so you might be
 

1333
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,910
advantage in there so you might be
actually lagging behind and sometimes

1334
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:22,920
actually lagging behind and sometimes
 

1335

your IT departments so so you you are

1356
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:46,710
your IT departments so so you you are
 

1357
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,890
your IT departments so so you you are
well protected we are seeing coming back

1358
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:51,900
well protected we are seeing coming back
 

1359
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,330
well protected we are seeing coming back
to a question we are seeing a lot of the

1360
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:55,340
to a question we are seeing a lot of the
 

1361
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,120
to a question we are seeing a lot of the
the movements in general whenever we are

1362
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,130
the movements in general whenever we are
 

1363
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,790
the movements in general whenever we are
looking at the data so we are seeing a

1364
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:01,800
looking at the data so we are seeing a
 

1365
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,250
looking at the data so we are seeing a
lot of the new threats coming from two

1366
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,260
lot of the new threats coming from two
 

1367
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,090
lot of the new threats coming from two
main avenues let's say so the first one

1368
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,100
main avenues let's say so the first one
 

1369
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,330
main avenues let's say so the first one
is hardware so whenever thinking of FEMA

1370
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:11,340
is hardware so whenever thinking of FEMA
 

1371
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,700
is hardware so whenever thinking of FEMA
for example you have a BIOS update you

1372
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:13,710
for example you have a BIOS update you
 

1373
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,250
for example you have a BIOS update you
have a new chipset on your computer yes

1374
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:16,260
have a new chipset on your computer yes
 

1375
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,860
have a new chipset on your computer yes
it's actually possible to in fact or

1376
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:18,870
it's actually possible to in fact or
 

1377
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,070
it's actually possible to in fact or
true to - in fact that that given a

1378
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
true to - in fact that that given a
 

1379
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,420
true to - in fact that that given a
component on your computer another point

1380
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:26,430
component on your computer another point
 

1381
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,000
component on your computer another point
that we have and we actually have a lot

1382
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,010
that we have and we actually have a lot
 

1383
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,160
that we have and we actually have a lot
of research going on on that specific

1384
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,170
of research going on on that specific
 

1385
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,310
of research going on on that specific
one is the user behavior so let's say

1386
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
one is the user behavior so let's say
 

1387
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
one is the user behavior so let's say
that usually when you think user

1388
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,330
that usually when you think user
 

1389
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,300
that usually when you think user
behavior probably the biggest example is

1390
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,310
behavior probably the biggest example is
 

1391
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,210
behavior probably the biggest example is
credit card company so you have your

1392
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,220
credit card company so you have your
 

1393
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,950
credit card company so you have your
credit card in Canada that credit card

1394
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
credit card in Canada that credit card
 

1395
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,710
credit card in Canada that credit card

1401
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,030
available everywhere it might create a
trigger hey it's something that card is

1402
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,040
trigger hey it's something that card is
 

1403
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,310
trigger hey it's something that card is
not supposed to be used in Asia for

1404
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
not supposed to be used in Asia for
 

1405
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,370
not supposed to be used in Asia for
example in Europe or anywhere else and

1406
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,380
example in Europe or anywhere else and
 

1407
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,020
example in Europe or anywhere else and
we are started to see some some some

1408
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,030
we are started to see some some some
 

1409
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,400
we are started to see some some some
efforts from different vendors actually

1410
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,410
efforts from different vendors actually
 

1411
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,340
efforts from different vendors actually
to try to correlate all the incidents or

1412
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:08,350
to try to correlate all the incidents or
 

1413
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,670
to try to correlate all the incidents or
all the the the incidents in general the

1414
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:11,680
all the the the incidents in general the
 

1415
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,400
all the the the incidents in general the
security stance that we flag we also try

1416
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,410
security stance that we flag we also try
 

1417
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,170
security stance that we flag we also try
to map that to the actual user behavior

1418
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,180
to map that to the actual user behavior
 

1419
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,590
to map that to the actual user behavior
so hey that user has just had his email

1420
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
so hey that user has just had his email
 

1421
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,290
so hey that user has just had his email
access in Canada being accessed in

1422
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:22,300
access in Canada being accessed in
 

1423
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,510
access in Canada being accessed in
Europe nape that's a user that's always

1424
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:24,520
Europe nape that's a user that's always
 

1425
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,430
Europe nape that's a user that's always
traveling so yeah it's kind of expected

1426
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:26,440
traveling so yeah it's kind of expected
 

1427
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,560
traveling so yeah it's kind of expected
maybe not that user is an internal user

1428
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:28,570
maybe not that user is an internal user
 

1429
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,960
maybe not that user is an internal user
he has no reason to have that kind of

1430
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:30,970
he has no reason to have that kind of
 

1431
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,060
he has no reason to have that kind of
exposure in there so we can actually

1432
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,070
exposure in there so we can actually
 

1433
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,310
exposure in there so we can actually
create a ticket and we can flag that as

1434
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:35,320
create a ticket and we can flag that as
 

1435
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,790
create a ticket and we can flag that as
a potential incident so your admins can

1436
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:38,800
a potential incident so your admins can
 

1437
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,400
a potential incident so your admins can
can take a look at it interesting and we

1438
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,410
can take a look at it interesting and we
 

1439
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,740
can take a look at it interesting and we
can do that so this is not as a

1440
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:43,750
can do that so this is not as a
 

1441
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,990
can do that so this is not as a
third-party service but as an internal

1442
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
third-party service but as an internal
 

1443
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,110
third-party service but as an internal
absolutely powerful yeah in mastering

1444
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,120
absolutely powerful yeah in mastering
 

1445
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,210
absolutely powerful yeah in mastering
and again the amount of data that's

1446
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,220
and again the amount of data that's
 

1447
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,360
and again the amount of data that's
coming out of those surfaces is so big

1448
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,370
coming out of those surfaces is so big
 

1449
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,000
coming out of those surfaces is so big
that automation is critical for that and

1450
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,010
that automation is critical for that and
 

1451
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,800
that automation is critical for that and
so we do have a lot of automation

1452
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:58,810
so we do have a lot of automation
 

1453
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,100
so we do have a lot of automation
capabilities in our products yeah and

1454
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,110
capabilities in our products yeah and
 

1455
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,870
capabilities in our products yeah and
again it's everything to make your life

1456
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:03,880
again it's everything to make your life
 

1457
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,490
again it's everything to make your life
easier and I've never really thought of

1458
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:05,500
easier and I've never really thought of
 

1459
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,990
easier and I've never really thought of
it outside the context of the credit

1460
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,000
it outside the context of the credit
 

1461
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,300
it outside the context of the credit
card like a perfect example if I view it

1462
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,310
card like a perfect example if I view it
 

1463
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,910
card like a perfect example if I view it
and you see it sometimes where is it's

1464
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:11,920
and you see it sometimes where is it's
 

1465
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,310
and you see it sometimes where is it's
an inconvenience but if your credit card

1466
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
an inconvenience but if your credit card
 

1467
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,560
an inconvenience but if your credit card
ever was stolen and used maliciously

1468
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,570
ever was stolen and used maliciously
 

1469
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,820
ever was stolen and used maliciously
then you want to know about it and

1470
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:17,830
then you want to know about it and
 

1471
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,080
then you want to know about it and
here's a service that you're offering

1472
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,090
here's a service that you're offering
 

1473
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,120
here's a service that you're offering
and evolving in 2020 that is in-house so

1474
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,130
and evolving in 2020 that is in-house so
 

1475
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,640
and evolving in 2020 that is in-house so
absolutely I have control over that so

1476
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:26,650
absolutely I have control over that so
 

1477
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,050
absolutely I have control over that so
you're thinking of your credit card what

1478
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,060
you're thinking of your credit card what
 

1479
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,270
you're thinking of your credit card what
if it's your email access or maybe your

1480
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:30,280
if it's your email access or maybe your
 

1481
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
if it's your email access or maybe your
scene number

1482
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,290
scene number
 

1483
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,350
scene number
public data basically it's private it

1484
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:34,360
public data basically it's private it
 

1485
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,450
public data basically it's private it
should be private and we are trying to

1486
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:36,460
should be private and we are trying to
 

1487
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,100
should be private and we are trying to
make it remain private so is that the

1488
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,110
make it remain private so is that the
 

1489
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,210
make it remain private so is that the
evolution of malware do you think is

1490
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:41,220
evolution of malware do you think is
 

1491
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,480
evolution of malware do you think is
targeting data yeah I would say so I

1492
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,490
targeting data yeah I would say so I
 

1493
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,790
targeting data yeah I would say so I
don't see specific data to confirm that

1494
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:50,800
don't see specific data to confirm that
 

1495
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,160
don't see specific data to confirm that
that application but I do believe that's

1496
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,170
that application but I do believe that's
 

1497
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,420
that application but I do believe that's
that's something that is going to happen

1498
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:54,430
that's something that is going to happen
 

1499
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,470
that's something that is going to happen
we are having we are we as as citizens

1500
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:58,480
we are having we are we as as citizens
 

1501
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,510
we are having we are we as as citizens
we are actually

1502
00:31:59,510 --> 00:31:59,520
we are actually
 

1503
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,690
we are actually
producing more data every single day the

1504
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:02,700
producing more data every single day the
 

1505
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,130
producing more data every single day the
amount of data that we have associated

1506
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,140
amount of data that we have associated
 

1507
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,560
amount of data that we have associated
to our profiles is massive either from

1508
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:09,570
to our profiles is massive either from
 

1509
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,799
to our profiles is massive either from
financial data health care data social

1510
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:12,809
financial data health care data social
 

1511
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:16,700
financial data health care data social
networking data work data basically so

1512
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,710
networking data work data basically so
 

1513
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,570
networking data work data basically so
we should see more custom attacks

1514
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:20,580
we should see more custom attacks
 

1515
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,060
we should see more custom attacks
targeting specific users or specifically

1516
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,070
targeting specific users or specifically
 

1517

we've learned excellent I don't want to
overwhelm the viewers grand scheme of

1524
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,250
overwhelm the viewers grand scheme of
 

1525
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:35,780
overwhelm the viewers grand scheme of
things

1526
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:35,790
things
 

1527
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,130
things
I mean 2020 is going to be an

1528
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,140
I mean 2020 is going to be an
 

1529
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,780
I mean 2020 is going to be an
interesting year I think from the

1530
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:38,790
interesting year I think from the
 

1531
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,760
interesting year I think from the
cybersecurity land absolutely are we

1532
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:40,770
cybersecurity land absolutely are we
 

1533
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,799
cybersecurity land absolutely are we
still seeing attacks in the ransomware

1534
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:42,809
still seeing attacks in the ransomware
 

1535
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:45,080
still seeing attacks in the ransomware
end of things are we still you know ease

1536
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,090
end of things are we still you know ease
 

1537
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,180
end of things are we still you know ease
that customers are generally protected

1538
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,190
that customers are generally protected
 

1539
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,220
that customers are generally protected
against them yes there is - a lot of

1540
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,230
against them yes there is - a lot of
 

1541
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,890
against them yes there is - a lot of
ransomware going on I don't see that

1542
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:51,900
ransomware going on I don't see that
 

1543
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,460
ransomware going on I don't see that
going down not not not not in the near

1544
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:55,470
going down not not not not in the near
 

1545
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,880
going down not not not not in the near
future at least it's still evolving and

1546
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:58,890
future at least it's still evolving and
 

1547
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:03,500
future at least it's still evolving and
the actual organizations that are

1548
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:03,510
the actual organizations that are
 

1549
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,940
the actual organizations that are
actually organization the backend that

1550
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:04,950
actually organization the backend that
 

1551
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,190
actually organization the backend that
are running with those rare some layers

1552
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
are running with those rare some layers
 

1553
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,169
are running with those rare some layers
they are still making a profit that's

1554
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:09,179
they are still making a profit that's
 

1555
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,600
they are still making a profit that's
the same yeah so yeah the question for

1556
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:11,610
the same yeah so yeah the question for
 

1557
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,100
the same yeah so yeah the question for
years when it was just viruses on the

1558
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,110
years when it was just viruses on the
 

1559
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,049
years when it was just viruses on the
landscape the question was always what's

1560
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:15,059
landscape the question was always what's
 

1561
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,970
landscape the question was always what's
the motivation of a hacker yep to do

1562
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:16,980
the motivation of a hacker yep to do
 

1563
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,390
the motivation of a hacker yep to do
this

the web it's brutal yeah yeah Microsoft

1880
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,390
the web it's brutal yeah yeah Microsoft
 

1881
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,880
the web it's brutal yeah yeah Microsoft
has been continually letting us down

1882
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:20,890
has been continually letting us down
 

1883
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,900
has been continually letting us down
Windows 10 has been a nightmare as

1884
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:24,910
Windows 10 has been a nightmare as
 

1885
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,910
Windows 10 has been a nightmare as
Microsoft to ever not let us down

1886
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:26,920
Microsoft to ever not let us down
 

1887
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,510
Microsoft to ever not let us down
I mean maybe back like Windows 93 95 we

1888
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:30,520
I mean maybe back like Windows 93 95 we
 

1889
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,230
I mean maybe back like Windows 93 95 we
can say that but I mean I know it did

1890
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
can say that but I mean I know it did
 

1891
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,870
can say that but I mean I know it did
feel like they were giving it an effort

1892
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:35,880
feel like they were giving it an effort
 

1893
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,940
feel like they were giving it an effort
but at one point and they had the better

1894
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:38,950
but at one point and they had the better
 

1895
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,030
but at one point and they had the better
team they had the the testing team

1896
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,040
team they had the the testing team
 

1897
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,089
team they had the the testing team
before patches went out and but stuff

1898
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:45,099
before patches went out and but stuff
 

1899
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:47,130
before patches went out and but stuff
like this and having to wait for weeks

1900
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:47,140
like this and having to wait for weeks
 

1901
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,480
like this and having to wait for weeks
for it's actively exploited yes yes that

1902
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,490
for it's actively exploited yes yes that
 

1903
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,760
for it's actively exploited yes yes that
is a takeover bug like this is something

1904
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:53,770
is a takeover bug like this is something
 

1905
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,620
is a takeover bug like this is something
that could completely compromise an

1906
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:55,630
that could completely compromise an
 

1907
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,020
that could completely compromise an
entire network of machines and so if

1908
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,030
entire network of machines and so if
 

1909
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,130
entire network of machines and so if
somebody a miscreant knows of the

1910
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:02,140
somebody a miscreant knows of the
 

1911
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,980
somebody a miscreant knows of the
vulnerability within let's say a

1912
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:04,990
vulnerability within let's say a
 

1913
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,700
vulnerability within let's say a
business network and actively exploits

1914
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:08,710
business network and actively exploits
 

1915
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,059
business network and actively exploits
it because it is like understand folks

1916
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:11,069
it because it is like understand folks
 

1917
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:14,039
it because it is like understand folks
this is an exploit that is currently

1918
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:14,049
this is an exploit that is currently
 

1919
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:17,990
this is an exploit that is currently
being used by hackers to infiltrate

1920
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,000
being used by hackers to infiltrate
 

1921
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,150
being used by hackers to infiltrate
networks it is currently being used

1922
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,160
networks it is currently being used
 

1923
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,759
networks it is currently being used
so if that's the case wouldn't it be

1924
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:24,769
so if that's the case wouldn't it be
 

1925
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,400
so if that's the case wouldn't it be
prudent for a company like Microsoft to

1926
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,410
prudent for a company like Microsoft to
 

1927
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,700
prudent for a company like Microsoft to
say we need to fix this and we need to

1928
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:30,710
say we need to fix this and we need to
 

1929
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,170
say we need to fix this and we need to
fix this now yes instead they're waiting

1930
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:35,180
fix this now yes instead they're waiting
 

1931
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,099
fix this now yes instead they're waiting
a month at least at least four weeks I

1932
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:39,109
a month at least at least four weeks I
 

1933
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:40,960
a month at least at least four weeks I
mean we're talking the the second

1934
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:40,970
mean we're talking the the second
 

1935
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,620
mean we're talking the the second
Tuesday of February why four weeks

1936
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:44,630
Tuesday of February why four weeks
 

1937
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,710
Tuesday of February why four weeks
though like why that's that's arbitrary

1938
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:47,720
though like why that's that's arbitrary
 

1939
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,480
though like why that's that's arbitrary
it's just the second Tuesday of every

1940
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:49,490
it's just the second Tuesday of every
 

1941
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,950
it's just the second Tuesday of every
month is when they issue their patches

1942
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
month is when they issue their patches
 

1943
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,400
month is when they issue their patches
well I get that but yeah why not push

1944
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,410
well I get that but yeah why not push
 

1945
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,640
well I get that but yeah why not push
through an update because they don't

1946
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:57,650
through an update because they don't
 

1947
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,759
through an update because they don't
because it's the rollout happens on on

1948
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:00,769
because it's the rollout happens on on
 

1949
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,279
because it's the rollout happens on on
that schedule they this is the thing

1950
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:03,289
that schedule they this is the thing
 

1951
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:04,630
that schedule they this is the thing
they've said it they've set themselves

1952
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
they've said it they've set themselves
 

1953
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,109
they've said it they've set themselves
up for this type of failure see I their

1954
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:08,119
up for this type of failure see I their
 

1955
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:10,210
up for this type of failure see I their
infrastructure is set up for this type

1956
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:10,220
infrastructure is set up for this type
 

1957
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,769
infrastructure is set up for this type
of failure now but I don't know why they

1958
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:11,779
of failure now but I don't know why they
 

1959
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,059
of failure now but I don't know why they
couldn't even just post it to their

1960
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:13,069
couldn't even just post it to their
 

1961
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:17,220
couldn't even just post it to their
website and say update manually like

1962
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,230
website and say update manually like
 

1963
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,170
website and say update manually like
nobody's gonna do it but if you unless

1964
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:20,180
nobody's gonna do it but if you unless
 

1965
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:25,059
nobody's gonna do it but if you unless
you know but even if you know that that

1966
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:25,069
you know but even if you know that that
 

1967
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:27,819
you know but even if you know that that
patch exists imagine if you had a

1968
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:27,829
patch exists imagine if you had a
 

1969
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:29,620
patch exists imagine if you had a
hundred computers and you had to

1970
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:29,630
hundred computers and you had to
 

1971
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,690
hundred computers and you had to
manually go like the whole Windows

1972
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:31,700
manually go like the whole Windows
 

1973
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,940
manually go like the whole Windows
infrastructure right now is a brutal

1974
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:33,950
infrastructure right now is a brutal
 

1975
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,450
infrastructure right now is a brutal
nightmare that's true it's just

1976
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:36,460
nightmare that's true it's just
 

1977
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,579
nightmare that's true it's just
ridiculous and it's really causing

1978
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:39,589
ridiculous and it's really causing
 

1979
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:41,620
ridiculous and it's really causing
companies I especially companies that

1980
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:41,630
companies I especially companies that
 

1981
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,599
companies I especially companies that
are currently stuck on window like that

1982
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:43,609
are currently stuck on window like that
 

1983
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:45,910
are currently stuck on window like that
have Windows 7 machines intermixed in

1984
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
have Windows 7 machines intermixed in
 

1985
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,519
have Windows 7 machines intermixed in
their network yeah a lot of government

1986
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:48,529
their network yeah a lot of government
 

1987
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:51,849
their network yeah a lot of government
agencies and we're looking at okay well

1988
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:51,859
agencies and we're looking at okay well
 

1989
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:54,730
agencies and we're looking at okay well
what do we do next do we buy all new

1990
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:54,740
what do we do next do we buy all new
 

1991
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,670
what do we do next do we buy all new
systems so we can install Windows 10

1992
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:56,680
systems so we can install Windows 10
 

1993
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,249
systems so we can install Windows 10
because that's usually necessary unless

1994
00:43:00,249 --> 00:43:00,259
because that's usually necessary unless
 

1995
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:02,289
because that's usually necessary unless
you can maybe put more RAM in them

1996
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:02,299
you can maybe put more RAM in them
 

1997
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:03,609
you can maybe put more RAM in them
because you're gonna need at least like

1998
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:03,619
because you're gonna need at least like
 

1999
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,249
because you're gonna need at least like
twice as much RAM you're gonna need an

2000
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:06,259
twice as much RAM you're gonna need an
 

2001
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:08,680
twice as much RAM you're gonna need an
SSD to you know make it right yeah like

2002
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:08,690
SSD to you know make it right yeah like
 

2003
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,880
SSD to you know make it right yeah like
you're gonna need to upgrade you're not

2004
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:09,890
you're gonna need to upgrade you're not
 

2005
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,650
you're gonna need to upgrade you're not
gonna be using a five year old computer

2006
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:11,660
gonna be using a five year old computer
 

2007
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,930
gonna be using a five year old computer
for Windows 10 that's for sure though at

2008
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:13,940
for Windows 10 that's for sure though at
 

2009
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,220
for Windows 10 that's for sure though at
least not without a couple of little

2010
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,230
least not without a couple of little
 

2011
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,130
least not without a couple of little
upgrades so you know we look at that and

2012
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:18,140
upgrades so you know we look at that and
 

2013
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,900
upgrades so you know we look at that and
then we say okay well what other options

2014
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:19,910
then we say okay well what other options
 

2015
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,099
then we say okay well what other options
are there and these are things that

2016
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:21,109
are there and these are things that
 

2017
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:22,930
are there and these are things that
we're gonna be talking about here on the

2018
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:22,940
we're gonna be talking about here on the
 

2019
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,839
we're gonna be talking about here on the
show but it really just makes you go wow

2020
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:27,849
show but it really just makes you go wow
 

2021
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,760
show but it really just makes you go wow
hold on let's back up a second and say

2022
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:32,770
hold on let's back up a second and say
 

2023
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,620
hold on let's back up a second and say
what's really you know what's what's

2024
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:35,630
what's really you know what's what's
 

2025
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,410
what's really you know what's what's
happening here mm-hmm maybe it's a

2026
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:38,420
happening here mm-hmm maybe it's a
 

2027
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,480
happening here mm-hmm maybe it's a
wake-up call to to say maybe Microsoft

2028
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:40,490
wake-up call to to say maybe Microsoft
 

2029
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,790
wake-up call to to say maybe Microsoft
has got way too much control over our

2030
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800

00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,420
they are in that's right that's not how
they work and so just understand that

2648
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:50,430
they work and so just understand that
 

2649
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,090
they work and so just understand that
and maybe if you just at least at least

00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:53,100
and maybe if you just at least at least
 

2651
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,950
and maybe if you just at least at least
make yourself critical enough to be able

2652
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
make yourself critical enough to be able
 

2653
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,380
make yourself critical enough to be able

service if you can just say that to

00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:00,300
service if you can just say that to
 

2657
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,150
service if you can just say that to
yourself then maybe that's enough to

yourself then maybe that's enough to
 

2659
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,400
yourself then maybe that's enough to
protect you so that when that call comes

protect you so that when that call comes

2935
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,230
altering it to put it in the receptor to
find the cancer cells so that's a bit of

find the cancer cells so that's a bit of
 

2937
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,059
find the cancer cells so that's a bit of
a genetic modification and then they're

2938
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:21,069
a genetic modification and then they're
 

2939
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,880

culturing more so there can't be adverse

mean I don't understand the science I

2944
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:29,410
mean I don't understand the science I

but I know there was a time in our
 

2949
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:38,099

history when penicillin didn't exist and

when and when it was discovered if you
 

2953
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:45,750

will know it was a mistake yeah but so

2954
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,760
will know it was a mistake yeah but so
 

2955
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,670
will know it was a mistake yeah but so
when it was accidentally discovered how

2956
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:49,680
when it was accidentally discovered how
 

2957
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,440
when it was accidentally discovered how
earth-shatteringly like how many lives

2958
