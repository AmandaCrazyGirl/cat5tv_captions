and speaking of adding extra storage we
 

621
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:58,019
and speaking of adding extra storage we
need to be able to get into that that

622
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:58,029
need to be able to get into that that
 

623

943
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,900
looks like so what I'm gonna do I just
want to make sure actually I'm gonna

944
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:03,910
want to make sure actually I'm gonna
 

945
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,940
want to make sure actually I'm gonna
share the same I'm gonna set the same

946
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:05,950

screen so that you guys can see what I

948
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
screen so that you guys can see what I
 

949
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,460
screen so that you guys can see what I
see it's on dual screen so I'm going to

950
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:11,470
see it's on dual screen so I'm going to
 

951
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,470
see it's on dual screen so I'm going to
instead set this to mirror so what I'm

952
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,480
instead set this to mirror so what I'm
 

953
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,020
instead set this to mirror so what I'm
seeing on my screen is I'm gonna drag

954
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,030
seeing on my screen is I'm gonna drag
 

955
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,550
seeing on my screen is I'm gonna drag
this over for you so that you can see

956
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:17,560
this over for you so that you can see
 

957
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,770
this over for you so that you can see
because it's actually operating as two

958
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:19,780
because it's actually operating as two
 

959
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,400
because it's actually operating as two
monitors okay so on my screen here I'm

960
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,410
monitors okay so on my screen here I'm
 

961
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,920
monitors okay so on my screen here I'm
gonna check that checkbox that's set and

962
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:25,930
gonna check that checkbox that's set and
 

963
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,800
gonna check that checkbox that's set and
so this is over USB C so it actually has

964
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:28,810
so this is over USB C so it actually has
 

965
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,660
so this is over USB C so it actually has
a video output and I've selected to show

966
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,670
a video output and I've selected to show
 

967
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,440
a video output and I've selected to show
the same thing on both screens so

968
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,450
the same thing on both screens so
 

969
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,120
the same thing on both screens so
presumably if I hit apply this is it

970
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,130
presumably if I hit apply this is it
 

971
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,830
presumably if I hit apply this is it
really awkward because that screen is

972
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
really awkward because that screen is
 

973
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,500
really awkward because that screen is
actually not a real screen there we go

974
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:40,510
actually not a real screen there we go
 

975
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,230
actually not a real screen there we go
okay so keep this configuration and now

976
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,240
okay so keep this configuration and now
 

977
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,130
okay so keep this configuration and now
we can both see the exact same screen so

978
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,140
we can both see the exact same screen so
 

979
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,380
we can both see the exact same screen so
you and I are looking at the same screen

980
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,390
you and I are looking at the same screen
 

981
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,650
you and I are looking at the same screen
here so that's USB C output and that's

982
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:52,660
here so that's USB C output and that's
 

983
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,330
here so that's USB C output and that's
important to note and I wanted you to

985
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,910
important to note and I wanted you to
see that because if you plug that USB C

installed cheese because I wanted to
 

1055
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,560
installed cheese because I wanted to
point out that we actually have a

1056
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:25,570
point out that we actually have a
 

1057
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,190
point out that we actually have a
built-in webcam on this system so this

1058
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
built-in webcam on this system so this
 

1059
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,860
built-in webcam on this system so this
is a 1080p webcam and even though with

1060
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:31,870
is a 1080p webcam and even though with
 

1061
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,220
is a 1080p webcam and even though with
cheese booted here so this is gonna

1062
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,230
cheese booted here so this is gonna
 

1063
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,480
cheese booted here so this is gonna
presumably there we go you can see that

1064
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,490
presumably there we go you can see that
 

1065
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,610
presumably there we go you can see that
the the framerate is really really poor

1066
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:38,620
the the framerate is really really poor
 

1067
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:47,370
the the framerate is really really poor
right right there I am but but it does

1068
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:47,380
right right there I am but but it does
 

1069
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,500
right right there I am but but it does
work really quite well and the picture

1070
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,510
work really quite well and the picture
 

1071
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,799
work really quite well and the picture
looks pretty good let's take a quick is

1072
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:52,809
looks pretty good let's take a quick is
 

1073
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,539
looks pretty good let's take a quick is
that just a setting as to why it's so

1074
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:54,549
that just a setting as to why it's so
 

1075
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:59,400
that just a setting as to why it's so
low well I don't know yeah I think what

1076
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,410
low well I don't know yeah I think what
 

1077
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,500
low well I don't know yeah I think what
we're gonna find is that with something

1078
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:01,510
we're gonna find is that with something
 

1079
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,600
we're gonna find is that with something
like the pine Book Pro and I think this

1080
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:03,610
like the pine Book Pro and I think this
 

1081
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,490
like the pine Book Pro and I think this
is important to note and maybe this is

1082
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:05,500
is important to note and maybe this is
 

1083
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,480
is important to note and maybe this is
something I should have mentioned right

1084
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,490
something I should have mentioned right
 

1085
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,060
something I should have mentioned right
off the top what it is this is let's

1086
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,070
off the top what it is this is let's
 

1087
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,310
off the top what it is this is let's
consider it experimental let's consider

1088
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,320
consider it experimental let's consider
 

1089
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,140
consider it experimental let's consider
this something that is bleeding edge and

1090
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,150
this something that is bleeding edge and
 

1091
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,610
this something that is bleeding edge and
mind-blowing yeah let's say if you are a

1092
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:16,620
mind-blowing yeah let's say if you are a
 

1093
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:21,419
mind-blowing yeah let's say if you are a
Linux lover if you love to tinker this

1094
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:21,429
Linux lover if you love to tinker this
 

1095
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:24,419
Linux lover if you love to tinker this
might be a notebook for you yeah because

1096
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:24,429
might be a notebook for you yeah because
 

1097
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,070
might be a notebook for you yeah because
probably gonna run into little issues

1098
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
probably gonna run into little issues
 

1099
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,720
probably gonna run into little issues
like that did you see the countdown 1 2

1100
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:27,730
like that did you see the countdown 1 2
 

1101
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,450
like that did you see the countdown 1 2
3 2 1 and it was like all gibberish so

1102
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:30,460
3 2 1 and it was like all gibberish so
 

1103
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,590
3 2 1 and it was like all gibberish so
there's something wrong there and I'm

1104
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
there's something wrong there and I'm
 

1105
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,700
there's something wrong there and I'm
gonna probably have to figure that out

1106
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:32,710
gonna probably have to figure that out
 

1107
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,549
gonna probably have to figure that out
if I if I care I kind of thought it was

1108
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:35,559
if I if I care I kind of thought it was
 

1109
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,129
if I if I care I kind of thought it was
a cool feature it looks like a flash

1110
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:37,139
a cool feature it looks like a flash
 

1111
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,629
a cool feature it looks like a flash
it's like 3 2 1 to prepare this like

1112
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:39,639
it's like 3 2 1 to prepare this like
 

1113
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:41,009
it's like 3 2 1 to prepare this like
scream flash it's like okay but it

1114
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:41,019
scream flash it's like okay but it
 

1115
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,389
scream flash it's like okay but it
didn't really look like a 3 do that it

1116
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:42,399
didn't really look like a 3 do that it
 

1117
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,230
didn't really look like a 3 do that it
was like gibberish

1118
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:43,240
was like gibberish
 

1119
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,930
was like gibberish
but reminds me of like the first ever

1120
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:45,940
but reminds me of like the first ever
 

1121
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,259
but reminds me of like the first ever

webcam yes big deal so there's there's a
 

1127
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,310
webcam yes big deal so there's there's a
community that is involved in all Pine

1150
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:24,549
Linux system tools speaking of let's
 

1151
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:26,369
Linux system tools speaking of let's
bring up like system monitor and let's

1152
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:26,379
bring up like system monitor and let's
 

1153
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:27,899
bring up like system monitor and let's
just kind of see what this looks like

1154
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:27,909
just kind of see what this looks like
 

1155
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,879
just kind of see what this looks like
hold on for a second so this is a two

1156
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:29,889
hold on for a second so this is a two
 

1157
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:31,950

hundred dollar Linux notebook computer
 

1159
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,940
hundred dollar Linux notebook computer
that's this thin that's a that has no

1160
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:35,950
that's this thin that's a that has no
 

1161
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,080
that's this thin that's a that has no
moving parts so if I can I don't know if

1162
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,090
moving parts so if I can I don't know if
 

1163
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,820
moving parts so if I can I don't know if
you can really get your head around that

1164
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:41,830
you can really get your head around that
 

1165
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,639
you can really get your head around that
at home but when this is sitting on my

1166
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:44,649
at home but when this is sitting on my
 

1167
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:47,369
at home but when this is sitting on my
lap there's no fan noise yep there's

1168
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:47,379
lap there's no fan noise yep there's
 

1169
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,279
lap there's no fan noise yep there's
very little heat and a little bit of

1170
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:50,289
very little heat and a little bit of
 

1171
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:52,169
very little heat and a little bit of
heat off of the one side where the soc

1172
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:52,179
heat off of the one side where the soc
 

1173
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:54,869
heat off of the one side where the soc
is that's the system-on-chip to see what

1174
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:54,879
is that's the system-on-chip to see what
 

1175
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:56,940
is that's the system-on-chip to see what
we would call a CPU yeah there's a

1176
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:56,950
we would call a CPU yeah there's a
 

1177
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,899
we would call a CPU yeah there's a
little bit of heat there but it's

1178
00:25:57,899 --> 00:25:57,909
little bit of heat there but it's
 

1179
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:00,659
little bit of heat there but it's
dissipated quite well but really like

1180
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:00,669
dissipated quite well but really like
 

1181
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,379
dissipated quite well but really like
there's no noise coming off so you don't

1182
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:04,389
there's no noise coming off so you don't
 

1183
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:05,850
there's no noise coming off so you don't
have any of those moving parts that you

1184
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:05,860
have any of those moving parts that you
 

1185
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,009
have any of those moving parts that you
do on a normal traditional laptop so

1186
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:08,019
do on a normal traditional laptop so
 

1187
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:09,690
do on a normal traditional laptop so
what have I been using this for well

1188
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:09,700
what have I been using this for well
 

1189
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,480
what have I been using this for well
it's not a super powerful laptop but

1190
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,490
it's not a super powerful laptop but
 

1191
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,669
it's not a super powerful laptop but
it's quite good as far as getting on the

you've got to update the touchpad

1202
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,850
you've got to update the touchpad
 

1203
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,609
you've got to update the touchpad
firmware make sure you do that right out

need to install you'll find out more
 

1209
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:32,310
need to install you'll find out more
about that in the pine 64 forums very

1210
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
about that in the pine 64 forums very
 

1211
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,230
about that in the pine 64 forums very
very important for for the sensitivity

1212
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
very important for for the sensitivity
 

1213
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,200
very important for for the sensitivity
and accuracy of that but we've got

1214
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,210
and accuracy of that but we've got
 

1215
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,659
and accuracy of that but we've got
or gigs of ram and what i've been using

oh you know what I mean yeah okay so
this becomes a terminal so it's

1268
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:50,220
this becomes a terminal so it's
 

1269
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,860
this becomes a terminal so it's
brilliant for that it's proven itself to

1270
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:52,870
brilliant for that it's proven itself to
 

1271
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,659
brilliant for that it's proven itself to
be brilliant for that but at the same

1272
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:54,669
be brilliant for that but at the same
 

1273
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:56,820
be brilliant for that but at the same
time it's also great without that

1274
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:56,830
time it's also great without that

lot of your stuff just right in there so
 

1285
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,360
lot of your stuff just right in there so
let's get a quick boo at this system

1286
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,370
let's get a quick boo at this system
 

1287
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,220
let's get a quick boo at this system
itself because I mean though the real

1288
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,230
itself because I mean though the real
 

1289
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,049
itself because I mean though the real
question is okay if I'm not using it

1290
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:16,059
question is okay if I'm not using it
 

1291
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:18,600
question is okay if I'm not using it
connected to a big powerful system is it

1292
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:18,610
connected to a big powerful system is it
 

1293
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,480
connected to a big powerful system is it
still gonna work as a pretty decent

1294
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,490
still gonna work as a pretty decent
 

1295
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,620
still gonna work as a pretty decent
computer one of the things that you're

1296
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:22,630
computer one of the things that you're
 

1297
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,330
computer one of the things that you're
gonna notice is down here at the bottom

1298
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,340
gonna notice is down here at the bottom
 

1299
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,789
gonna notice is down here at the bottom
right it's jumping around between four

1300
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
right it's jumping around between four
 

1301
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,310
right it's jumping around between four
hundred and eight megahertz to one point

1302
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,320
hundred and eight megahertz to one point
 

1303
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,350
hundred and eight megahertz to one point
four two gigahertz and so on it's

1304
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
four two gigahertz and so on it's
 

1305
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,970
four two gigahertz and so on it's
jumping all over the place because it's

1306
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:32,980
jumping all over the place because it's
 

1307
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,269
jumping all over the place because it's
selecting the processor frequency based

1308
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:36,279
selecting the processor frequency based
 

1309
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,519
selecting the processor frequency based
on my usage so it's getting faster and

1310
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:38,529
on my usage so it's getting faster and
 

1311
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,440
on my usage so it's getting faster and
it's giving more power taking more juice

1312
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,450
it's giving more power taking more juice
 

1313
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,080
it's giving more power taking more juice
from the 10,000 milliamp hour battery

1314
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,090
from the 10,000 milliamp hour battery
 

1315
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,080
from the 10,000 milliamp hour battery
and based on my requirements right but

1316
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,090
and based on my requirements right but
 

1317
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,180
and based on my requirements right but
if I'm not really doing much if it's

1318
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,190
if I'm not really doing much if it's
 

1319
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,919
if I'm not really doing much if it's
idling it'll just clock itself down to

1320
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:49,929
idling it'll just clock itself down to
 

1321
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:50,460
idling it'll just clock itself down to
four

1322
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:50,470
four
 

1323
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,409
four
eight megahertz which is going to use

1324
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:52,419
eight megahertz which is going to use
 

1325
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,690
eight megahertz which is going to use
very very little power yeah presumably

1326
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:54,700
very very little power yeah presumably
 

1327
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,960
very very little power yeah presumably
all right so I'm just gonna cancel out

1328
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:57,970
all right so I'm just gonna cancel out
 

1329
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,509
all right so I'm just gonna cancel out
of that guy and let's jump onto YouTube

Canadian education system is that they

1466
00:31:59,129 --> 00:31:59,139
Canadian education system is that they
 

1467
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:03,299
Canadian education system is that they
don't teach skills they teach software

1468
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:03,309
don't teach skills they teach software
 

1469
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:06,240
don't teach skills they teach software
that's true and so when you go to school

1470
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,250
that's true and so when you go to school
 

1471
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,609
that's true and so when you go to school
when you pay to go to college you're

1472
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:08,619
when you pay to go to college you're
 

1473
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:11,639
when you pay to go to college you're
paying to learn Microsoft Office that is

1474
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:11,649
paying to learn Microsoft Office that is
 

1475
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:15,659
paying to learn Microsoft Office that is
not the skill sets that so so to

1476
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:15,669
not the skill sets that so so to
 

1477
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:17,789
not the skill sets that so so to
translate that from microsoft office -

1478
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:17,799
translate that from microsoft office -
 

1479
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,600
translate that from microsoft office -
libreoffice

1480
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:18,610
libreoffice
 

1481
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,580
libreoffice
can be a challenge so I'll give you that

1482
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:20,590
can be a challenge so I'll give you that
 

1483
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,850
can be a challenge so I'll give you that
one little caveat and it's and that is a

1484
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:23,860
one little caveat and it's and that is a
 

1485
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,830
one little caveat and it's and that is a
problem but that's a problem in the

1486
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
problem but that's a problem in the
 

1487
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,629
problem but that's a problem in the
education sector that's not a problem

1488
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:27,639
education sector that's not a problem
 

1489
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,259
education sector that's not a problem
with this device and I think if we have

1490
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:31,269
with this device and I think if we have
 

1491
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:33,060
with this device and I think if we have
a good troubleshooting mind and and

1492
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,070
a good troubleshooting mind and and
 

1493
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,519
a good troubleshooting mind and and
maybe a father who is willing to take

1494
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:35,529
maybe a father who is willing to take
 

1495
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:38,129
maybe a father who is willing to take
the time to to help their son and and

1496
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:38,139
the time to to help their son and and
 

1497
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:40,919
the time to to help their son and and
show them okay well yeah in in Microsoft

1498
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:40,929
show them okay well yeah in in Microsoft
 

1499
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:43,379
show them okay well yeah in in Microsoft
Word it's like that but in libreoffice

1500
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:43,389
Word it's like that but in libreoffice
 

1501
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:45,269
Word it's like that but in libreoffice
it's like this it's similar it's very

1502
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
it's like this it's similar it's very
 

1503
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,070
it's like this it's similar it's very
very close but it's a little bit

1504
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,080
very close but it's a little bit
 

1505
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,249
very close but it's a little bit
different but see we have a dual boot

1506
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:50,259
different but see we have a dual boot
 

1507
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,279
different but see we have a dual boot
system yeah both Linux and windows yeah

1508
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:53,289
system yeah both Linux and windows yeah
 

1509
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:56,399
system yeah both Linux and windows yeah
and all windows I also have Microsoft

1510
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:56,409
and all windows I also have Microsoft
 

1511
00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:00,869
and all windows I also have Microsoft
Office and Libre okay so they use both

Office and Libre okay so they use both
 

1513
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,340
Office and Libre okay so they use both
but for a lot of their school it's all

1514
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,350
but for a lot of their school it's all

of retropie so yeah what you would need

1642
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280

1647
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,260
the approach of installing debian and
then installing retropie on top of that

1648
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,270
then installing retropie on top of that
 

1649
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,600
then installing retropie on top of that
a little bit different I don't think

look from the satellite basically down
 

2779
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,410
look from the satellite basically down
on the area like like that's sci-fi from

on the area like like that's sci-fi from
 

2781

gotten really morbid right but on that
 

2823

gotten really morbid right but on that
one turns out yeah it was a guy with his

2824
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:29,460
one turns out yeah it was a guy with his
 

2825
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,220
one turns out yeah it was a guy with his
dog and the dog was jumping in the water

and it was the wet dock and I made it

2830
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:36,120
and it was the wet dock and I made it
 

2831
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,760
and it was the wet dock and I made it
look like blood so the point of this is

2832
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:39,770
look like blood so the point of this is
 

2833
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,530
look like blood so the point of this is
just cuz you see it on Google Earth

2834
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,540
just cuz you see it on Google Earth
 

2835
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,450
just cuz you see it on Google Earth
doesn't mean it is what you think it is

2836
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:44,460
doesn't mean it is what you think it is
 

2837
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,790
doesn't mean it is what you think it is
that's true but there's not a whole lot

01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:46,800
that's true but there's not a whole lot
 

2839

doesn't matter you can't look at
 

2843
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,020
doesn't matter you can't look at
something as a topographical view it's a

2844
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:54,030
something as a topographical view it's a
 

2845
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,360
something as a topographical view it's a
2,000 feet tall look at that it's the

2846
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:56,370
2,000 feet tall look at that it's the
 

2847
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,730
2,000 feet tall look at that it's the
it's actually the shadow of a penguin

01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,260
right like come on I will say I spend
some time in Google Earth on my VR like

2852
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:06,270
some time in Google Earth on my VR like
 

2853
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,110
some time in Google Earth on my VR like
if I sometime I mean on the daily

2854
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:08,120
if I sometime I mean on the daily
 

2855

so no matter where where you are in the

2864
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:21,690
so no matter where where you are in the
 

2865
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,690
so no matter where where you are in the
world at the end of the not the world

2866
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:23,700
world at the end of the not the world
 

2867
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,880
world at the end of the not the world
but like this time of year you're always

2868
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:25,890
but like this time of year you're always
 

2869
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,150
but like this time of year you're always
gonna have the Sun at a very horizontal

2870
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:29,160
gonna have the Sun at a very horizontal
 

2871
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,670
gonna have the Sun at a very horizontal
angle so it's gonna create different

2872
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
angle so it's gonna create different
 

2873
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,320
angle so it's gonna create different
shot that's why that penguin looks like

2874
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:33,330
shot that's why that penguin looks like
 

2875
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:37,160
shot that's why that penguin looks like
a giant exactly yeah I'm not buying it I

2876
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:37,170
a giant exactly yeah I'm not buying it I
 

2877
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,620
a giant exactly yeah I'm not buying it I
don't think so I don't think it's a

2878
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:39,630
don't think so I don't think it's a
 

2879
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,480
don't think so I don't think it's a
2,000 foot structure the amount of

2880
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:41,490
2,000 foot structure the amount of
 

2881
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,840
2,000 foot structure the amount of
planes it's not gonna happen

2882
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:44,850
planes it's not gonna happen
 

2883
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,600
planes it's not gonna happen
I think the only valid use for Google

2884
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:47,610
I think the only valid use for Google
 

2885
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,140
I think the only valid use for Google
Earth is to see where viewers are

we can start to see just outside of the
royal town of Sutton Coldfield we've got

2894
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:03,720
royal town of Sutton Coldfield we've got
 

2895
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,620
royal town of Sutton Coldfield we've got
viewers and we should be able to zoom

2896

viewers and we should be able to zoom
 

2897
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,020
viewers and we should be able to zoom
all over the place yeah

2898
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,030
all over the place yeah
 

2899
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,200
all over the place yeah
viewers all where are we right now no
