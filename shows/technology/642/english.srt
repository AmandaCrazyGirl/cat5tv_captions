the drive tray so it was contained

160
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,220
the drive tray so it was contained
 

161
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,449
the drive tray so it was contained
within the tray so so the tray itself

162
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:08,459
within the tray so so the tray itself
 

163
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,770
within the tray so so the tray itself
actually had some plastic components as

164
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:10,780
actually had some plastic components as
 

165
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,930
actually had some plastic components as
well those plastic components melted and

166
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:12,940
well those plastic components melted and
 

167
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,830
well those plastic components melted and
dripped down Wow but the washburn it was

168
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:16,840
dripped down Wow but the washburn it was
 

169
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,630
dripped down Wow but the washburn it was
like oh it was a fire it was a fire

170
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:18,640
like oh it was a fire it was a fire
 

171
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,890
like oh it was a fire it was a fire
inside the case of the hard drive yeah

172
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:21,900
inside the case of the hard drive yeah
 

173
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,779
inside the case of the hard drive yeah
the SSD

174
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:24,789
the SSD
 

175
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,700
the SSD
and that's a crazy part is that it's an

176
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:26,710
and that's a crazy part is that it's an
 

177
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,129
and that's a crazy part is that it's an
SSD like I I could see that maybe with

178
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:29,139
SSD like I I could see that maybe with
 

179
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,990
SSD like I I could see that maybe with
you know traditional hard drive with my

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,000
you know traditional hard drive with my
 

181
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,420
you know traditional hard drive with my
moving parts but an SSD to catch fire I

182
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,430
moving parts but an SSD to catch fire I
 

183
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,520
moving parts but an SSD to catch fire I
would be really proud if it was like I'm

184
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,530
would be really proud if it was like I'm
 

185
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,260
would be really proud if it was like I'm
moving parts thing like I worked that

186
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,270
moving parts thing like I worked that
 

187
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,730
moving parts thing like I worked that
beast so I got it up to 15 billion rpm

188
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:41,740
beast so I got it up to 15 billion rpm
 

189

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,210
nobody must have burnt for a while it
was pretty bad so so you did you get

194
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:48,220
was pretty bad so so you did you get
 

195
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,920

ah this is just my desktop computer I

198
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,030
ah this is just my desktop computer I
 

199
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,390
ah this is just my desktop computer I
didn't have names running monitoring on

200
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
didn't have names running monitoring on
 

201
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,059
didn't have names running monitoring on
it or anything like that however because

202
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:57,069
it or anything like that however because
 

203
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,800
it or anything like that however because
the board the it did make me think

204
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:58,810
the board the it did make me think
 

205
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,830
the board the it did make me think
because the motherboard has USB ports on

206
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
because the motherboard has USB ports on
 

207
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,379
because the motherboard has USB ports on
the motherboard yeah I think I might put

208
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:04,389
the motherboard yeah I think I might put
 

209
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,070
the motherboard yeah I think I might put
a temper device in my computer chassis

210
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
a temper device in my computer chassis
 

211
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,360
a temper device in my computer chassis
and a temper devices like a USB thermal

212
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,370
and a temper devices like a USB thermal
 

213
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,939
and a temper devices like a USB thermal
sensor we did do that

214
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:17,949
sensor we did do that
 

215
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:20,100
sensor we did do that
so imagine putting that in and then I

216
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,110
so imagine putting that in and then I
 

217
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,450
so imagine putting that in and then I
could have gotten an alert from Nimes

218
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:21,460
could have gotten an alert from Nimes

MEMS that the data is accurate so then

230
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,050
MEMS that the data is accurate so then
 

231
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,719
MEMS that the data is accurate so then
you would have gone to see it in action

232
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:42,729
you would have gone to see it in action
 

233
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,830
you would have gone to see it in action
brought some marshmallows yeah but

234
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:46,840
brought some marshmallows yeah but
 

235
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,510
brought some marshmallows yeah but
thankfully it was contained because that

236
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:48,520
thankfully it was contained because that
 

237
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,950
thankfully it was contained because that
could have impacted the entire office

238
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:49,960
could have impacted the entire office
 

239
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,360
could have impacted the entire office
yeah but doesn't it make you think about

240
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,370
yeah but doesn't it make you think about
 

241
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,520
yeah but doesn't it make you think about
like all these like builds that I'm

242
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,530
like all these like builds that I'm
 

243
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,129
like all these like builds that I'm
doing and and some of them made of

244
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:56,139
doing and and some of them made of
 

245
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,700
doing and and some of them made of
cardboard so I'm really kind of

246
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,710
cardboard so I'm really kind of
 

247
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,950
cardboard so I'm really kind of
rethinking the materials that I use for

248
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:01,960
rethinking the materials that I use for
 

249
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,719
rethinking the materials that I use for
my builds and and you know I think about

250
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:03,729
my builds and and you know I think about
 

251
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,749
my builds and and you know I think about
kks be cases for for single board

252
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:06,759
kks be cases for for single board
 

253
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,399
kks be cases for for single board
computers and how they're like solid

254
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,409
computers and how they're like solid
 

255
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,010
computers and how they're like solid
steel mm-hmm then and fabricated steel

256
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,020
steel mm-hmm then and fabricated steel
 

257
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,370
steel mm-hmm then and fabricated steel
and that just says quality to me and

258
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:14,380
and that just says quality to me and
 

259
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,680
and that just says quality to me and
like that's gonna it's gonna protect me

260
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,690
like that's gonna it's gonna protect me
 

261
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,629
like that's gonna it's gonna protect me
an event of like a short circuit or

262
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
an event of like a short circuit or
 

263
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,770
an event of like a short circuit or
something like that I don't know what

264
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:19,780
something like that I don't know what
 

265
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,909
something like that I don't know what
happened to the drive it was like an

266
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:20,919
happened to the drive it was like an
 

267
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,830
happened to the drive it was like an
internal thing I've never had a hard

268
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:22,840
internal thing I've never had a hard
 

269
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,080
internal thing I've never had a hard

had a fire like that yeah yeah I was the

274
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:31,719
had a fire like that yeah yeah I was the
 

275
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,769
had a fire like that yeah yeah I was the
computer that I built on four years ago

276
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:33,779
computer that I built on four years ago
 

277
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,029
computer that I built on four years ago
six months in all sudden and I'm like

278
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:36,039
six months in all sudden and I'm like
 

279
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:36,660
six months in all sudden and I'm like
what is that

280
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:36,670
what is that
 

281
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,570
what is that
spell yeah and then I went down with a

282
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:39,580
spell yeah and then I went down with a
 

283
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,480
spell yeah and then I went down with a
computer and I realize oh it's smoked

284
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,490
computer and I realize oh it's smoked
 

285
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,760
computer and I realize oh it's smoked
sure but I've burnt capacitors I've had

286
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:44,770
sure but I've burnt capacitors I've had
 

287
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,860
sure but I've burnt capacitors I've had
things burst yeah but I'm talking this

288
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:46,870
things burst yeah but I'm talking this
 

289
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,610
things burst yeah but I'm talking this
caught on fire like literally I was not

290
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:50,620
caught on fire like literally I was not
 

291
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,290
caught on fire like literally I was not
from heat this was like a short circuit

292
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:52,300
from heat this was like a short circuit
 

293
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,940
from heat this was like a short circuit
in the power lines or something whew

294
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:53,950
in the power lines or something whew
 

295
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,420
in the power lines or something whew
within the drive the crazy stuff so so

296
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,430
within the drive the crazy stuff so so
 

297
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,700
within the drive the crazy stuff so so
now I mean hey I've never seen it happen

298
00:06:59,700 --> 00:06:59,710
now I mean hey I've never seen it happen
 

299
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,730
now I mean hey I've never seen it happen
before but now I know it could happen

300
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:04,740
before but now I know it could happen
 

301
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,460
before but now I know it could happen
really it actually did happen - Robbie

302
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:08,470
really it actually did happen - Robbie
 

303
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,830
really it actually did happen - Robbie
what are the stats I want I think we

304
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:10,840
what are the stats I want I think we
 

305
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,130
what are the stats I want I think we
should all try to simulate it make it

306
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:14,140
should all try to simulate it make it
 

307
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,580
should all try to simulate it make it
happen oh yeah I wonder if there's a kid

308
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:17,590
happen oh yeah I wonder if there's a kid
 

309
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,650
happen oh yeah I wonder if there's a kid
like there is some data as to what could

310
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:19,660
like there is some data as to what could
 

311
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,680
like there is some data as to what could
cause an SSD to light on fire what's on

312
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:22,690
cause an SSD to light on fire what's on
 

313
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,850
cause an SSD to light on fire what's on
the inside I don't think it's a very

314
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:23,860
the inside I don't think it's a very
 

315
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,780
the inside I don't think it's a very
common thing

316
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:24,790
common thing
 

317
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,030
common thing
what what's on the inside of it what is

318
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,040
what what's on the inside of it what is
 

319
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,690
what what's on the inside of it what is
that you've got a PCB circuit board with

320
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:30,700
that you've got a PCB circuit board with
 

321
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,590
that you've got a PCB circuit board with
with with memory modules yeah

322
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:34,600
with with memory modules yeah
 

323
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,560
with with memory modules yeah
essentially and and some resistors and

324
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,570
essentially and and some resistors and
 

325
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,390
essentially and and some resistors and
all kinds of little circuits and stuff

326
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,400
all kinds of little circuits and stuff
 

327
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,170
all kinds of little circuits and stuff
but so something in there no there's no

328
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,180
but so something in there no there's no
 

329
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,720
but so something in there no there's no
moving parts and some something in there

330
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:45,730
moving parts and some something in there
 

331
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,730
moving parts and some something in there
short-circuited I think and maybe like

332
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:47,740
short-circuited I think and maybe like
 

333
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,670
short-circuited I think and maybe like
12 volt hit something else and decided

334
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:50,680
12 volt hit something else and decided
 

335
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,370
12 volt hit something else and decided
to explode and catch I don't know the

336
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:53,380
to explode and catch I don't know the
 

337
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,960
to explode and catch I don't know the
interesting is that it happened when you

338
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:54,970
interesting is that it happened when you
 

339
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,400
interesting is that it happened when you
weren't in the office because if it

340
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,410
weren't in the office because if it
 

341
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,630
weren't in the office because if it
happened while you were in the office

342
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:57,640
happened while you were in the office
 

343
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,340
happened while you were in the office
you might have taken a while for you to

344
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,350
you might have taken a while for you to
 

345
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,320
you might have taken a while for you to
figure out I might have been like okay

346
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,330
figure out I might have been like okay
 

347
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,480
figure out I might have been like okay
my computer's on fire like you see what

348
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,490
my computer's on fire like you see what
 

349
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,880
my computer's on fire like you see what
a smell died oh yeah brutal yeah you

350
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:05,890
a smell died oh yeah brutal yeah you
 

351
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,110
a smell died oh yeah brutal yeah you
might have ruined your computer with

352
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
might have ruined your computer with
 

353
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,940
might have ruined your computer with
like a fire extinguisher at that point

354
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:08,950
like a fire extinguisher at that point
 

355
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,430
like a fire extinguisher at that point
maybe yeah it's probably good probably

356
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
maybe yeah it's probably good probably
 

357
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,350
maybe yeah it's probably good probably
good well but an electrical fire

358
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
good well but an electrical fire
 

359
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,350
good well but an electrical fire
contained within an aluminum boxes yeah

360
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,360
contained within an aluminum boxes yeah
 

361
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,070
contained within an aluminum boxes yeah
hopefully pretty safe was in one of my

362
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
hopefully pretty safe was in one of my
 

363
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,770
hopefully pretty safe was in one of my
wooden chassis why do I smell charred

364
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:25,780
wooden chassis why do I smell charred
 

365
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,580
wooden chassis why do I smell charred
Hickory Wow speaking of burnt have you

366
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:29,590
Hickory Wow speaking of burnt have you
 

367
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,980
Hickory Wow speaking of burnt have you
tried any healthy foods lately I am

368
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:31,990
tried any healthy foods lately I am
 

369
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,190
tried any healthy foods lately I am
always trying healthy foods Jeff because

370
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,200
always trying healthy foods Jeff because
 

371
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,960
always trying healthy foods Jeff because
I'm learning from the technology that

372
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:36,970
I'm learning from the technology that
 

373
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm learning from the technology that
I've invested in now my budget was a

374
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,370
I've invested in now my budget was a
 

375
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,770
I've invested in now my budget was a
hundred bucks as you know so a few weeks

376
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:40,780
hundred bucks as you know so a few weeks
 

377
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,170
hundred bucks as you know so a few weeks
ago we started looking at the various

378
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,180
ago we started looking at the various
 

379
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,850
ago we started looking at the various
technologies like my fitness tracker

380
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:44,860
technologies like my fitness tracker
 

381
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,550
technologies like my fitness tracker
like my smart scale that allow me to

382
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:47,560
like my smart scale that allow me to
 

383
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,720
like my smart scale that allow me to
educate myself about my health

384
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,730
educate myself about my health
 

385
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,250
educate myself about my health
to be able to lose some weight

386
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,260
to be able to lose some weight
 

387
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,410
to be able to lose some weight
inevitably as kind of a side effect of

388
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:53,420
inevitably as kind of a side effect of
 

389
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,520
inevitably as kind of a side effect of
that and I have consistent so so

390
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,530
that and I have consistent so so
 

391
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,140
that and I have consistent so so
whenever I tell you how much I've lost

392
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,150
whenever I tell you how much I've lost
 

393
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,330
whenever I tell you how much I've lost
it's it's only based on consistency so

394
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:01,340
it's it's only based on consistency so
 

395
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,840
it's it's only based on consistency so
if I if I hit seven point six pounds

396
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:04,850
if I if I hit seven point six pounds
 

397
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,910
if I if I hit seven point six pounds
loss and then I went back to six point

398
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:06,920
loss and then I went back to six point
 

399
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,290
loss and then I went back to six point
I'm gonna I'm not gonna tell you seven

400
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:08,300
I'm gonna I'm not gonna tell you seven
 

401
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,540
I'm gonna I'm not gonna tell you seven
but I've been consistently beyond of the

402
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:10,550
but I've been consistently beyond of the
 

403
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,870
but I've been consistently beyond of the
seven pounds mark now so another couple

404
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:13,880
seven pounds mark now so another couple
 

405
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,670
seven pounds mark now so another couple
pounds since last week and I've only

406
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
pounds since last week and I've only
 

407
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,110
pounds since last week and I've only
been doing it for a month and it's just

408
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
been doing it for a month and it's just
 

409
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
been doing it for a month and it's just
by educating myself but part of that

410
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,130
by educating myself but part of that
 

411
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,210
by educating myself but part of that
Jeff is yeah eating a little well eating

412
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,220
Jeff is yeah eating a little well eating
 

413
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,370
Jeff is yeah eating a little well eating
healthy but I've cut carbs as much as I

414
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:27,380
healthy but I've cut carbs as much as I
 

415
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,950
healthy but I've cut carbs as much as I
can from my diet because I learned about

416
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:29,960
can from my diet because I learned about
 

417
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,350
can from my diet because I learned about
the fact that I'm burning carbs instead

418
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,360
the fact that I'm burning carbs instead
 

419
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,820
the fact that I'm burning carbs instead
of burning fat and it's working as

420
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:33,830
of burning fat and it's working as
 

421
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,010
of burning fat and it's working as
really it actually is working so yeah I

422
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,020
really it actually is working so yeah I
 

423
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,470
really it actually is working so yeah I
did like I've been using cauliflower

424
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
did like I've been using cauliflower
 

425
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,660
did like I've been using cauliflower
instead of rice so ground up cauliflower

426
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:40,670
instead of rice so ground up cauliflower
 

427
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,230
instead of rice so ground up cauliflower
yeah it's actually delicious so yeah so

428
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
yeah it's actually delicious so yeah so
 

429
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,060
yeah it's actually delicious so yeah so
and it's like a rice substitute but

430
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,070
and it's like a rice substitute but
 

431
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,340
and it's like a rice substitute but
there's no carbs so but it's just like a

432
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,350
there's no carbs so but it's just like a
 

433
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,560
there's no carbs so but it's just like a
plate of vegetable instead of rice you

434
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,570
plate of vegetable instead of rice you
 

435
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,380
plate of vegetable instead of rice you
can cut up some green onions oh yes

436
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:55,390
can cut up some green onions oh yes
 

437
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,700
can cut up some green onions oh yes
mushrooms and stuff like that I would

438
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:57,710
mushrooms and stuff like that I would
 

439
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,980
mushrooms and stuff like that I would
I'll have pizza once a like I get a

440
00:09:59,980 --> 00:09:59,990
I'll have pizza once a like I get a
 

441
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,420
I'll have pizza once a like I get a
cheap day once a week so I took my

442

cheap day once a week so I took my
 

443
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,110
cheap day once a week so I took my
daughter for her pizza and we had like a

444
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
daughter for her pizza and we had like a
 

445
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,820
daughter for her pizza and we had like a
cheese pizza and that's fun I also have

446
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,830
cheese pizza and that's fun I also have
 

447
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,350
cheese pizza and that's fun I also have
started so now I'm at that point where

448
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
started so now I'm at that point where
 

449
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,660
started so now I'm at that point where
I've kind of not plateaued I'm still

450
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:13,670
I've kind of not plateaued I'm still
 

451
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,810
I've kind of not plateaued I'm still
losing weight fairly consistently but

452
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:16,820
losing weight fairly consistently but
 

453
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,470
losing weight fairly consistently but
fairly slowly so one of the things in we

454
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
fairly slowly so one of the things in we
 

455
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,140
fairly slowly so one of the things in we

458
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,120
and Marshman had mentioned that one of
 

459
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,300
and Marshman had mentioned that one of
the things I can do to kind of

460
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,310
the things I can do to kind of
 

461
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,300
the things I can do to kind of
accelerate things is to to sustain

462
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,310
accelerate things is to to sustain
 

463
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,920
accelerate things is to to sustain
exercise in such a way that okay like if

464
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:35,930
exercise in such a way that okay like if

467
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,760
I run up the stairs yeah my heart rate
gets going but then it's it settles back

468
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:39,770
gets going but then it's it settles back
 

469
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,430
gets going but then it's it settles back
down but right I'm done well so do

down but right I'm done well so do
 

471
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,650
down but right I'm done well so do

only on on the one that the two that are

1238
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:02,760
only on on the one that the two that are
 

1239
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,010
only on on the one that the two that are
plugged in oh oh my god look at you you

1240
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,020
plugged in oh oh my god look at you you
 

1241
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,190
plugged in oh oh my god look at you you
observe and fella so yeah okay so you've

1242
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,200
observe and fella so yeah okay so you've
 

1243
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,510
observe and fella so yeah okay so you've
got the power and then the one that it's

1244
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
got the power and then the one that it's
 

1245
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
got the power and then the one that it's
in plug in more that's it what happened

1246
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:13,530
in plug in more that's it what happened
 

1247
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,920
in plug in more that's it what happened
so let's log everything and to connect

1248
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:15,930
so let's log everything and to connect
 

1249
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,240
so let's log everything and to connect
sure connect

1250
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,250
sure connect
 

1251
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,160
sure connect
I didn't get my phone what are you

1252
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,170
I didn't get my phone what are you
 

1253

looking for see ya I only have one see
all right you got to buy the right

1256
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,370
all right you got to buy the right
 

1257
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,520
all right you got to buy the right
cables folks but there's like a mine the

1258
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:26,530
cables folks but there's like a mine the
 

1259
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,640
cables folks but there's like a mine the
one well I'm using it on my phone

1260
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,650
one well I'm using it on my phone
 

1261
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,530
one well I'm using it on my phone
threaded once those are all see a USB

1262
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:31,540
threaded once those are all see a USB
 

1263
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,080
threaded once those are all see a USB
micro okay so you didn't get diversified

1264
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,090
micro okay so you didn't get diversified
 

1265
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,850
micro okay so you didn't get diversified
pack okay yeah all right well let's test

1266
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:35,860
pack okay yeah all right well let's test
 

1267
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,890
pack okay yeah all right well let's test
it this way if I move the connector to

1268
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:37,900
it this way if I move the connector to
 

1269
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:45,600
it this way if I move the connector to
another port yeah cool look at that so

1270
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:45,610
another port yeah cool look at that so
 

1271
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,430
another port yeah cool look at that so
you actually see the blue lights up

1272
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440
you actually see the blue lights up
 

1273
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,030
you actually see the blue lights up
Oh USB see as well yeah USB see sorry

1274
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,040
Oh USB see as well yeah USB see sorry
 

1275
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,160
Oh USB see as well yeah USB see sorry
Sasha okay so in there it is charging

00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,170
Sasha okay so in there it is charging
 

1277
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,490
Sasha okay so in there it is charging
this one has I believe built-in surge

does not have that and truthfully when I

1290
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:12,309
does not have that and truthfully when I
 

1291
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:13,740
does not have that and truthfully when I
was looking for a banking station that

1292
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:13,750
was looking for a banking station that
 

1293
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,940
was looking for a banking station that
wasn't something I was thinking of I

1294
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:14,950
wasn't something I was thinking of I
 

1295
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,160
wasn't something I was thinking of I
just wanted to be lucky to have all the

1296
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,170
just wanted to be lucky to have all the
 

1297
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,530
just wanted to be lucky to have all the
phones outer parts yeah exactly so

1298
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:19,540
phones outer parts yeah exactly so
 

1299
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,000
phones outer parts yeah exactly so
that's a nice very nice feature and it

1300
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,010
that's a nice very nice feature and it
 

1301
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,510
that's a nice very nice feature and it
is 10 and 50 watt total power what I

1302
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,520
is 10 and 50 watt total power what I
 

1303
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,960
is 10 and 50 watt total power what I
don't see though is fast charge I don't

1304
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:30,970
don't see though is fast charge I don't
 

1305
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,730
don't see though is fast charge I don't
see that either and it's a good comment

1306
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:32,740
see that either and it's a good comment
 

1307
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,840
see that either and it's a good comment
because that's one of the questions

1308
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:33,850
because that's one of the questions
 

1309
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,820
because that's one of the questions
we're gonna get so ya know it looks like

1310
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:35,830
we're gonna get so ya know it looks like
 

1311
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,280
we're gonna get so ya know it looks like
it's just straight like just regular

1312
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,290
it's just straight like just regular
 

1313
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,190
it's just straight like just regular
regular charge power yep now this

1314
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
regular charge power yep now this
 

1315
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,049
regular charge power yep now this
particular one now I'm sure those exist

1316
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:43,059
particular one now I'm sure those exist
 

1317
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,270
particular one now I'm sure those exist
but I mean we're talking about charging

1318
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,280
but I mean we're talking about charging
 

1319
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,390
but I mean we're talking about charging
six devices simultaneously which is

1320
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,400
six devices simultaneously which is
 

1321
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,230
six devices simultaneously which is
pretty impressive

1322
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:49,240
pretty impressive
 

1323
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,480
pretty impressive
it's pretty good from a single power I

1324
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:51,490
it's pretty good from a single power I
 

1325
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,580
it's pretty good from a single power I
also like the stability of this one Jeff

1326
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:53,590
also like the stability of this one Jeff
 

1327
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,370
also like the stability of this one Jeff
it's very solid doesn't move now one

1328
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:56,380
it's very solid doesn't move now one
 

1329
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,290
it's very solid doesn't move now one
thing I noticed about the one that I had

1330
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:58,300
thing I noticed about the one that I had
 

1331
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,610
thing I noticed about the one that I had
at home for the life mate I can't think

1332
00:28:59,610 --> 00:28:59,620
at home for the life mate I can't think
 

1333
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,100
at home for the life mate I can't think
of the model or the brand that it is

1334
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,110
of the model or the brand that it is
 

1335
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,870
of the model or the brand that it is
there's an ally out there like tell

1336
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:03,880
there's an ally out there like tell
 

1337
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,460
there's an ally out there like tell
there's tons yeah search for them but

1338
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:05,470
there's tons yeah search for them but
 

1339
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,400
there's tons yeah search for them but
what I wanted to check with yours is the

1340
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,410
what I wanted to check with yours is the
 

1341
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:13,980
what I wanted to check with yours is the
gap between the placement spots so my

1342
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:13,990
gap between the placement spots so my
 

1343
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,130
gap between the placement spots so my
phone has a bit of a dip on the back

1344
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:17,140
phone has a bit of a dip on the back
 

1345
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,430
phone has a bit of a dip on the back
right where it yeah it is thicker and so

1346
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:20,440
right where it yeah it is thicker and so
 

1347
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,890
right where it yeah it is thicker and so
your phone sits quite nicely it's leaned

1348
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:22,900
your phone sits quite nicely it's leaned
 

1349
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,070
your phone sits quite nicely it's leaned
back when I put mine in because of that

1350
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
back when I put mine in because of that
 

1351
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,580
back when I put mine in because of that
it sits up doesn't very much okay does

1352
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:29,590
it sits up doesn't very much okay does
 

1353
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,020
it sits up doesn't very much okay does
that now I said matter

1354
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,030
that now I said matter
 

1355
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,750
that now I said matter
former bothers them well what it does

1356
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
former bothers them well what it does
 

1357
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,510
former bothers them well what it does
create a problem is if you if you're

00:29:59,460 --> 00:29:59,470
follow knocks them out so ok aware of
 

1379
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,020

that like all these things you wouldn't

1380
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,030
that like all these things you wouldn't
 

1381
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,750
that like all these things you wouldn't
even think about exactly because of the

1382
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
even think about exactly because of the
 

1383
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,430
even think about exactly because of the
the gap I mean that's that's finger

1384
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440
the gap I mean that's that's finger
 

1385
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,860
the gap I mean that's that's finger
width that's it so it's not like it's a

1386
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:07,870
width that's it so it's not like it's a
 

1387
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,230
width that's it so it's not like it's a
big gap if you have a table at your

1388
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240

2528
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:17,780
ability to go offline is what separates
 

2529
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,620
ability to go offline is what separates
the two oh yeah yeah but but maybe

2530
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:20,630
the two oh yeah yeah but but maybe
 

2531
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,900
the two oh yeah yeah but but maybe
that's the ideas that were never offline

2532
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:22,910
that's the ideas that were never offline
 

2533
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,450
that's the ideas that were never offline
anymore well and sure we are but do we

2534
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:25,460
anymore well and sure we are but do we
 

2535
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,849
anymore well and sure we are but do we
really but when we're at that point are

2536
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:27,859
really but when we're at that point are
 

2537
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:30,520
really but when we're at that point are
it's just we're always connected Jeff

dives 860
 

2545
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,650
dives 860
that's an assumption of necessary

2546
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:38,660
that's an assumption of necessary
 

2547
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,860
that's an assumption of necessary
connectivity I like we see this with our

2548
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:41,870
connectivity I like we see this with our
 

2549
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,170

kids all the time they play games that

2550
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:44,180

stuff but the difference here is yeah if

2562
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:58,190
stuff but the difference here is yeah if
 

2563
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,790
stuff but the difference here is yeah if

quality difference in the pricing and
 

2609
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,300
quality difference in the pricing and
ensure it's a different system and so it

2610
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:10,310
ensure it's a different system and so it
 

2611
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,190
ensure it's a different system and so it
is apples to oranges but what I mean is

2612
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:12,200
is apples to oranges but what I mean is
 

2613
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,640
is apples to oranges but what I mean is
the power of that more powerful system

2614
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:15,650
the power of that more powerful system
 

2615
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,920
the power of that more powerful system
even though my TV never changed

2616
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:17,930
even though my TV never changed
 

2617
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,210
even though my TV never changed
resolution it's still the same

2618
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:19,220
resolution it's still the same
 

2619
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,750

resolution the video quality is still
 

2621
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,690
resolution the video quality is still
the same right ok but it looks so much

2622
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:25,700
the same right ok but it looks so much
 

2623
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,300
the same right ok but it looks so much
better because that one is so much more

2624
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,310
better because that one is so much more
 

2625
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:31,360
better because that one is so much more
powerful so now take that and put it

2626
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:31,370
powerful so now take that and put it
 

2627
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:34,330
powerful so now take that and put it
into a cloud server where this cloud

2628
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:34,340
into a cloud server where this cloud
 

2629
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,450
into a cloud server where this cloud
server is still streaming 1920 by 1080 P

2630
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:37,460
server is still streaming 1920 by 1080 P
 

2631
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:43,900
server is still streaming 1920 by 1080 P
2 to my 1080p TV mhm and yet it has so

2632
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:43,910
2 to my 1080p TV mhm and yet it has so
 

2633
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,910
2 to my 1080p TV mhm and yet it has so
much power yes it's a

2634
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:45,920
much power yes it's a
 

2635
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,520
much power yes it's a
multibillion-dollar system

2636
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:48,530
multibillion-dollar system
 

2637
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,640
multibillion-dollar system
versus my little $400 right console

2638
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,650
versus my little $400 right console
 

2639
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,690
versus my little $400 right console
right so so the the the resolution is

2640
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:55,700
right so so the the the resolution is
 

2641
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:00,040
right so so the the the resolution is
not the bottleneck now our our Internet

2642
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,050
not the bottleneck now our our Internet
 

2643
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:03,130
not the bottleneck now our our Internet
is capable of streaming 4k video in real

2644
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:03,140
is capable of streaming 4k video in real
 

2645
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,140
is capable of streaming 4k video in real
time with no latency right that's

2646
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:05,150
time with no latency right that's
 

2647
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:05,980
time with no latency right that's
incredible

2648
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:05,990
incredible
 

2649
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,470
incredible
mm-hmm so now put it back and in there

2650
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:08,480
mm-hmm so now put it back and in there
 

2651
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,020
mm-hmm so now put it back and in there
that is so powerful that I can do that

2652
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:11,030
that is so powerful that I can do that
 

2653
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:13,330
that is so powerful that I can do that
on my cheap device yeah and on any

00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:23,030
and the transition is happening but the
 

2663
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,430
and the transition is happening but the
transitions going to be difficult for

2664
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:24,440
transitions going to be difficult for
 

2665
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,350
transitions going to be difficult for
people like me who still like to go to

2666
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:26,360
people like me who still like to go to
 

2667

games on stadia right yeah and that's

2684
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:53,060
games on stadia right yeah and that's
 

2685
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,060
games on stadia right yeah and that's
that's an interesting point I want to

2686
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:55,070
that's an interesting point I want to
 

2687
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,430
that's an interesting point I want to
just reiterate what you just said which

2688
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:57,440
just reiterate what you just said which
 

2689
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,210
just reiterate what you just said which
is I'm going to also play videos on

2690
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:01,220
is I'm going to also play videos on
 

2691
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,940
is I'm going to also play videos on
stadia stadia so I don't think that

2692
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:03,950
stadia stadia so I don't think that
 

2693
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,340
stadia stadia so I don't think that
we're replacing that offline phone

2694
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:06,350
we're replacing that offline phone
 

2695
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,140
we're replacing that offline phone
device I think we're supplementing it

2696
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,150
device I think we're supplementing it
 

2697
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,840
device I think we're supplementing it
and say it enhance hey now okay you can

2698
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:10,850
and say it enhance hey now okay you can
 

2699
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,760
and say it enhance hey now okay you can
you can also when you're connected to

2700
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:12,770
you can also when you're connected to
 

2701
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,620
you can also when you're connected to
the internet play games that you can't

2702
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:14,630
the internet play games that you can't
 

2703
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,480
the internet play games that you can't
play when you're offline that are like

2704
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:16,490
play when you're offline that are like
 

2705
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,140
play when you're offline that are like
high-end

2706
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:17,150
high-end
 

2707
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,720
high-end
yeah and that's where okay maybe this is

2708
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:19,730
yeah and that's where okay maybe this is
 

2709
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:22,930
yeah and that's where okay maybe this is
just another another platform and we all

2710
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:22,940
just another another platform and we all
 

2711
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,820
just another another platform and we all
have multiple plans that's right yeah I

2712
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:24,830
have multiple plans that's right yeah I
 

2713
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,550
have multiple plans that's right yeah I
wonder if they'll have it like now

2714
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:27,560
wonder if they'll have it like now
 

2715
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,250
wonder if they'll have it like now
here's the latency is too high for VR

2716
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:30,260
here's the latency is too high for VR
 

2717
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,320
here's the latency is too high for VR
here's an eye we have got to be able

2718
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:32,330
here's an eye we have got to be able
 

2719
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,670
here's an eye we have got to be able
it's gotta be able to track you with

2720
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:33,680
it's gotta be able to track you with
 

2721
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,370
it's gotta be able to track you with
this right now so I mean like you've

2722
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:36,380
this right now so I mean like you've
 

2723
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,100
this right now so I mean like you've
brought up VR which you know totally

2724
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:39,110
brought up VR which you know totally
 

2725
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:43,210
brought up VR which you know totally
make sense yes what about things like

2726
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:43,220
make sense yes what about things like
 

2727
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,070
make sense yes what about things like
framerate

2728
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:45,080
framerate
 

2729
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,800
framerate
because you said 64k that's pretty good

2730
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:47,810
because you said 64k that's pretty good
 

2731
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:51,490
because you said 64k that's pretty good
to me yeah I hear you but you're talking

2732
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:51,500
to me yeah I hear you but you're talking
 

2733
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,020
to me yeah I hear you but you're talking
about the screen resolution I mean if

2734
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,030
about the screen resolution I mean if
 

2735
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:56,110
about the screen resolution I mean if
your internet can't keep up it's gonna

2736
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:56,120
your internet can't keep up it's gonna
 

2737
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,640
your internet can't keep up it's gonna
impact your gameplay do you remember

2738
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:57,650
impact your gameplay do you remember
 

2739
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,560
impact your gameplay do you remember
when we used to be like oh I'm like I'm

2740
01:00:59,560 --> 01:00:59,570
when we used to be like oh I'm like I'm
 

2741
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:03,010
when we used to be like oh I'm like I'm
so bad yeah like in order to go back to

2742
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:03,020
so bad yeah like in order to go back to

2745
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,610
lagging or my car my kids gonna go yes
however consider this as and I know we

2746
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:09,620
however consider this as and I know we
 

2747
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,380
however consider this as and I know we
do need to move on to the next story but

2748
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:11,390
do need to move on to the next story but
 

2749
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,990
do need to move on to the next story but
consider that the very companies that

2750
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
consider that the very companies that
 

2751
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,140
consider that the very companies that
are pushing the technology shift are the

2752
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:17,150
are pushing the technology shift are the
 

2753
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,900
are pushing the technology shift are the
same companies who are controlling the

2754

introduction of like Google's gigabit

2756
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:22,790
introduction of like Google's gigabit
 

2757
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:26,950
introduction of like Google's gigabit
fiber to the home right right so yeah if

2758
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:26,960
fiber to the home right right so yeah if
 

2759
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,170
fiber to the home right right so yeah if
that's the case oh you know it's gonna

2760
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:29,180
that's the case oh you know it's gonna
 

2761
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,990
that's the case oh you know it's gonna
perform well it's like you you you just

2762
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,000
perform well it's like you you you just
 

2763
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,220
perform well it's like you you you just
know that that's what they're driving

2764
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,230
know that that's what they're driving
 

2765
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,010
know that that's what they're driving
toward and and they're not gonna build a

2766
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,020
toward and and they're not gonna build a
 

2767
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,740
toward and and they're not gonna build a

01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,140
like ridiculous amounts of data having
to do with AI right so that so the next

3232
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,150
to do with AI right so that so the next
 

3233
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:48,760
to do with AI right so that so the next
thing is that the you know coders will

3234
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:48,770
thing is that the you know coders will
 

3235
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:52,540
thing is that the you know coders will
be able to make thinking devices so

01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:58,660
those smart speakers with this and with
this technology will be smarter the fact

3240
01:11:58,660 --> 01:11:58,670
this technology will be smarter the fact
 

3241
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,610
this technology will be smarter the fact
that there are two separate things like

I'm surprised that well you have to have
 

3245
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,120
I'm surprised that well you have to have
a CPU you have to have the ability to

01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:04,130
a CPU you have to have the ability to
 

3247
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,880
a CPU you have to have the ability to
run traditional code yeah otherwise you

3248
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:06,890
run traditional code yeah otherwise you
 

3249
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:08,290
run traditional code yeah otherwise you
wouldn't be able to like you wouldn't be

3250
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:08,300
wouldn't be able to like you wouldn't be
 

3251
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,210
wouldn't be able to like you wouldn't be

3253
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,910

3255
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,640
there has to be a layer for humans to be

3256
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:15,650
able to access the NPU yeah hmm
 

3257
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:19,510
able to access the NPU yeah hmm
otherwise it just blow our minds how

3258
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,520
otherwise it just blow our minds how
 

3259
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,250

but I mean at this level

3264
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:28,290
but I mean at this level

I don't know like because that could

01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,380
change mobile computing sure it's gonna
change a lot of sauce but the idea is

3270
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:36,390
change a lot of sauce but the idea is
 

3271
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,110
change a lot of sauce but the idea is
that it's getting faster smaller yeah

3272
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
that it's getting faster smaller yeah
 

3273
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,870
that it's getting faster smaller yeah
and more integrated that's the way

3274

technology goes and so we're seeing a
 

3277
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:48,920
technology goes and so we're seeing a

01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:25,630
instance of this type of hack it is it
 

3395
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:28,439
instance of this type of hack it is it
very well may not be the last and points

3396
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:28,449
very well may not be the last and points
 

3397
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:31,140
very well may not be the last and points
to a need for Microsoft to reassess the

01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:31,150
to a need for Microsoft to reassess the
 

3399
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:33,169
to a need for Microsoft to reassess the
way their certificate revocation

3400
01:15:33,169 --> 01:15:33,179
way their certificate revocation
 

3401
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:38,100
way their certificate revocation
procedures hmm that's tough mm-hmm

3402
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,110
procedures hmm that's tough mm-hmm
 

3403
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,959
procedures hmm that's tough mm-hmm
because the the part of me wants to say

3404
01:15:39,959 --> 01:15:39,969
because the the part of me wants to say
 

3405
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:42,030
because the the part of me wants to say
Oh we'll just revoke the certificate

3406
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:42,040
Oh we'll just revoke the certificate
 

3407
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,850
Oh we'll just revoke the certificate
anytime there's an exploit but remember

3408
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:44,860
anytime there's an exploit but remember
 

3409
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:48,450
anytime there's an exploit but remember
that then that would nullify everybody's

3410
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:48,460
that then that would nullify everybody's
 

3411
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:53,399
that then that would nullify everybody's
drivers right so this is all mole I mean

3412
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:53,409
drivers right so this is all mole I mean
 

3413
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:56,850
drivers right so this is all mole I mean
as I'm hearing it this is like a new

3414
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:56,860
as I'm hearing it this is like a new
 

3415
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,580
as I'm hearing it this is like a new
wave of Trojan attacks so to speak yeah

3416
01:15:59,580 --> 01:15:59,590
wave of Trojan attacks so to speak yeah
 

3417
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,580
wave of Trojan attacks so to speak yeah
that's what it feels like like you're

3418
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:02,590
that's what it feels like like you're
 

3419
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:07,379
that's what it feels like like you're
coming in through yeah trusted source to

3420
01:16:07,379 --> 01:16:07,389
coming in through yeah trusted source to
 

3421
01:16:07,389 --> 01:16:10,550
coming in through yeah trusted source to
get access is that not the basic

3422
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
get access is that not the basic
 

3423
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,189
get access is that not the basic
principle of behind it or is it a whole

3424
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:14,199
principle of behind it or is it a whole
 

3425
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:15,990
principle of behind it or is it a whole
different wave just feels like so

3426
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:16,000
different wave just feels like so
 

3427
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,850
different wave just feels like so
they're using it as an elevated

3428
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:17,860
they're using it as an elevated
 

3429
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:22,250
they're using it as an elevated
privilege tactic so they're using a

3430
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:22,260
privilege tactic so they're using a
 

3431
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,620
privilege tactic so they're using a
driver that windows trusts because of

3432
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:25,630
driver that windows trusts because of
 

3433
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:29,310
driver that windows trusts because of
the signature being valid so it's not a

3434
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:29,320
the signature being valid so it's not a
 

3435
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,129
the signature being valid so it's not a
fake driver it's not like a malware it

3436
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:32,139
fake driver it's not like a malware it
 

3437
01:16:32,139 --> 01:16:34,439
fake driver it's not like a malware it
is a legitimate driver but it has a bug

3438
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:34,449
is a legitimate driver but it has a bug
 

3439
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:36,600
is a legitimate driver but it has a bug
in it mm-hmm that caused it to be

3440
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:36,610
in it mm-hmm that caused it to be
 

3441
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:39,450
in it mm-hmm that caused it to be
recalled basically but the Windows

3442
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:39,460
recalled basically but the Windows
 

3443
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,220
recalled basically but the Windows
operating system no matter what version

3444
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:41,230
operating system no matter what version
 

3445
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,530
operating system no matter what version
you're running still trusts the

3446
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:43,540
you're running still trusts the
 

3447
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,750
you're running still trusts the
Installer for that driver because of the

3448
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
Installer for that driver because of the
 

3449
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,709
Installer for that driver because of the
certificate that is applied to it

3450
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
certificate that is applied to it
 

3451
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,410
certificate that is applied to it
and so the hackers are using that to

3452
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:51,420
and so the hackers are using that to
 

3453
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,419
and so the hackers are using that to
then be able to elevate their privileges

3454
01:16:53,419 --> 01:16:53,429
then be able to elevate their privileges
 

3455
01:16:53,429 --> 01:16:55,489
then be able to elevate their privileges
and do whatever the heck they want and

3456
01:16:55,489 --> 01:16:55,499
and do whatever the heck they want and
 

3457
01:16:55,499 --> 01:16:57,680
and do whatever the heck they want and
that's the scary thing because how do

3458
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:57,690
that's the scary thing because how do
 

3459
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,469
that's the scary thing because how do
you stop that how can you possibly stop

3460
01:17:00,469 --> 01:17:00,479
you stop that how can you possibly stop
 

3461
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,609
you stop that how can you possibly stop
that I think it comes down to where's

3462
01:17:04,609 --> 01:17:04,619
that I think it comes down to where's
 

3463
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:07,069
that I think it comes down to where's
your first line of defense I think the

3464
01:17:07,069 --> 01:17:07,079
your first line of defense I think the
 

3465
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:08,810
your first line of defense I think the
only thing you have to that you can look

3466
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:08,820
only thing you have to that you can look
 

3467
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,850
only thing you have to that you can look
at is how did they get in in the first

3468
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:10,860
at is how did they get in in the first
 

3469
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,419
at is how did they get in in the first
place

3470
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:11,429
place
 

3471
01:17:11,429 --> 01:17:13,609
place
was it a phishing scam was it somebody

3472
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:13,619
was it a phishing scam was it somebody
 

3473
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:15,259
was it a phishing scam was it somebody
clicked on an email that had some file

3474
01:17:15,259 --> 01:17:15,269
clicked on an email that had some file
 

3475
01:17:15,269 --> 01:17:16,850
clicked on an email that had some file
list malware that allowed somebody to

01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:16,860
list malware that allowed somebody to
 

3477
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,589
list malware that allowed somebody to
run something resident in their computer

3478
01:17:18,589 --> 01:17:18,599
run something resident in their computer
 

3479
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:20,379
run something resident in their computer
is it that you have Remote Desktop

3480
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:20,389
is it that you have Remote Desktop
 

3481
01:17:20,389 --> 01:17:22,910
is it that you have Remote Desktop
turned on on one of your computers on

3482
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:22,920
turned on on one of your computers on
 

3483
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,979
turned on on one of your computers on
your network and that's really easy to

3484
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:24,989
your network and that's really easy to
 

3485
01:17:24,989 --> 01:17:27,410
your network and that's really easy to
hack now I don't know how certificates

3486
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:27,420
hack now I don't know how certificates
 

3487
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,719
hack now I don't know how certificates
work just because I haven't delved into

3488
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:29,729
work just because I haven't delved into
 

3489
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,270
work just because I haven't delved into
that but does each certificate in each

3490
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:32,280
that but does each certificate in each
 

3491
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,910
that but does each certificate in each
driver have its own like certificate

3492
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:34,920
driver have its own like certificate
 

3493
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,239
driver have its own like certificate
identifier no the driver doesn't have

3494
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:38,249
identifier no the driver doesn't have
 

3495
01:17:38,249 --> 01:17:40,640
identifier no the driver doesn't have
its own certificate but the company that

3496
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:40,650
its own certificate but the company that
 

3497
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:43,069
its own certificate but the company that
manufactures the driver does so that

3498
01:17:43,069 --> 01:17:43,079
manufactures the driver does so that
 

3499
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:47,209
manufactures the driver does so that
certificate says yes to Microsoft this

3500
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:47,219
certificate says yes to Microsoft this
 

3501
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:51,979
certificate says yes to Microsoft this
is a gigabyte driver provided by

3502
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:51,989
is a gigabyte driver provided by
 

3503
01:17:51,989 --> 01:17:53,779
is a gigabyte driver provided by
gigabyte because it contains the

3504
01:17:53,779 --> 01:17:53,789
gigabyte because it contains the
 

3505
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:56,359
gigabyte because it contains the
certificate that proves that this is a

3506
01:17:56,359 --> 01:17:56,369
certificate that proves that this is a
 

3507
01:17:56,369 --> 01:17:58,700
certificate that proves that this is a
legitimate driver from gigabyte so what

3508
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:58,710
legitimate driver from gigabyte so what
 

3509
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:00,680
legitimate driver from gigabyte so what
if the certificate system changed in

3510
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:00,690
if the certificate system changed in
 

3511
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,500
if the certificate system changed in
such a way that you have your your main

3512
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:03,510
such a way that you have your your main
 

3513
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:05,689
such a way that you have your your main
certificate say for gigabyte but then

3514
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:05,699
certificate say for gigabyte but then
 

3515
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:07,279
certificate say for gigabyte but then
you have your sub certificates for each

3516
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:07,289
you have your sub certificates for each
 

3517
01:18:07,289 --> 01:18:10,520
you have your sub certificates for each
driver roll out so that

3518
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:10,530
driver roll out so that
 

3519
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:14,149
driver roll out so that
it identifies this drivers this subset

3520
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:14,159
it identifies this drivers this subset
 

3521
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:19,040
it identifies this drivers this subset
yeah developer I feel like that's your

3522
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:19,050
yeah developer I feel like that's your
 

3523
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,839
yeah developer I feel like that's your
you're giving me nightmares right now

3524
01:18:20,839 --> 01:18:20,849
you're giving me nightmares right now
 

3525
01:18:20,849 --> 01:18:25,189
you're giving me nightmares right now
Jeff okay I like where you're going but

3526
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:25,199
Jeff okay I like where you're going but
 

3527
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,930
Jeff okay I like where you're going but
it just sounds like a logistical

3528
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:26,940
it just sounds like a logistical
 

3529
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,850
it just sounds like a logistical
nightmare as far as managing those

3530
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:28,860
nightmare as far as managing those
 

3531
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:30,140
nightmare as far as managing those
certificates like it could just be a

3532
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:30,150
certificates like it could just be a
 

3533
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:34,149
certificates like it could just be a
nightmare I think maybe some kind of an

3534
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:34,159
nightmare I think maybe some kind of an
 

3535
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,640
nightmare I think maybe some kind of an
aristocrat is able to identify maybe

3536
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:37,650
aristocrat is able to identify maybe
 

3537
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,919
aristocrat is able to identify maybe
it's a checksum that identifies known

3538
01:18:39,919 --> 01:18:39,929
it's a checksum that identifies known
 

3539
01:18:39,929 --> 01:18:43,010
it's a checksum that identifies known
faulty drivers or deprecated drivers so

3540
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,020
faulty drivers or deprecated drivers so
 

3541
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,569
faulty drivers or deprecated drivers so
that Windows could say yes this is a

3542
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:44,579
that Windows could say yes this is a
 

3543
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:47,540
that Windows could say yes this is a
valid certificate however gigabyte has

3544
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:47,550
