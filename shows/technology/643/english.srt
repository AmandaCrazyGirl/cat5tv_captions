132
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:14,439
so here it is this is the Canlis air
 

133
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,349
so here it is this is the Canlis air
system I've got the X 3 hurricane thank

134
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:16,359
system I've got the X 3 hurricane thank
 

135
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,640
system I've got the X 3 hurricane thank
you very much John for sending that to

136
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:17,650
you very much John for sending that to
 

137
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,149
you very much John for sending that to
us yes that's right and so what I want

138
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:21,159
us yes that's right and so what I want
 

139
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,479
us yes that's right and so what I want
to show you is that the footprint

140
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,489
to show you is that the footprint
 

141
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,180
to show you is that the footprint
between a can of canned compressed air

142
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,190
between a can of canned compressed air
 

143
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,000
between a can of canned compressed air
and the camless air is roughly the same

144
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,010
and the camless air is roughly the same
 

145
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,729
and the camless air is roughly the same
so on a shelf this is virtually the same

146
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:34,739
so on a shelf this is virtually the same
 

147
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,140
so on a shelf this is virtually the same
but when I think about like what I want

148
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,150
but when I think about like what I want
 

149
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,149
but when I think about like what I want
to what I want to use if I'm

150
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:39,159
to what I want to use if I'm
 

151
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,399
to what I want to use if I'm
environmentally conscious is something

152
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:41,409
environmentally conscious is something
 

153
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,649
environmentally conscious is something
like a compressor right right which

154
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:43,659
like a compressor right right which
 

155
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,420
like a compressor right right which
takes up a massive amount of space

156
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,430
takes up a massive amount of space
 

157
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,409
takes up a massive amount of space
compared to something like this or this

158
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:48,419
compared to something like this or this
 

159
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,599
compared to something like this or this
why does it really matter and and maybe

160
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:51,609
why does it really matter and and maybe
 

161
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,490
why does it really matter and and maybe
before I even ask that question John I

162
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:53,500
before I even ask that question John I
 

163
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,819
before I even ask that question John I
think I mentioned at the top of our

164
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:55,829
think I mentioned at the top of our
 

165
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,770
think I mentioned at the top of our
discussion here as a computer geek

166
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:58,780
discussion here as a computer geek
 

167
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,379
discussion here as a computer geek
myself as a computer user and a

168
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:01,389
myself as a computer user and a
 

169
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,689
myself as a computer user and a
technician I'm always using this kind of

170
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:03,699
technician I'm always using this kind of
 

171
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,219
technician I'm always using this kind of
thing that the compressed the

172
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:05,229
thing that the compressed the
 

173
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:08,640
thing that the compressed the
traditional compressed air and I never

174
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:08,650
traditional compressed air and I never
 

175
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,750
traditional compressed air and I never
think twice about it

176
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
think twice about it
 

177
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,080
think twice about it
ok so consider that like that's readily

178
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,090
ok so consider that like that's readily
 

179
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,490
ok so consider that like that's readily
available I can pick that up at any

180
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:14,500
available I can pick that up at any
 

181
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,860
available I can pick that up at any
ready shop and any computer shop is

182
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:16,870
ready shop and any computer shop is
 

183
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,379
ready shop and any computer shop is
selling that and as a computer guy I've

184
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:19,389
selling that and as a computer guy I've
 

185
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,569
selling that and as a computer guy I've
never thought twice about it

186
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:21,579
never thought twice about it
 

187
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,510
never thought twice about it
and then along comes Canlis air system

188
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,520
and then along comes Canlis air system
 

189
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,230
and then along comes Canlis air system
and starts to make me think

190
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,240
and starts to make me think
 

191
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,230
and starts to make me think
well maybe I should be thinking about

192
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
well maybe I should be thinking about
 

193
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,059
well maybe I should be thinking about
the environmental impact can you tell us

194
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:32,069
the environmental impact can you tell us
 

195
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,189
the environmental impact can you tell us
a little bit about what is dangerous

196
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:34,199
a little bit about what is dangerous
 

197
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,749
a little bit about what is dangerous
about these like compressed air dusters

198
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:38,759
about these like compressed air dusters
 

199
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,070
about these like compressed air dusters
and and and how the products differ well

200
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
and and and how the products differ well
 

201
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,510
and and and how the products differ well

it it runs for a long time mm-hmm it
 

223
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,860
it it runs for a long time mm-hmm it
doesn't freeze up because that can of

224
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:18,870
doesn't freeze up because that can of
 

225
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,050
doesn't freeze up because that can of
canned air has dangerous chemicals in it

226

and if did you use canned air and your
 

229
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,140
and if did you use canned air and your
camera lenses yeah I've used it on

230
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,150
camera lenses yeah I've used it on
 

231
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,290
camera lenses yeah I've used it on
camera lenses on computer keyboards on

232
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:30,300
camera lenses on computer keyboards on
 

233
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,499

servers on the inside outside everything
 

235
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:36,409
servers on the inside outside everything
yeah I hope that you won't use canned

236
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:36,419
yeah I hope that you won't use canned
 

237
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,749
yeah I hope that you won't use canned
air anymore because one of the worst

238
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:38,759
air anymore because one of the worst
 

239
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,930
air anymore because one of the worst
things to use canned air on camera

240
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:41,940
things to use canned air on camera
 

241
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,450
things to use canned air on camera
lenses you could ruin the lens really

242
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,460
lenses you could ruin the lens really
 

243
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,730
lenses you could ruin the lens really
because you know how candy or sometimes

244
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:46,740
because you know how candy or sometimes
 

245
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,730

spits out liquid yeah that's a concern
 

247
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,890
spits out liquid yeah that's a concern
for me on the inside of a computer or

248
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:51,900
for me on the inside of a computer or
 

249
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,360
for me on the inside of a computer or
something I think about yes if it gets

250
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,370
something I think about yes if it gets
 

251
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,040
something I think about yes if it gets
well of it for sure if it gets on a

of camera people buying our product
 

261
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,649
of camera people buying our product
because it's safe yeah it's just blowing

262
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:06,659
because it's safe yeah it's just blowing
 

263
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:09,230
because it's safe yeah it's just blowing
air it's just you know air coming out of

264
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,240
air it's just you know air coming out of
 

265
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,629
air it's just you know air coming out of
here and you can turn it upside down or

266
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:11,639
here and you can turn it upside down or
 

267
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,909
here and you can turn it upside down or
sideways it doesn't matter not if you

268
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
sideways it doesn't matter not if you
 

269
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,779
sideways it doesn't matter not if you
have you ever turned the can deer upside

270
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:17,789
have you ever turned the can deer upside
 

271
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,520
have you ever turned the can deer upside
down uh-huh that's when the liquid comes

272
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:19,530
down uh-huh that's when the liquid comes
 

273
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,020

the liquid comes out you're correct yeah
 

277
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,999
the liquid comes out you're correct yeah
and so and and it freezes up you know

278
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:26,009
and so and and it freezes up you know
 

279
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,879
and so and and it freezes up you know
that you that can after a while gets

280
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:28,889
that you that can after a while gets
 

281
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,700
that you that can after a while gets
very cold yeah what causes that John

282
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:31,710
very cold yeah what causes that John
 

283
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,839
very cold yeah what causes that John
that's the chemicals in there and

284
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:34,849
that's the chemicals in there and
 

285
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,760
that's the chemicals in there and
turning it upside down if you sprayed it

286
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:37,770
turning it upside down if you sprayed it
 

287
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,950
turning it upside down if you sprayed it
on you can get frostbite from if you

288
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
on you can get frostbite from if you
 

289
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,570
on you can get frostbite from if you
turn it upside down to spread it on your

290
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:42,580
turn it upside down to spread it on your
 

291
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,659
turn it upside down to spread it on your
skin for a little bit you can get

292
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:45,669
skin for a little bit you can get
 

293
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,499
skin for a little bit you can get
frostbite

294

frostbite
 

295
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:50,490
frostbite
so there's many reasons that I developed

296
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:50,500
so there's many reasons that I developed
 

297
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,920
so there's many reasons that I developed
this product I mean there's the green

298
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:52,930
this product I mean there's the green
 

299
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,439
this product I mean there's the green
aspect there's a safety aspect for sure

300
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:55,449
aspect there's a safety aspect for sure
 

301
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,740
aspect there's a safety aspect for sure
and people didn't have a choice they

302
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:58,750
and people didn't have a choice they
 

303
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,379
and people didn't have a choice they
they had no choice and so that's why

304
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:01,389
they had no choice and so that's why
 

305
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,499
they had no choice and so that's why
this got developed and and I made it Y

306
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:04,509
this got developed and and I made it Y
 

307
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,029
this got developed and and I made it Y
heard you mention about the size the

308
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:06,039
heard you mention about the size the
 

309
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,360
heard you mention about the size the
same size of the denim can there that's

310
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,370
same size of the denim can there that's
 

311
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,210
same size of the denim can there that's
what we did we had the engineers hold

312
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,220
what we did we had the engineers hold
 

313
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,310
what we did we had the engineers hold
canned air in their hand and then design

314
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,320
canned air in their hand and then design
 

315
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,770
canned air in their hand and then design
this and it's designed for a woman's

316
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:16,780
this and it's designed for a woman's
 

317
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,800
this and it's designed for a woman's

00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:57,830

 

631
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,980

it's not the same thing it's not the

632
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:00,990
it's not the same thing it's not the
 

633
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,800
it's not the same thing it's not the
same thing I read that the other day we

634
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:03,810
same thing I read that the other day we
 

635
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,260
same thing I read that the other day we
can't problem with this is we can't get

636
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,270
can't problem with this is we can't get
 

637
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,560
can't problem with this is we can't get
high off of it oh you can't see it's

638
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:09,570
high off of it oh you can't see it's
 

639
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,960
high off of it oh you can't see it's
just it's taking an error in these vents

640
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:11,970
just it's taking an error in these vents
 

641
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,060
just it's taking an error in these vents
right I mean that's here and blowing it

642
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,070
right I mean that's here and blowing it
 

643
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,870
right I mean that's here and blowing it
out this here is the same if your room

644
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
out this here is the same if your room
 

645
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,720
out this here is the same if your room
is full of hot air which I assume your

646
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:20,730
is full of hot air which I assume your
 

647
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,540
is full of hot air which I assume your
room is there guys a lot of hot air and

648
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,550
room is there guys a lot of hot air and
 

649
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,970
room is there guys a lot of hot air and
you pull the trigger hands down and if

650
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:25,980
you pull the trigger hands down and if
 

651
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,640
you pull the trigger hands down and if
it blow out hot air I'll kick that it

652
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:31,650
it blow out hot air I'll kick that it
 

653
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,009
it blow out hot air I'll kick that it
just

654
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:32,019
just
 

655
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,329
just
whatever's in the room alright let's

656
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:33,339
whatever's in the room alright let's
 

657
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,069
whatever's in the room alright let's
give it the ultimate test the X 3

658
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:35,079
give it the ultimate test the X 3
 

659
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,720
give it the ultimate test the X 3
hurricane Canlis air system with the

660
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:36,730
hurricane Canlis air system with the
 

661
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,030
hurricane Canlis air system with the
variable speed control on my anemometer

662
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
variable speed control on my anemometer
 

663
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,790
variable speed control on my anemometer
and I'm gonna start at the very lowest

664
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:41,800
and I'm gonna start at the very lowest
 

665
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,979
and I'm gonna start at the very lowest
speed and gradually work my way up from

666
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:43,989
speed and gradually work my way up from
 

667
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:48,139
speed and gradually work my way up from
there so hitting about 910 up 12 20

668
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:48,149
there so hitting about 910 up 12 20
 

669
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:54,030
there so hitting about 910 up 12 20
almost 30 kilometres an hour oh and you

670
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,040
almost 30 kilometres an hour oh and you
 

671
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,919
almost 30 kilometres an hour oh and you
see that it kind of dropped way down and

672
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:55,929
see that it kind of dropped way down and
 

673
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,650
see that it kind of dropped way down and
then start it up again they almost like

674
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:58,660
then start it up again they almost like
 

675
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,710
then start it up again they almost like
it switched into second gear ok

676
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:01,720
it switched into second gear ok
 

677
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,929
it switched into second gear ok
increasing let's hit 50 kilometres an

678
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:03,939
increasing let's hit 50 kilometres an
 

679
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:07,470
increasing let's hit 50 kilometres an
hour almost there oh and you see there

680
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,480
hour almost there oh and you see there
 

681
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,699
hour almost there oh and you see there
it goes again so now we're in like a

682
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:08,709
it goes again so now we're in like a
 

683
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,109
it goes again so now we're in like a
third gear so there's some kind of

684
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:10,119
third gear so there's some kind of
 

685
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,929
third gear so there's some kind of
gearing mechanism in there and my

686
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:12,939
gearing mechanism in there and my
 

687
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,549
gearing mechanism in there and my
anemometer can only go up to 90

688
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:14,559
anemometer can only go up to 90
 

689
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,289
anemometer can only go up to 90
kilometers an hour

690
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:16,299
kilometers an hour
 

691
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,900
kilometers an hour
we're probably gonna hit that oh there

692
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:18,910
we're probably gonna hit that oh there
 

693
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,949
we're probably gonna hit that oh there
we go 96

694
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:19,959
we go 96
 

695
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,569
we go 96
I guess Wow a hundred so I guess the

696
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:24,579
I guess Wow a hundred so I guess the
 

697
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,549
I guess Wow a hundred so I guess the
anemometer is reading higher than its

698
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:26,559
anemometer is reading higher than its
 

699
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,359
anemometer is reading higher than its
limit but it's probably inaccurate at

700
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:30,369
limit but it's probably inaccurate at
 

701
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:33,869
limit but it's probably inaccurate at
this point hitting one hundred and 1.5

702
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:33,879
this point hitting one hundred and 1.5
 

703
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,289
this point hitting one hundred and 1.5
kilometers per hour and capping off so I

704
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:37,299
kilometers per hour and capping off so I
 

705
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,449
kilometers per hour and capping off so I
think that's all my anemometer is

706
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:39,459
think that's all my anemometer is
 

707
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,850
think that's all my anemometer is
capable of but obviously we're getting

708
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:41,860
capable of but obviously we're getting
 

709
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,309
capable of but obviously we're getting
over 100 kilometres an hour wind off of

710
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:44,319
over 100 kilometres an hour wind off of
 

711
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,340
over 100 kilometres an hour wind off of
the x3 hurricane now John one of the

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,350
the x3 hurricane now John one of the

00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:49,089
questions we have from our chat room is
 

715
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,929
questions we have from our chat room is
they're wondering after you've expended

716
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:51,939
they're wondering after you've expended
 

717
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:55,710
they're wondering after you've expended
the 500 charges is there a way to extend

718
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:55,720
the 500 charges is there a way to extend
 

719
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,749
the 500 charges is there a way to extend
the life of the product by a replacement

720
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
the life of the product by a replacement
 

721
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,410
the life of the product by a replacement
battery no how long do they want this to

722
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:01,420
battery no how long do they want this to
 

723
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,000
battery no how long do they want this to
last I think the rest of their life

724
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,010
last I think the rest of their life
 

725
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:10,319

indefinitely John 500 times just to give

726
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,329
indefinitely John 500 times just to give
 

727
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,199

you an idea around the house people that

728
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,209
you an idea around the house people that
 

729
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,059
you an idea around the house people that
have these I have these around my house

730
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,069
have these I have these around my house
 

731
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,350
have these I have these around my house
yeah around the house if you charge it

732
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
yeah around the house if you charge it
 

733
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,909
yeah around the house if you charge it
once a month that's probably a lot right

734
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:22,919
once a month that's probably a lot right
 

735
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,059
once a month that's probably a lot right
so let's say you charge it once a month

736
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:26,069
so let's say you charge it once a month
 

737
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,480
so let's say you charge it once a month
so 12 times a year and it's good for 500

738
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,490
so 12 times a year and it's good for 500
 

739
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,269
so 12 times a year and it's good for 500
times that's gonna do that well how old

740
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:33,279
times that's gonna do that well how old
 

741
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,139
times that's gonna do that well how old
are they gonna be that's that's quite

742
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:37,149
are they gonna be that's that's quite
 

743
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:37,529
are they gonna be that's that's quite
old

744
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:37,539
old
 

745
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:41,850
old
ah so how so no we this thing is sealed

746
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:41,860
ah so how so no we this thing is sealed
 

747
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,980
ah so how so no we this thing is sealed
the batteries in there it's not a it's

748
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:43,990
the batteries in there it's not a it's
 

749
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,500
the batteries in there it's not a it's
not take the batteries

750
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,510
not take the batteries
 

751
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,780
not take the batteries
with other batteries in these are

752
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:47,790
with other batteries in these are
 

753
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,650
with other batteries in these are
high-end batteries that we use in here

754
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:50,660
high-end batteries that we use in here
 

755
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,180
high-end batteries that we use in here
we were talking about the other day in

756
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,190
we were talking about the other day in
 

757
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,790
we were talking about the other day in
the office and we said it took us a

758
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:55,800
the office and we said it took us a
 

759
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,910
the office and we said it took us a
while to perfect this and get the right

760
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:57,920
while to perfect this and get the right
 

761
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,200
while to perfect this and get the right
combination between the battery the

762
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,210
combination between the battery the
 

763
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,560
combination between the battery the
charger and the motor the battery we

764
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:03,570
charger and the motor the battery we
 

765
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,950
charger and the motor the battery we
have is just it's unbelievable Fantauzzo

end-of-life we all have this situation

960
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,070
end-of-life we all have this situation
 

961
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,120
end-of-life we all have this situation
if we use Windows on our network that

962
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,130
if we use Windows on our network that
 

963
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,870
if we use Windows on our network that
well the operating system is now

964
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:05,880
well the operating system is now
 

965
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,490
well the operating system is now
depreciated it's no longer safe to use

966
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:08,500
depreciated it's no longer safe to use
 

967
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,620
depreciated it's no longer safe to use
Windows 7 that's right that's go say

968
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:10,630
Windows 7 that's right that's go say
 

969
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,830
Windows 7 that's right that's go say
hasn't been appreciated for a long time

970
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:12,840
hasn't been appreciated for a long time
 

971
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,080
hasn't been appreciated for a long time
well Windows 7 is is now what we call

972
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,090
well Windows 7 is is now what we call
 

973
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,110
well Windows 7 is is now what we call
end-of-life and and some folks have said

974
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,120
end-of-life and and some folks have said
 

975
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,269
end-of-life and and some folks have said
well I don't need Microsoft support I've

976
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:21,279
well I don't need Microsoft support I've
 

977
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,779
well I don't need Microsoft support I've
never once in my entire Windows usage

978
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:24,789
never once in my entire Windows usage
 

979
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,930
never once in my entire Windows usage
never required Microsoft support sorry

980
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:27,940
never required Microsoft support sorry
 

981
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,789
never required Microsoft support sorry
and I'm all tangled up here there we go

982
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:29,799
and I'm all tangled up here there we go
 

983
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,610
and I'm all tangled up here there we go
now I'm better so if you do if you don't

984
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:32,620
now I'm better so if you do if you don't
 

985
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,129
now I'm better so if you do if you don't
ever have to call Microsoft support why

986
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:35,139
ever have to call Microsoft support why
 

987
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:37,649
ever have to call Microsoft support why
does it matter to you if Microsoft no

988
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:37,659
does it matter to you if Microsoft no
 

989
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:42,990
does it matter to you if Microsoft no
longer supports Windows 7 well yeah yeah

990
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,000
longer supports Windows 7 well yeah yeah
 

991
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,440
longer supports Windows 7 well yeah yeah
so consider this that support so when we

992
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,450
so consider this that support so when we
 

993
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,669
so consider this that support so when we
think of support we think about being

994
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
think of support we think about being
 

995
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,930
think of support we think about being
able to pick up the phone and call

996
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:48,940
able to pick up the phone and call
 

997
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
able to pick up the phone and call
technical support well that's not at all

998
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:50,950
technical support well that's not at all
 

999
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,529
technical support well that's not at all
what it's talking about

1000
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:52,539
what it's talking about
 

1001
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,600
what it's talking about
what it's talking about is that the

1002
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:54,610
what it's talking about is that the
 

1003
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,399
what it's talking about is that the
support of basically them fixing

1004
00:23:59,399 --> 00:23:59,409
support of basically them fixing
 

1005
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:04,110
support of basically them fixing
problems that they find is gone so what

1006
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,120
problems that they find is gone so what
 

1007
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,200
problems that they find is gone so what
that means is whenever a hacker finds a

1008
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,210
that means is whenever a hacker finds a
 

1009
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,070
that means is whenever a hacker finds a
way to compromise a Windows 7 machine

1010
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
way to compromise a Windows 7 machine
 

1011
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,960
way to compromise a Windows 7 machine
Microsoft used to fix it and roll it out

1012
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:12,970
Microsoft used to fix it and roll it out
 

1013
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,820
Microsoft used to fix it and roll it out
as an update and and probably break a

1014
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:14,830
as an update and and probably break a
 

1015
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,590
as an update and and probably break a
couple things that along the way but you

1016
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:16,600
couple things that along the way but you
 

1017
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,259
couple things that along the way but you
inevitably fixed the bug that was

1018
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:19,269
inevitably fixed the bug that was
 

1019
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:21,029
inevitably fixed the bug that was
causing hackers to be able to get into

1020
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
causing hackers to be able to get into
 

1021
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,009
causing hackers to be able to get into
your system well now they're not going

1022
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:23,019
your system well now they're not going
 

1023
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:26,310
your system well now they're not going
to do that so as hackers find exploits

1024
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
to do that so as hackers find exploits
 

1025
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
to do that so as hackers find exploits
in Windows 7

1026
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,250
in Windows 7
 

1027
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,310
in Windows 7
Microsoft is just going to say well it's

1028
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
Microsoft is just going to say well it's
 

1029
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,010
Microsoft is just going to say well it's
no longer supported right so we are not

1030
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,020
no longer supported right so we are not
 

1031
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,780
no longer supported right so we are not
going to be patching that and now if

1032
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:34,790
going to be patching that and now if
 

1033
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,130
going to be patching that and now if
you're running Windows 7 you've got this

1034
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,140
you're running Windows 7 you've got this
 

1035
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,370
you're running Windows 7 you've got this
very bad situation and you know maybe

1036
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:39,380
very bad situation and you know maybe
 

1037
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,350
very bad situation and you know maybe
you've got a mix of Windows 7 Linux

1038
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
you've got a mix of Windows 7 Linux
 

1039
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,350
you've got a mix of Windows 7 Linux
Windows 10 and that one Windows 7

1040
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:44,360
Windows 10 and that one Windows 7
 

1041
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,470
Windows 10 and that one Windows 7
machine or god forbid a Windows XP

1042
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:47,480
machine or god forbid a Windows XP
 

1043
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,960
machine or god forbid a Windows XP
machine sadly those still exist

1044
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:49,970
machine sadly those still exist
 

1045
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,680
machine sadly those still exist
they still exist yeah right so if any of

1046
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:53,690
they still exist yeah right so if any of
 

1047
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,540
they still exist yeah right so if any of
those exists that are no longer being

1048
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:55,550
those exists that are no longer being
 

1049
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,530
those exists that are no longer being
patched or supported it can be a really

1050
00:24:59,530 --> 00:24:59,540
patched or supported it can be a really
 

1051
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,200
patched or supported it can be a really
bad situation because that's one it's a

1052
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,210
bad situation because that's one it's a
 

1053
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,780
bad situation because that's one it's a
door it's a doorway like a backdoor into

1054
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:04,790
door it's a doorway like a backdoor into
 

1055
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,040
door it's a doorway like a backdoor into
your computer know your network all of

1056
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,050
your computer know your network all of
 

1057
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,030
your computer know your network all of
all of your devices time so we have to

1058
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,040
all of your devices time so we have to
 

1059
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,820
all of your devices time so we have to
move to Windows 10 but maybe our

1060
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:15,830
move to Windows 10 but maybe our
 

1061
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,580
move to Windows 10 but maybe our
computer can't handle Windows 10 I mean

1062
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:18,590
computer can't handle Windows 10 I mean
 

1063
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,350
computer can't handle Windows 10 I mean
we've got to get more RAM we've got to

1064
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:20,360
we've got to get more RAM we've got to
 

1065
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,750
we've got to get more RAM we've got to
get an SSD in order to be able to run it

1066
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:22,760
get an SSD in order to be able to run it
 

1067
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,820
get an SSD in order to be able to run it
at a reasonably decent speed so that

1068
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:24,830
at a reasonably decent speed so that
 

1069
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,520
at a reasonably decent speed so that
means a a new hard drive and by that

1070
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:27,530
means a a new hard drive and by that
 

1071
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,020
means a a new hard drive and by that
point it's like do you really sync the

1072
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,030
point it's like do you really sync the
 

1073
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,790
point it's like do you really sync the
money into this old thing so you're

1074
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:30,800
money into this old thing so you're
 

1075
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,710
money into this old thing so you're
speaking to my current situation I have

1076
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,720
speaking to my current situation I have
 

1077
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,520
speaking to my current situation I have
an old Windows XP system that I I'm

1078
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:36,530
an old Windows XP system that I I'm
 

1079
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,430
an old Windows XP system that I I'm
setting up for our kids at home yeah so

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,030
that they can use it for school work and
 

1083
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,390
that they can use it for school work and
stuff separate than our family computer

so do we put more RAM into it do we put
a new hard drive into it an SSD and do

personal opinion piece but personally
 

1131
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,700
personal opinion piece but personally
what I have been leaning toward is Linux

1132
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:40,710
what I have been leaning toward is Linux
 

1133
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,499
what I have been leaning toward is Linux
Mint over the past in a while because

1134
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:42,509
Mint over the past in a while because
 

1135
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:46,029
Mint over the past in a while because
the question comes out well what distro

1136
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:46,039
the question comes out well what distro
 

1137
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,649
the question comes out well what distro
okay this is a new word if you're a

okay this is a new word if you're a
 

1139
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,870
okay this is a new word if you're a
Windows user yeah it's short for

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
Windows user yeah it's short for
 

1141
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,860
Windows user yeah it's short for
distribution

1142
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:51,870
distribution
 

1143
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,580
distribution
what distro of Linux or what flavor of

1144
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:55,590
what distro of Linux or what flavor of
 

1145
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,269
what distro of Linux or what flavor of
Linux are you gonna use but because a

1146
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
Linux are you gonna use but because a
 

1147
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,700
Linux are you gonna use but because a
lot of the Linux names are based on

1148
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:01,710
lot of the Linux names are based on
 

1149
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,999
lot of the Linux names are based on
foods that is true that Linux Mint what

1150
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:05,009
foods that is true that Linux Mint what
 

1151
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:07,399
foods that is true that Linux Mint what
flavor mint yeah right

1152
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:07,409
flavor mint yeah right
 

1153
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,680
flavor mint yeah right
what flavor so the computer that I was

1154
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:09,690
what flavor so the computer that I was
 

1155
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,539
what flavor so the computer that I was
talking about I had tried a few

1156
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:11,549
talking about I had tried a few
 

1157
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:14,919
talking about I had tried a few
different distros I had boo bun to Matei

1158
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:14,929
different distros I had boo bun to Matei
 

1159
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:18,680
different distros I had boo bun to Matei
I had also a good option

1160
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:18,690
I had also a good option
 

1161
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,759
I had also a good option
I had Lindos from the inspire inspire

1162
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:22,769
I had Lindos from the inspire inspire
 

1163
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:27,730
I had Lindos from the inspire inspire
yeah inspire no longer yeah that's like

1164
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:27,740
yeah inspire no longer yeah that's like
 

1165
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,639
yeah inspire no longer yeah that's like
fire but I ended up settling on a Linux

1166
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:31,649
fire but I ended up settling on a Linux
 

1167
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,430
fire but I ended up settling on a Linux
Mint yeah yeah and I had was it Sauron

1168
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,440
Mint yeah yeah and I had was it Sauron
 

1169
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,519
Mint yeah yeah and I had was it Sauron
Zorin OS on here yeah before I switch to

1170
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:37,529
Zorin OS on here yeah before I switch to
 

1171
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,700
Zorin OS on here yeah before I switch to
cloud ready yeah yeah okay so Linux

1172
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:40,710
cloud ready yeah yeah okay so Linux
 

1173
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,340
cloud ready yeah yeah okay so Linux
meant for me it's a debian based system

1174
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:43,350
meant for me it's a debian based system
 

1175
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:47,840
meant for me it's a debian based system
so this is the same core that Ubuntu is

1176
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:47,850
so this is the same core that Ubuntu is
 

1177
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,659
so this is the same core that Ubuntu is
based on right so I don't have to and

1178
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:50,669
based on right so I don't have to and
 

1179
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,869
based on right so I don't have to and
I'm a very big Debian fan all my servers

1180
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:53,879
I'm a very big Debian fan all my servers
 

1181
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:57,499
I'm a very big Debian fan all my servers
are like Debian Buster stretched before

1182
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:57,509
are like Debian Buster stretched before
 

1183
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,539
are like Debian Buster stretched before
that and I'm always up to date with the

1184
00:27:59,539 --> 00:27:59,549
that and I'm always up to date with the
 

1185
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,600
that and I'm always up to date with the
latest and debian systems and and and so

1186
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:02,610
latest and debian systems and and and so
 

1187
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,629
latest and debian systems and and and so
and I run stable I don't tend to run

1188
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:05,639
and I run stable I don't tend to run
 

1189
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:07,789
and I run stable I don't tend to run
testing unless it's its feature locked

1190
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:07,799
testing unless it's its feature locked
 

1191
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,850
testing unless it's its feature locked
and ready to go into stable and what

1192
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:10,860
and ready to go into stable and what
 

1193
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
and ready to go into stable and what
that means again if you're new to the

1194
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:12,870
that means again if you're new to the
 

1195
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,149
that means again if you're new to the
Linux world debian is basically there's

1196
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:17,159
Linux world debian is basically there's
 

1197
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,549
Linux world debian is basically there's
a hierarchy so you've got like Debian

1198
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:19,559
a hierarchy so you've got like Debian
 

1199
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,740
a hierarchy so you've got like Debian
you've got Red Hat you've got a couple

1200
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:21,750
you've got Red Hat you've got a couple
 

1201
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,810
you've got Red Hat you've got a couple
other ones as well but those are kind of

1202
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:23,820
other ones as well but those are kind of
 

1203
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,430
other ones as well but those are kind of
the big ones that I think you're going

1204
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
the big ones that I think you're going
 

1205
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,499
the big ones that I think you're going
to encounter we don't need to really

1206
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:27,509
to encounter we don't need to really
 

1207
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,629
to encounter we don't need to really
clutter the landscape but so Debian

1208
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:29,639
clutter the landscape but so Debian
 

1209
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:32,000
clutter the landscape but so Debian
being one that it's going to be based on

1210
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,010
being one that it's going to be based on
 

1211
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,680
being one that it's going to be based on
it could be a boon to it could be Linux

1212
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:33,690
it could be a boon to it could be Linux
 

1213
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,410
it could be a boon to it could be Linux
Mint it could be

1214
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:35,420
Mint it could be
 

1215
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,390
Mint it could be
any number you mentioned a boon to matei

1216
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:37,400
any number you mentioned a boon to matei
 

1217
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,270
any number you mentioned a boon to matei
another one which is essentially Ubuntu

1218
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,280
another one which is essentially Ubuntu
 

1219
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,520
another one which is essentially Ubuntu
with a different interface yes as Mattei

1220
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:42,530
with a different interface yes as Mattei
 

1221
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,280
with a different interface yes as Mattei
is like the menu that the the desktop

1222
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,290
is like the menu that the the desktop
 

1223
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,020
is like the menu that the the desktop
environment so now linux mint is also

1224
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,030
environment so now linux mint is also
 

1225
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,870
environment so now linux mint is also
mattei but it's it's based on a boon to

1226
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
mattei but it's it's based on a boon to
 

1227
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,200
mattei but it's it's based on a boon to
correct all right so it's like this

1228
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,210
correct all right so it's like this
 

1229
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,140
correct all right so it's like this
whole it's like this tree of hierarchy

1230
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,150
whole it's like this tree of hierarchy
 

1231
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,290
whole it's like this tree of hierarchy
of where did this linux come from so

1232
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,300
of where did this linux come from so
 

1233
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,630
of where did this linux come from so
you've got debian is like this fantastic

1234
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
you've got debian is like this fantastic
 

1235
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,180
you've got debian is like this fantastic
server environment but then a boon to

1236
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,190
server environment but then a boon to
 

1237
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,060
server environment but then a boon to
canonical is creating a desktop version

1238
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,070
canonical is creating a desktop version
 

1239
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,160
canonical is creating a desktop version
of that and it's fantastic it's called a

1240
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,170
of that and it's fantastic it's called a
 

1241
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,350
of that and it's fantastic it's called a
boon - and that's where boon tune mattei

1242
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:14,360
boon - and that's where boon tune mattei
 

1243
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,570
boon - and that's where boon tune mattei
comes from and then you've got Linux

1244
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:16,580
comes from and then you've got Linux
 

1245
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,790
comes from and then you've got Linux
Mint which is a fork of that another

1246
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:18,800
Mint which is a fork of that another
 

1247
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,280
Mint which is a fork of that another
word for yeah it's like they've copied

1248
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,290
word for yeah it's like they've copied
 

1249
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,020
word for yeah it's like they've copied
the the codebase and then they've

1250
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,030
the the codebase and then they've
 

1251
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,700
the the codebase and then they've
tweaked it and made it the way that they

1252
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:24,710
tweaked it and made it the way that they
 

1253
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,470
tweaked it and made it the way that they
want it and that's the one that I've

1254
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
want it and that's the one that I've
 

1255
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
want it and that's the one that I've
settled on and it's fantastic so I get

1256
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:28,970
settled on and it's fantastic so I get
 

1257
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,000
settled on and it's fantastic so I get
all the benefits of Debian I get the

1258
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,010
all the benefits of Debian I get the
 

1259
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,250
all the benefits of Debian I get the
benefits of Ubuntu and I get the

1260
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:33,260
benefits of Ubuntu and I get the
 

1261
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,140
benefits of Ubuntu and I get the
benefits of the Linux Mint community as

1262
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,150
benefits of the Linux Mint community as
 

1263
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,350
benefits of the Linux Mint community as
well and so I end up with this extremely

1264
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,360
well and so I end up with this extremely
 

1265
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,470
well and so I end up with this extremely
polished desktop operating system that

1266
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:41,480
polished desktop operating system that
 

1267
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,870
polished desktop operating system that
will run on my old hardware that I don't

1268
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:43,880
will run on my old hardware that I don't
 

1269
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,460
will run on my old hardware that I don't
have to upgrade the RAM that I don't

1270
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:45,470
have to upgrade the RAM that I don't
 

1271
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,700
have to upgrade the RAM that I don't
have to buy a new SSD and it works

1272
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:47,710
have to buy a new SSD and it works
 

1273
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,780
have to buy a new SSD and it works
fantastically in it and it's fairly

1274
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:49,790
fantastically in it and it's fairly
 

1275
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,390
fantastically in it and it's fairly
familiar I don't have to relearn the

1276
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:52,400
familiar I don't have to relearn the
 

1277
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,580
familiar I don't have to relearn the
entire desktop paradigm in order to get

1278
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:54,590
entire desktop paradigm in order to get
 

1279
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,470
entire desktop paradigm in order to get
used to it pretty intuitive like Ike

1280
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
used to it pretty intuitive like Ike
 

1281
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,530
used to it pretty intuitive like Ike
very yeah yeah now you talked about

1282
00:29:59,530 --> 00:29:59,540
very yeah yeah now you talked about
 

1283
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,650
very yeah yeah now you talked about
stable version vs. yes experimental I

1284
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:02,660
stable version vs. yes experimental I
 

1285
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,050
stable version vs. yes experimental I
think this has test yeah so for somebody

1286
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,060
think this has test yeah so for somebody
 

1287
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,570
think this has test yeah so for somebody
who's sit just getting into this and

1288
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:07,580
who's sit just getting into this and
 

1289
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,800
who's sit just getting into this and
they're like oh I download the

1290
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:08,810
they're like oh I download the
 

1291
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,750
they're like oh I download the
experimental what's the pitfall to

1292
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:10,760
experimental what's the pitfall to
 

1293
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,840
experimental what's the pitfall to
experimental versus stable for them

1294
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:12,850
experimental versus stable for them
 

1295
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,900
experimental versus stable for them
testing or CID is what Debian calls it

1296
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:16,910
testing or CID is what Debian calls it
 

1297
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,630
testing or CID is what Debian calls it
so way up at the higher level of the

1298
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:19,640
so way up at the higher level of the
 

1299
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,160
so way up at the higher level of the
hierarchy which you're probably not

1300
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,170
hierarchy which you're probably not
 

1301
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,930
hierarchy which you're probably not
going to touch as a new Linux user okay

1302
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:22,940
going to touch as a new Linux user okay
 

1303
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,330
going to touch as a new Linux user okay
so remember that Debian is like up here

1304
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:25,340
so remember that Debian is like up here
 

1305
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,770
so remember that Debian is like up here
okay so sid is testing version of debian

1306
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:28,780
okay so sid is testing version of debian
 

1307
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,740
okay so sid is testing version of debian
stable is is what they consider stable

1308
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:32,750
stable is is what they consider stable
 

1309
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,480
stable is is what they consider stable
it's been tested okay so it's already

1310
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,490
it's been tested okay so it's already
 

1311
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,220
it's been tested okay so it's already
gone through the testing phase if you

1312
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,230
gone through the testing phase if you
 

1313
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,320
gone through the testing phase if you
were going up here going to testing is

1314
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,330
were going up here going to testing is
 

1315
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,380
were going up here going to testing is
going to end up giving you newer

1316
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:40,390
going to end up giving you newer
 

1317
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,940
going to end up giving you newer
packages so like when the new version of

1318
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:42,950
packages so like when the new version of
 

1319
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,890
packages so like when the new version of
 comes out GNU image manipulation

1320
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:44,900
comes out GNU image manipulation
 

1321
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,050
comes out GNU image manipulation
program you're gonna have the latest and

1322
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,060
program you're gonna have the latest and
 

1323
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,360
program you're gonna have the latest and
greatest right immediately part of

1324
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,370
greatest right immediately part of
 

1325
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,730
greatest right immediately part of
the operating system but it may not be

1326
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:51,740
the operating system but it may not be
 

1327
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,250
the operating system but it may not be
stable it may crash it may have bugs and

1328
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:54,260
stable it may crash it may have bugs and
 

1329
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,810
stable it may crash it may have bugs and
that comes up because it hasn't gone

1330
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:55,820
that comes up because it hasn't gone
 

1331
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,910
that comes up because it hasn't gone
through that testing phase yet once it

1332
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:57,920
through that testing phase yet once it
 

1333
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,000
through that testing phase yet once it
hits stable Ubuntu users would say it's

1334
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,010
hits stable Ubuntu users would say it's
 

1335
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,700
hits stable Ubuntu users would say it's
older version right right

1336
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:03,710
older version right right
 

1337
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,730
older version right right
Debian users will say it's stable yeah

1338
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:06,740
Debian users will say it's stable yeah
 

1339
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,620
Debian users will say it's stable yeah
it doesn't crash it doesn't have any

1340
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:08,630
it doesn't crash it doesn't have any
 

1341
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,540
it doesn't crash it doesn't have any
problems okay so that's a big difference

1342
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:10,550
problems okay so that's a big difference
 

1343
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,210
problems okay so that's a big difference
between a boon to and Debian Debian

1344
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,220
between a boon to and Debian Debian
 

1345
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,780
between a boon to and Debian Debian
stable means it's gone through a lengthy

1346
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:15,790
stable means it's gone through a lengthy
 

1347
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,760
stable means it's gone through a lengthy
maybe two-year testing process like

1348
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:18,770
maybe two-year testing process like
 

1349
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,180
maybe two-year testing process like
proofreaders but are using it ready it

1350
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,190
proofreaders but are using it ready it
 

1351
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,419
proofreaders but are using it ready it
is safe to use its stable okay so it's

1352
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:25,429
is safe to use its stable okay so it's
 

1353
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:26,470
is safe to use its stable okay so it's
rock-solid

1354
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
rock-solid
 

1355
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,910
rock-solid
Lubuntu a little more bleeding-edge

1356
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:27,920
Lubuntu a little more bleeding-edge
 

1357
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,710
Lubuntu a little more bleeding-edge
little more cutting edge and the

1358
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:29,720
little more cutting edge and the
 

1359
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,820
little more cutting edge and the
software versions are going to be a

1360
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:30,830
software versions are going to be a
 

1361
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,310
software versions are going to be a
little bit newer and the package

1362
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,320
little bit newer and the package
 

1363
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
little bit newer and the package
managing and everything else is a little

1364
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,330
managing and everything else is a little
 

1365
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,799
managing and everything else is a little
bit tweaked for end-users but you're not

1366
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:38,809
bit tweaked for end-users but you're not
 

1367
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:41,290
bit tweaked for end-users but you're not
dealing anymore with testing versus

1368
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:41,300
dealing anymore with testing versus
 

1369
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,600
dealing anymore with testing versus
stable it's just here's a boon - yeah

1370
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:43,610
stable it's just here's a boon - yeah
 

1371
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,570
stable it's just here's a boon - yeah
and that's what you get so it's now it

1372
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:46,580
and that's what you get so it's now it
 

1373
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,510
and that's what you get so it's now it
comes down to is it LTS any guesses what

1374
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:49,520
comes down to is it LTS any guesses what
 

1375
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,890
comes down to is it LTS any guesses what
that means or is it not LTS a lifetime

1376
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:53,900
that means or is it not LTS a lifetime
 

1377
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,190
that means or is it not LTS a lifetime
service very close long-term support

1378
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,200
service very close long-term support
 

1379
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,770
service very close long-term support
long-term support oh yes so what that

1380
00:31:59,770 --> 00:31:59,780
long-term support oh yes so what that
 

1381
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,540
long-term support oh yes so what that
means so when you see an Ubuntu release

1382
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:01,550
means so when you see an Ubuntu release
 

1383
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,570
means so when you see an Ubuntu release
that is LTS long-term support which is

1384
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:04,580
that is LTS long-term support which is
 

1385
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,780
that is LTS long-term support which is
currently I is it twelve point oh four

1386
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:07,790
currently I is it twelve point oh four
 

1387
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,020
currently I is it twelve point oh four
is the current LTS its so no it can't be

1388
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,030
is the current LTS its so no it can't be
 

1389
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,110
is the current LTS its so no it can't be
twelve no I don't like 22 I know 1804

1390
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,120
twelve no I don't like 22 I know 1804
 

1391
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,630
twelve no I don't like 22 I know 1804
yes so man I'm in the past day you're in

1392
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:19,640
yes so man I'm in the past day you're in
 

1393
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,770
yes so man I'm in the past day you're in
the past because I've talked about

1394
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:20,780
the past because I've talked about
 

1395
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,430
the past because I've talked about
Windows yeah so LTS means that version

1396
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:24,440
Windows yeah so LTS means that version
 

1397
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,710
Windows yeah so LTS means that version
is going to continue being supported

1398
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
is going to continue being supported
 

1399
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
is going to continue being supported
think of along the terms of what I

1400
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:28,730
think of along the terms of what I
 

1401
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,280
think of along the terms of what I
mentioned about Microsoft it's going to

1402
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,290
mentioned about Microsoft it's going to
 

1403
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,790
mentioned about Microsoft it's going to
continue getting those patches and fixes

1404
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:32,800
continue getting those patches and fixes
 

1405
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,700
continue getting those patches and fixes
for a very long time years okay so if

1406
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:36,710
for a very long time years okay so if
 

1407
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,930
for a very long time years okay so if
you're new and you don't want to have to

1408
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:37,940
you're new and you don't want to have to
 

1409
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,390
you're new and you don't want to have to
reinstall every couple of years or go

1410
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:40,400
reinstall every couple of years or go
 

1411
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,669
reinstall every couple of years or go
through the upgrade process go with LTS

1412
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:42,679
through the upgrade process go with LTS
 

1413
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:45,790
through the upgrade process go with LTS
if you like the brand new versions go

1414
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:45,800
if you like the brand new versions go
 

1415
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,590
if you like the brand new versions go
with the current version which right now

1416
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
with the current version which right now
 

1417
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,160
with the current version which right now
it's 2020 it's not quite April but

1418
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,170
it's 2020 it's not quite April but
 

1419
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,810
it's 2020 it's not quite April but
because it's almost April that means

1420
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:52,820
because it's almost April that means
 

1421
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,660
because it's almost April that means
that 2004 is going to be coming out in

1422
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:58,670
that 2004 is going to be coming out in
 

1423
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,550
that 2004 is going to be coming out in
April because it represents the date

1424
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:00,560
April because it represents the date
 

1425
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,240
April because it represents the date
okay so it's every October and

1426
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,250
okay so it's every October and
 

1427
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,530
okay so it's every October and
celebrates its birthday in April like I

1428
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:05,540
celebrates its birthday in April like I
 

1429
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,170
celebrates its birthday in April like I
do is that what happens ACK yes like

1430
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:08,180
do is that what happens ACK yes like
 

1431
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,560
do is that what happens ACK yes like
that

1432
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:08,570
that
 

1433
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,360
that
so the most recent version then

1434
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,370
so the most recent version then
 

1435
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,450
so the most recent version then
therefore would be 1910 nineteen point

1436
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:13,460
therefore would be 1910 nineteen point
 

1437
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,570
therefore would be 1910 nineteen point
ten so and always for somebody's mind by

1438
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:16,580
ten so and always for somebody's mind by
 

1439
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,930
ten so and always for somebody's mind by
explaining that yeah a little bit yeah

1440
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:22,940
explaining that yeah a little bit yeah
 

1441
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,630
explaining that yeah a little bit yeah
yeah no it's October 2019

1442
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:25,640
yeah no it's October 2019
 

1443
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,630
yeah no it's October 2019
so that version would be the latest

1444
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:27,640
so that version would be the latest
 

1445
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,100
so that version would be the latest
current version of Ubuntu but it's not

1446
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,110
current version of Ubuntu but it's not
 

1447
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,670
current version of Ubuntu but it's not
LTS right so you you'd have to then go

1448
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:33,680
LTS right so you you'd have to then go
 

1449
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,549
LTS right so you you'd have to then go
to 2004 when it's released through the

1450
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:36,559
to 2004 when it's released through the
 

1451
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,590
to 2004 when it's released through the
upgrade path which is pretty easy now

1452
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:38,600
upgrade path which is pretty easy now
 

1453
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,480
upgrade path which is pretty easy now
Linux Mint I believe subscribes to a

1454
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,490
Linux Mint I believe subscribes to a
 

1455
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,120
Linux Mint I believe subscribes to a
very similar model but they base theirs

1456
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,130
very similar model but they base theirs
 

1457
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,910
very similar model but they base theirs
on the LTS of Ubuntu so you're gonna get

1458
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:45,920
on the LTS of Ubuntu so you're gonna get
 

1459
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,450
on the LTS of Ubuntu so you're gonna get
LTS I believe anyway well but they have

1460
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:49,460
LTS I believe anyway well but they have
 

1461
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,150
LTS I believe anyway well but they have
the iterations throughout as well so

1462
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:52,160
the iterations throughout as well so
 

1463
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,060
the iterations throughout as well so
like right now it's Linux Mint 19 and I

1464
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,070
like right now it's Linux Mint 19 and I
 

1465
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,770
like right now it's Linux Mint 19 and I
believe nineteen point two something

1466
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:56,780
believe nineteen point two something
 

1467
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,870
believe nineteen point two something
like that so so it's just it's how it

1468
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:58,880
like that so so it's just it's how it
 

1469
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,400
like that so so it's just it's how it
trickles down so that's what I've

1470
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:00,410
trickles down so that's what I've
 

1471
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,650
trickles down so that's what I've
settled on is Linux Mint because I find

1472
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:02,660
settled on is Linux Mint because I find
 

1473
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,200
settled on is Linux Mint because I find
for my laptop for my desktop it's like

1474
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,210

1477
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,850
the rock solid it's gone it's got

computer we have a dual boot system of

1534
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:22,249
computer we have a dual boot system of
 

1535
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:24,789
computer we have a dual boot system of
Linux Mint and Windows 10 nice and the

1536
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:24,799
Linux Mint and Windows 10 nice and the
 

1537
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:26,769
Linux Mint and Windows 10 nice and the
reason for the dual boot is because of

1538
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:26,779
reason for the dual boot is because of
 

1539
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:28,749
reason for the dual boot is because of
computer games yeah I was gonna guess

1540
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:28,759
computer games yeah I was gonna guess
 

1541
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,489
computer games yeah I was gonna guess
gaming yeah it's gonna be aiming that's

1542
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:30,499
gaming yeah it's gonna be aiming that's
 

1543

1551
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:42,759
roblox oh they're past that now what
else requires Windows what requires

1552
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:42,769
else requires Windows what requires
 

1553
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:48,120
else requires Windows what requires
windows it's also some of our at night

1554
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,130
windows it's also some of our at night

only what else do I have
oh goodness trying to think of some of

1560
00:35:58,839 --> 00:35:58,849
oh goodness trying to think of some of
 

1561
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,160
oh goodness trying to think of some of
the games that are Windows only you

1562
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,170
the games that are Windows only you
 

1563
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,049
the games that are Windows only you
don't game on your laptop I do not this

1564
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:02,059
don't game on your laptop I do not this
 

1565
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,390
don't game on your laptop I do not this
is strictly like the strictly business

1566
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400
is strictly like the strictly business
 

1567
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,660
is strictly like the strictly business
yeah strictly the business I'm

yeah strictly the business I'm
 

1569
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,219
yeah strictly the business I'm
completely blanking on what all's on the

1570
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:09,229
completely blanking on what all's on the
 

1571
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:11,439
completely blanking on what all's on the
computer that's not through Steam okay

1572
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:11,449
computer that's not through Steam okay
 

1573
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:13,839
computer that's not through Steam okay
so gaming on the Windows 10 yeah and you

1574
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:13,849
so gaming on the Windows 10 yeah and you
 

1575
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,489
so gaming on the Windows 10 yeah and you
Jeff has mentioned something that we

1576
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:15,499
Jeff has mentioned something that we
 

1577
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:17,319
Jeff has mentioned something that we
haven't talked about yet tonight the

1578
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:17,329
haven't talked about yet tonight the
 

1579
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:19,539
haven't talked about yet tonight the
dual boot dual booting so what that

1580
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:19,549
dual boot dual booting so what that
 

1581
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:21,729
dual boot dual booting so what that
means is that he's chosen so your

1582
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:21,739
means is that he's chosen so your
 

1583
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,769
means is that he's chosen so your
computer is obviously good enough to run

1584
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:23,779
computer is obviously good enough to run
 

1585
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:26,380
computer is obviously good enough to run
Windows 10 anyways yes okay so that's a

1586
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,390
Windows 10 anyways yes okay so that's a
 

1587
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,109
Windows 10 anyways yes okay so that's a
different scenario in some ways however

1588
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
different scenario in some ways however
 

1589
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,329
different scenario in some ways however
if your computer is able to support it

1590
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:31,339
if your computer is able to support it
 

1591
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:32,439
if your computer is able to support it
and you still want to go the route of

1592
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:32,449
and you still want to go the route of
 

1593
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:34,989
and you still want to go the route of
Linux yeah you can do dual booting can

1594
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:34,999
Linux yeah you can do dual booting can
 

1595
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:36,309
Linux yeah you can do dual booting can
you explain to us what that means yeah

1596
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:36,319
you explain to us what that means yeah
 

1597
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,719
you explain to us what that means yeah
so with dual boot

1598
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:37,729
so with dual boot
 

1599
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,509
so with dual boot
I have partitioned the hard drive that's

1600
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:40,519
I have partitioned the hard drive that's
 

1601
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,089
I have partitioned the hard drive that's
a fancy word Jeff okay so partition

1602
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:43,099
a fancy word Jeff okay so partition
 

1603
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:44,890
a fancy word Jeff okay so partition
means I took the space of the hard drive

1604
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:44,900
means I took the space of the hard drive
 

1605
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,169
means I took the space of the hard drive
yeah and I segmented off into different

1606
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:47,179
yeah and I segmented off into different
 

1607
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,959
yeah and I segmented off into different
portions and so that hard to do

1608
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:49,969
portions and so that hard to do
 

1609
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:52,269
portions and so that hard to do
no it's really that be a straight 50-50

1610
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:52,279
no it's really that be a straight 50-50
 

1611
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:53,919
no it's really that be a straight 50-50
it does not have to be a straight 5050

1612
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:53,929
it does not have to be a straight 5050
 

1613
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,439
it does not have to be a straight 5050
and so my initial boot was not Windows

1614
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:56,449
and so my initial boot was not Windows
 

1615
00:36:56,449 --> 00:37:00,130
and so my initial boot was not Windows
it was Linux so originally it was just

1616
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,140
it was Linux so originally it was just
 

1617
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,640
it was Linux so originally it was just
Linux yeah originally because it was a

1618
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:03,650
Linux yeah originally because it was a
 

1619
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,650
Linux yeah originally because it was a
computer I built okay so it was a blank

1620
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:05,660
computer I built okay so it was a blank
 

1621
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,749
computer I built okay so it was a blank
hard drive and my first install was

1622
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:07,759
hard drive and my first install was
 

1623
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,089
hard drive and my first install was
Linux because when I'm doing the install

1624
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:10,099
Linux because when I'm doing the install
 

1625
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,620
Linux because when I'm doing the install
it says do you intend to do a dual boot

1626
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:11,630
it says do you intend to do a dual boot
 

1627
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,199
it says do you intend to do a dual boot
and so really yep so that was one of the

1628
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:14,209
and so really yep so that was one of the
 

1629
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:15,699
and so really yep so that was one of the
install options and I'm like yes I

1630
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:15,709
install options and I'm like yes I
 

1631
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,529
install options and I'm like yes I
intended to a dual boot and so that's

1632
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:17,539
intended to a dual boot and so that's
 

1633
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,179
intended to a dual boot and so that's
what happened is I setup the dual boot

1634
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:19,189
what happened is I setup the dual boot
 

1635
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:22,929
what happened is I setup the dual boot
I'm blanking on what the dual boot

1636
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:22,939
I'm blanking on what the dual boot
 

1637
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:27,099
I'm blanking on what the dual boot
program is called um gparted no no it's

1638
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:27,109
program is called um gparted no no it's
 

1639
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:29,200
program is called um gparted no no it's
the Installer process yeah

1640
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,210
the Installer process yeah
 

1641
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,230
the Installer process yeah
I'm blanking on what it's called anyway

1642
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,240
I'm blanking on what it's called anyway
 

1643
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,670
I'm blanking on what it's called anyway
so that popped up in the install and

1644
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
so that popped up in the install and
 

1645
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,309
so that popped up in the install and
it's like okay how much do you want to

1646
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:35,319
it's like okay how much do you want to
 

1647
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,260
it's like okay how much do you want to
partition on your hard drive okay your

1648
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,270
partition on your hard drive okay your
 

1649
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,859
partition on your hard drive okay your
Linux operating yankem and so I set up

1650
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:41,869
Linux operating yankem and so I set up
 

1651
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:44,559
Linux operating yankem and so I set up
it was not quite a 50/50 split because I

1652
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:44,569
it was not quite a 50/50 split because I
 

1653
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:46,779
it was not quite a 50/50 split because I
need a ton of space for the games that

1654
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:46,789
need a ton of space for the games that
 

1655
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:50,500
need a ton of space for the games that
get installed so it was more Windows

1656
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,510
get installed so it was more Windows
 

1657
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,720
get installed so it was more Windows
I think it's 25/75 split all in all in

1658
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,730
I think it's 25/75 split all in all in
 

1659
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,059
I think it's 25/75 split all in all in
the hard drive that was the first time I

1660
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:55,069
the hard drive that was the first time I
 

1661
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,500
the hard drive that was the first time I
did the install I've since wiped the

1662
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:56,510
did the install I've since wiped the
 

1663
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,370
did the install I've since wiped the
computer reinstalled it and so that was

1664
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:00,380
computer reinstalled it and so that was
 

1665
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,140
computer reinstalled it and so that was
when I had my spinning hard drive okay

1666
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,150
when I had my spinning hard drive okay
 

1667
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,029
when I had my spinning hard drive okay
and then after I installed Linux I

1668
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:04,039
and then after I installed Linux I
 

1669
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,359
and then after I installed Linux I
booted up again installing windows on

1670
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:07,369
booted up again installing windows on
 

1671
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,819
booted up again installing windows on
the second partition since wiping out

1672
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:09,829
the second partition since wiping out
 

1673
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,720
the second partition since wiping out
that and going with my SSD it's the SSD

1674
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:13,730
that and going with my SSD it's the SSD
 

1675
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,700
that and going with my SSD it's the SSD
I think is 500 gigs and I have two

1676
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:15,710
I think is 500 gigs and I have two
 

1677
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,950
I think is 500 gigs and I have two
terabytes spinning hard drive yeah for

1678
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:17,960
terabytes spinning hard drive yeah for
 

1679
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,019
terabytes spinning hard drive yeah for
it and so that's where my data is on the

1680
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:20,029
it and so that's where my data is on the
 

1681
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:21,370
it and so that's where my data is on the
spinning hard drive yeah and then I'm

1682
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:21,380
spinning hard drive yeah and then I'm
 

1683
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,750
spinning hard drive yeah and then I'm
using the SSD for the operating system

1684
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:22,760
using the SSD for the operating system
 

1685
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,720
using the SSD for the operating system
and that's a 50/50 split okay

1686
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:24,730
and that's a 50/50 split okay
 

1687
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,660
and that's a 50/50 split okay
very complicated sounding but it's by

1688
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:28,670
very complicated sounding but it's by
 

1689
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,140
very complicated sounding but it's by
taut but from the scenario of a user who

1690
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,150
taut but from the scenario of a user who
 

1691
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,430
taut but from the scenario of a user who
say is using Windows and wants to

1692
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,440
say is using Windows and wants to
 

1693
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,410
say is using Windows and wants to
experience Linux and and use Linux

1694
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:38,420
experience Linux and and use Linux
 

1695
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,480
experience Linux and and use Linux
because it's safer because I know I can

1696
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,490
because it's safer because I know I can
 

1697
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,099
because it's safer because I know I can
surf the Internet my kids can use the

1698
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:42,109
surf the Internet my kids can use the
 

1699
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:43,660
surf the Internet my kids can use the

is this is all the stuff that we were

2202
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:35,530
is this is all the stuff that we were
 

2203
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,290
is this is all the stuff that we were
talking about in the 80s like this is

2204
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:37,300
talking about in the 80s like this is
 

2205
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,150
talking about in the 80s like this is
not something you can really patent

2206

not something you can really patent
 

2207
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,700
not something you can really patent
right this is something we've had all

2208
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:41,710
right this is something we've had all
 

2209
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,680
right this is something we've had all
along I'm really happy that they dropped

2210
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:46,690
along I'm really happy that they dropped
 

2211
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,990
along I'm really happy that they dropped
it because to be honest that would have

2212
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:49,000
it because to be honest that would have
 

2213
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,970
it because to be honest that would have
been a relief it wouldn't have been a

2214
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:50,980
been a relief it wouldn't have been a
 

2215
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,920
been a relief it wouldn't have been a
fair fight in that they would have had

2216
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:52,930
fair fight in that they would have had
 

2217
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,260
fair fight in that they would have had
to hire a lawyer outside the state they

2218
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:55,270
to hire a lawyer outside the state they
 

2219
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,440
to hire a lawyer outside the state they
would have associate restful yeah anyone

2220
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:58,450
would have associate restful yeah anyone
 

2221
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,630
would have associate restful yeah anyone
but like what a waste of resource

2222

thing would have been yucky and I really

2228
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:07,150
thing would have been yucky and I really
 

2229

years ago ok and we've been in the
industry for that long and and some of

2478
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:31,710
industry for that long and and some of
 

2479
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:34,160
industry for that long and and some of
us in the IT department not myself of

us in the IT department not myself of
 

2481
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,650
us in the IT department not myself of
course but some of us are on the verge

2482
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:36,660
course but some of us are on the verge
 

2483
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,059
course but some of us are on the verge
of retirement and that's again not a jab

2484
00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:41,069
of retirement and that's again not a jab
 

2485
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:46,150
of retirement and that's again not a jab
I entirely respect what you do however

malware has evolved right significantly
 

2489
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:54,440
malware has evolved right significantly
significantly what we're encountering

00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:54,450
significantly what we're encountering
 

2491
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:57,259
significantly what we're encountering
now is not natus we're not dealing with

2492
00:55:57,259 --> 00:55:57,269
now is not natus we're not dealing with
 

2493
00:55:57,269 --> 00:55:59,630
now is not natus we're not dealing with
BS vs we're not dealing when was the

00:55:59,630 --> 00:55:59,640
BS vs we're not dealing when was the
 

2495
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,700
BS vs we're not dealing when was the
last time you ever saw a BS V and if you

2496
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:01,710
last time you ever saw a BS V and if you
 

2497
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,499
last time you ever saw a BS V and if you
know what a BS V is then you're you're

2498
00:56:03,499 --> 00:56:03,509
know what a BS V is then you're you're
 

2499

this I'm speaking to you it's not about
 

2501
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,539
this I'm speaking to you it's not about
those anymore

2502

those anymore
 

2503
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:11,839
those anymore
no now it's the evolution back in 2017

2504
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:11,849
no now it's the evolution back in 2017
 

2505

no now it's the evolution back in 2017
when wanna cry dropped and we started

2506
00:56:13,819 --> 00:56:13,829
when wanna cry dropped and we started
 

2507
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,490
when wanna cry dropped and we started
seeing ransomware infiltrating networks

2508
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:16,500
seeing ransomware infiltrating networks
 

2509
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,529
seeing ransomware infiltrating networks
and we started seeing RDP attacks and

2510
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:18,539
and we started seeing RDP attacks and
 

2511
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:21,950
and we started seeing RDP attacks and
and eternal blue being exploited and and

2512
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:21,960
and eternal blue being exploited and and
 

2513
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,029
and eternal blue being exploited and and
all of these kinds of things that's when

2514
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:25,039
all of these kinds of things that's when
 

2515
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:27,650
all of these kinds of things that's when
the cybersecurity industry woke up and

2516
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:27,660
the cybersecurity industry woke up and
 

2517
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,910
the cybersecurity industry woke up and
said okay we need to re-educate

2518
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:28,920
said okay we need to re-educate
 

2519
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,490
said okay we need to re-educate
ourselves and if we haven't since then

2520
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:31,500
ourselves and if we haven't since then
 

2521
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,049
ourselves and if we haven't since then
and if we're still thinking in that old

2522
00:56:33,049 --> 00:56:33,059
and if we're still thinking in that old
 

2523
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,920
and if we're still thinking in that old
mindset where viruses is is our threat

2524
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:35,930
mindset where viruses is is our threat
 

2525
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,630
mindset where viruses is is our threat
I'm sorry to say that viruses are not

2526
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
I'm sorry to say that viruses are not
 

2527
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,759
I'm sorry to say that viruses are not
our threat when was the last time we

2528
00:56:40,759 --> 00:56:40,769
our threat when was the last time we
 

2529
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:43,400
our threat when was the last time we
ever heard of a virus infiltration it

2530
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,410
ever heard of a virus infiltration it
 

2531
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,079
ever heard of a virus infiltration it
truly has been a long time although

2532
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:45,089
truly has been a long time although
 

2533
00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:47,509
truly has been a long time although
still go I don't want viruses it's like

2534
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:47,519
still go I don't want viruses it's like
 

2535
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:48,950
still go I don't want viruses it's like

antivirus I'm safe yeah when was the

2538
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:51,779
antivirus I'm safe yeah when was the
 

2539
00:56:51,779 --> 00:56:54,950
antivirus I'm safe yeah when was the
last time you heard of a virus I haven't

last time you heard of a virus I haven't
 

2541
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,509
last time you heard of a virus I haven't
got a virus infection because I have

2542
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:56,519
got a virus infection because I have
 

2543
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,549
got a virus infection because I have
antivirus no I'm just saying that's

2544
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
antivirus no I'm just saying that's
 

2545

that's not an old-school way of thinking

2546
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:01,049
that's not an old-school way of thinking
 

2547
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:02,480
that's not an old-school way of thinking
and it's a dangerous way of thinking

2548
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:02,490
and it's a dangerous way of thinking
 

2549
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:06,230
and it's a dangerous way of thinking
because that's that's how these big

2550
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
because that's that's how these big
 

2551
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,599
because that's that's how these big
industries are getting hit because we've

2552
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:08,609
industries are getting hit because we've
 

2553
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:10,339
industries are getting hit because we've
got that old-school thinking and we're

got that old-school thinking and we're
 

2555
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:12,650
got that old-school thinking and we're
not adequately educating and protecting

not adequately educating and protecting
 

2557

yes not yesterday is not 1999 threats

2572
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:31,019
yes not yesterday is not 1999 threats
 

2573
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:33,319
yes not yesterday is not 1999 threats
now I know we have to get to the next

2574
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:33,329
now I know we have to get to the next
 

2575
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:36,529
now I know we have to get to the next
story but is part of this a budgetary

2576
00:57:36,529 --> 00:57:36,539
story but is part of this a budgetary
 

2577
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:38,539
story but is part of this a budgetary
compulsion sure like they're looking at

00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:38,549
compulsion sure like they're looking at
 

2579
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:40,039
compulsion sure like they're looking at
it go ahead we can only put in one

2580
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:40,049
it go ahead we can only put in one
 

2581
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:41,630
it go ahead we can only put in one
percent total budget for cybersecurity

percent total budget for cybersecurity
 

2583
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,759
percent total budget for cybersecurity
when really they should be looking at 10

2584
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:43,769
when really they should be looking at 10
 

2585
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:45,829
when really they should be looking at 10
percent look at not that there's a

2586
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
percent look at not that there's a
 

2587
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,079
percent look at not that there's a
defined number but like the way the

2588
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:48,089
defined number but like the way the
 

2589
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,730
defined number but like the way the
things grow it's like you have to grow

2590
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:49,740
things grow it's like you have to grow
 

2591
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,650
things grow it's like you have to grow
with the threats and if that means

2592
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:51,660
with the threats and if that means
 

2593
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,569
with the threats and if that means
allocating more of your budget to more

2594

00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,269
you're doing you gotta just the budget
accordingly you can't just stick another

accordingly you can't just stick another
 

2603
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:06,559
accordingly you can't just stick another
same number be like well we've got our

we've got an old computer we got to
 

2609
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:11,299
we've got an old computer we got to
replace so that's our budget it's like

2610
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:11,309
replace so that's our budget it's like
 

2611

replace so that's our budget it's like
yes I think it's exactly the same

01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:08,380
potentially right yes yeah so and but I
mean something like that I think could

2786
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:08,390
mean something like that I think could
 

2787
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,660
mean something like that I think could
have more of a positive impact than

2788
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:10,670
have more of a positive impact than
 

2789
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,980
have more of a positive impact than
saying I'm just going to throw money out

2790
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:11,990
saying I'm just going to throw money out
 

2791
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,800
saying I'm just going to throw money out
there however you're thinking in terms

2792
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:14,810
there however you're thinking in terms
 

2793
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:16,120
there however you're thinking in terms
of his business yes

2794
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:16,130
of his business yes
 

2795
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,430
of his business yes

2796
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:18,440
so you're thinking Amazon can make
 

2797
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,109
so you're thinking Amazon can make
changes and maybe they will we'll see

2798
01:02:20,109 --> 01:02:20,119
changes and maybe they will we'll see
 

2799
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:22,900
changes and maybe they will we'll see
it's his company but what he's doing

2800
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:22,910
it's his company but what he's doing
 

2801
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,150
it's his company but what he's doing
here is instead setting up a venture

2802
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:25,160
here is instead setting up a venture
 

2803
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,920
here is instead setting up a venture
fund that says this is for environmental

2804
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:29,930
fund that says this is for environmental
 

2805
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:32,800
fund that says this is for environmental
science environmental research and

01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:32,810
science environmental research and
 

2807
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,010
science environmental research and
whatever whatever can come from that so

2808
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:36,020
whatever whatever can come from that so
 

2809
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,740
whatever whatever can come from that so
this is not Amazon correct this is an

2810
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:38,750
this is not Amazon correct this is an
 

2811
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,890
this is not Amazon correct this is an
investment of 8% of his fortune that he

2812
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:41,900
investment of 8% of his fortune that he
 

2813
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:46,030
investment of 8% of his fortune that he
will go yes that will go toward those

2814
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:46,040
will go yes that will go toward those
 

2815
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,430
will go yes that will go toward those
that research and things that could

2816
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:48,440
that research and things that could
 

2817
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,890
that research and things that could
potentially make a very large impact on

2818
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:50,900
potentially make a very large impact on
 

2819
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,700
potentially make a very large impact on
a positive shift in an environmental

2820
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:54,710
a positive shift in an environmental
 

2821
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,849
a positive shift in an environmental
impact I also wonder if part of it is a

2822
01:02:56,849 --> 01:02:56,859
impact I also wonder if part of it is a
 

2823
01:02:56,859 --> 01:03:01,019
impact I also wonder if part of it is a
as a taxation

2824
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:01,029

 

2825
01:03:01,029 --> 01:03:03,460

that's okay here's the thing even if it

2826
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:03,470
that's okay here's the thing even if it
 

2827
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,950
that's okay here's the thing even if it
just changes the focus for people going

2828
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:05,960
just changes the focus for people going
 

2829
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,980
just changes the focus for people going

2831
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:13,440
oh wait climate change is that important
it is asking that question now but

2832
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:13,450
it is asking that question now but
 

2833
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:16,269
it is asking that question now but
saying like if he if he's saying yes

2834
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:16,279
saying like if he if he's saying yes

3073
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,709
30 days on potentially a shared device I
mean I would hope that you're not using

3074
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:26,719
mean I would hope that you're not using
 

3075
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,150
mean I would hope that you're not using
on a shared device but I think for a lot

3076
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:28,160
on a shared device but I think for a lot
 

3077
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,120
on a shared device but I think for a lot
of people on a home computer or maybe

3078
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:31,130
of people on a home computer or maybe
 

3079
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,910
of people on a home computer or maybe
like a laptop or something I'm assuming

3080
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:33,920
like a laptop or something I'm assuming
 

3081
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,959
like a laptop or something I'm assuming
this is also gonna be the same case with

3085
01:08:37,219 --> 01:08:41,740
phones if you're viewing on your phone
like I think that that likely 30 days is

3086
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:41,750
like I think that that likely 30 days is
 

3087
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,260
like I think that that likely 30 days is
the mandatory you can probably set it to

3088
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:44,270
the mandatory you can probably set it to
 

3089
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:46,209
the mandatory you can probably set it to
be more frequent I would hold on I mean

3090
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:46,219
be more frequent I would hold on I mean
 

3091
01:08:46,219 --> 01:08:47,709
be more frequent I would hold on I mean
I have a lot of two-factor

3092
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:47,719
I have a lot of two-factor
 

3093
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:49,660
I have a lot of two-factor
authentication devices and most of them

3094
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:49,670
authentication devices and most of them
 

3095
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,539
authentication devices and most of them
I just set to every time I think also

3096
01:08:52,539 --> 01:08:52,549
I just set to every time I think also
 

3097
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:55,680
I just set to every time I think also
though you're putting a local spin on

3098
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:55,690
though you're putting a local spin on
 

3099
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:58,990
though you're putting a local spin on
the security right you're thinking along

3100
01:08:58,990 --> 01:08:59,000
the security right you're thinking along
 

3101
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,760
the security right you're thinking along
the terms of somebody breaking into your

3102
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:00,770
the terms of somebody breaking into your
 

3103
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,260
the terms of somebody breaking into your
house and having access to your security

3104
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:02,270
house and having access to your security
 

3105
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,660
house and having access to your security
cameras but if they have that then

3106
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:04,670
cameras but if they have that then
 

3107
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:08,440
cameras but if they have that then
they're already em I get that but I I

3108
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,450
they're already em I get that but I I
 

3109
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,390
they're already em I get that but I I
don't know I just to me 30 days seems

3110
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,400
don't know I just to me 30 days seems
 

3111
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,880
don't know I just to me 30 days seems
long like it's two weeks I'd be okay

3112
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:12,890
long like it's two weeks I'd be okay
 

3113
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,130
long like it's two weeks I'd be okay
with two weeks two weeks make sense but

3114
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:15,140
with two weeks two weeks make sense but
 

3115
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,039
with two weeks two weeks make sense but
30 days to me seems long what do you

3116
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:18,049
30 days to me seems long what do you
 

3117
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:21,039
30 days to me seems long what do you
think should it be 45 days go there I

3118
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:21,049
think should it be 45 days go there I
 

3119
01:09:21,049 --> 01:09:24,820
think should it be 45 days go there I
think that the idea here is not so much

3120
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:24,830
think that the idea here is not so much
 

3121
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,530
think that the idea here is not so much
the spin that you're giving it but

3122
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:26,540
the spin that you're giving it but
 

3123
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:30,039
the spin that you're giving it but
instead it's to prevent illicit access

3124
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:30,049
instead it's to prevent illicit access
 

3125
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:32,229
instead it's to prevent illicit access
from outside I don't I don't want

3126
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
from outside I don't I don't want
 

3127
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,720
from outside I don't I don't want
somebody from Latvia being able to

somebody from Latvia being able to
 

3129
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:37,120
somebody from Latvia being able to
access my security key of course I don't

3130
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:37,130
access my security key of course I don't
 

3131
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,890
access my security key of course I don't
want that against Latvia by the way

3132
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:38,900
want that against Latvia by the way
 

3133
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,899
want that against Latvia by the way
nothing against Latvia there very

3134
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:40,909
nothing against Latvia there very
 

3135
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:42,849

peaceful people I don't want somebody
and you can have access to my cameras

3138
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:45,850
and you can have access to my cameras
 

3139
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,439
and you can have access to my cameras
I'll give you my two FA code right now

3140
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,449
I'll give you my two FA code right now
 

3141
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:52,570
I'll give you my two FA code right now
but my point is that I think that's what

3142
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:52,580
but my point is that I think that's what
 

3143
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,249
but my point is that I think that's what
I'm trying to lock yes I'm trying to

3144
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:54,259
I'm trying to lock yes I'm trying to
 

3145

I'm trying to lock yes I'm trying to
lock down yeah people that are trying to

3146
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:57,170
lock down yeah people that are trying to
 

3147
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:00,430
lock down yeah people that are trying to
hack into my security cameras

3148
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:00,440
hack into my security cameras
 

3149
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,500
hack into my security cameras
I want that two-factor authentication to

3150
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:02,510
I want that two-factor authentication to
 

3151
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,540
I want that two-factor authentication to
block that attempt because even if they

3152
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:04,550
block that attempt because even if they
 

3153
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,700
block that attempt because even if they
get in they can't get further than the

3154
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:06,710
get in they can't get further than the
 

3155
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,439
get in they can't get further than the
two FA because they don't have my device

3156
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:08,449
two FA because they don't have my device
 

3157
01:10:08,449 --> 01:10:10,870
two FA because they don't have my device
to get that code right but it's not just

3158
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:10,880
to get that code right but it's not just
 

3159
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,209
to get that code right but it's not just
text it was also email you know if

3160
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:13,219
text it was also email you know if
 

3161
01:10:13,219 --> 01:10:14,530
text it was also email you know if
they've gotten into you once it's a

3162
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:14,540
they've gotten into you once it's a
 

3163
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,790
they've gotten into you once it's a
one-time-use password

3164
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:15,800
one-time-use password
 

3165
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,860
one-time-use password
so once I've logged in on my computer

3166
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:17,870
so once I've logged in on my computer
 

3167
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:20,110
so once I've logged in on my computer
with that two FA code they can't use

3168
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:20,120
with that two FA code they can't use
 

3169
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,300
with that two FA code they can't use
that same code again that's about an

3170
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:22,310
that same code again that's about an
 

3171
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,910
that same code again that's about an
area of access to your I mean like this

3172
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:24,920
area of access to your I mean like this
 

3173
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,700
area of access to your I mean like this
is why I'm saying thirty days is not

3174
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:26,710
is why I'm saying thirty days is not
 

3175
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,740
is why I'm saying thirty days is not
great you know what is great though that

3176
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:29,750
great you know what is great though that
 

3177
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:34,090
great you know what is great though that
it's happening at all it's compulsory by

3178
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:34,100
it's happening at all it's compulsory by
 

3179
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,580
it's happening at all it's compulsory by
default which is that's the advantage

3180
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:36,590
default which is that's the advantage
 

3181
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:38,439
default which is that's the advantage
here right we don't all think about

3182
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:38,449
here right we don't all think about
 

3183
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:40,660
here right we don't all think about
especially novice users who go to a

3184
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:40,670
especially novice users who go to a
 

3185
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,180
especially novice users who go to a
super center and buy one of these smart

3186
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:43,190
super center and buy one of these smart
 

3187
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:46,120
super center and buy one of these smart
cameras and don't know that hey I really

3188
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:46,130
cameras and don't know that hey I really
 

3189
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,490
cameras and don't know that hey I really
need to enable two FA mm-hmm you know

3190
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:48,500
need to enable two FA mm-hmm you know
 

3191
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,470
need to enable two FA mm-hmm you know
what some people are right turned off by

3192
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:50,480
what some people are right turned off by
 

3193
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,720
what some people are right turned off by
two FA which blows my mind when I have

3194
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:52,730
two FA which blows my mind when I have
 

3195
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:54,580
two FA which blows my mind when I have
technical session right when I have

3196
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:54,590
technical session right when I have
 

3197
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,860
technical session right when I have
people over to my house and I'm you know

people over to my house and I'm you know
showing them my VR and I have my Steam

3200
01:10:59,919 --> 01:10:59,929
showing them my VR and I have my Steam
 

3201
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:03,100
showing them my VR and I have my Steam
account it's 2 FA and they're like why

3202
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:03,110
account it's 2 FA and they're like why
 

3203
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,660
account it's 2 FA and they're like why
do you have it so that it texts your

3204
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:04,670
do you have it so that it texts your
 

3205
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,990
do you have it so that it texts your
phone next time you go to like hey

3206
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:08,000
phone next time you go to like hey
 

3207
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,390
phone next time you go to like hey
what's the 2 FA for your Wi-Fi and then

3208
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:13,400
what's the 2 FA for your Wi-Fi and then
 

3209
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,090
what's the 2 FA for your Wi-Fi and then
I have to like explain it to them but

3210
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:16,100
I have to like explain it to them but
 

3211
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,640
I have to like explain it to them but
they're like oh it's like my banking is

two-factor authentication like all like

3214
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
two-factor authentication like all like
 

3215
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,770
two-factor authentication like all like
I like it to me it feels good yeah I

3216
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:23,780
I like it to me it feels good yeah I
 

3217
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,770
I like it to me it feels good yeah I
think I think 2 FA should be the default

3218
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:26,780
think I think 2 FA should be the default
 

3219
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,320
think I think 2 FA should be the default
for all security for everything yeah

3220
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:29,330
for all security for everything yeah
 

3221
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:32,590
for all security for everything yeah
yeah yeah it just makes sense in it and

3222
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:32,600
yeah yeah it just makes sense in it and
 

3223
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,160
yeah yeah it just makes sense in it and
it let's be clear and Jeff it is not

01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:36,170
it let's be clear and Jeff it is not
