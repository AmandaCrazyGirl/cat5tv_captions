00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,430
can do more than what Windows allows me
 

163
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,690
can do more than what Windows allows me
to do what Linux allows me to do what

164
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:38,700
to do what Linux allows me to do what
 

165
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,090
to do what Linux allows me to do what
when was that point for you probably

166
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,100
when was that point for you probably
 

167
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,670
when was that point for you probably
around 10 or 11 I'd say when I started

168
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
around 10 or 11 I'd say when I started
 

169
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,230
around 10 or 11 I'd say when I started
when a lot of people on the internet

170
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
when a lot of people on the internet
 

171
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,140
when a lot of people on the internet
started coming out and trying to the

172
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,150
started coming out and trying to the
 

173
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,730
started coming out and trying to the
public like what you can do with this

174
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:52,740
public like what you can do with this
 

175
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,100
public like what you can do with this
and how everything can be explained I

176
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,110
and how everything can be explained I
 

177
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,930
and how everything can be explained I
thought I wanted to learn that ability

178
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:01,940
thought I wanted to learn that ability
 

179
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,900
thought I wanted to learn that ability
more so for good about okay so you know

180
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:08,910
more so for good about okay so you know
 

181
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,580
more so for good about okay so you know
and these devices you mentioned printers

182
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:10,590
and these devices you mentioned printers
 

183
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,960
and these devices you mentioned printers
and we're gonna talk more about that but

184
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:11,970
and we're gonna talk more about that but
 

185
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,770
and we're gonna talk more about that but
these devices are benign considered safe

186
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:15,780
these devices are benign considered safe
 

187
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,170
these devices are benign considered safe
these are these are devices that people

188
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,180
these are these are devices that people
 

189
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,930
these are these are devices that people
trust to plug into their network I mean

190
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:20,940
trust to plug into their network I mean
 

191
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,820
trust to plug into their network I mean
you walk into any Super Center you buy a

192
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:22,830
you walk into any Super Center you buy a
 

193
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,260
you walk into any Super Center you buy a
printer and you install it and it just

194
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,270
printer and you install it and it just
 

195
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,330
printer and you install it and it just
works yeah what is it that drew you to

196
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:28,340
works yeah what is it that drew you to
 

197
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:38,690
works yeah what is it that drew you to
start attacking those devices a little

198
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:38,700
start attacking those devices a little
 

199
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,600
start attacking those devices a little
bit easier of an axis then a more

200
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:41,610
bit easier of an axis then a more
 

201
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,960
bit easier of an axis then a more
sophisticated system so it was easy

202
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:44,970
sophisticated system so it was easy
 

203
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,530
sophisticated system so it was easy
enough for each of you but just don't

204
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:48,540
enough for each of you but just don't
 

205
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,440
enough for each of you but just don't
have a challenge and a large amount to

206
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,450
have a challenge and a large amount to
 

207
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,090
have a challenge and a large amount to
bomb like a surplus of pictures on any

208
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,100
bomb like a surplus of pictures on any
 

209
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,940
bomb like a surplus of pictures on any
given network so you know you're I have

210
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:01,950
given network so you know you're I have
 

211
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,470
given network so you know you're I have
a lot of access to them and it made it a

212
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:06,480
a lot of access to them and it made it a
 

213
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
a lot of access to them and it made it a
little bit easier sorry I'm kind of

214
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,490
little bit easier sorry I'm kind of
 

215
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,330
little bit easier sorry I'm kind of
contractor no not at all not at all so

216
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,340
contractor no not at all not at all so
 

217
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,940
contractor no not at all not at all so
but it makes me think though and we're

218
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:13,950
but it makes me think though and we're
 

219
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,820
but it makes me think though and we're
speaking with the Canadian hacker here

220
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:15,830
speaking with the Canadian hacker here
 

221
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,950
speaking with the Canadian hacker here
the Canadian hacker we know you by no

222
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
the Canadian hacker we know you by no
 

223
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,920
the Canadian hacker we know you by no
other name when you're attacking

224
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:21,930
other name when you're attacking
 

225
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,679
other name when you're attacking
printers so so I

226
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:24,689
printers so so I
 

227
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:28,070
printers so so I
as a consoled me as a consumer our

228
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
as a consoled me as a consumer our
 

229
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,189
as a consoled me as a consumer our
viewers as consumers will purchase a

230
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
viewers as consumers will purchase a
 

231
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,779
viewers as consumers will purchase a
printer and just install it on their

232
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:32,789
printer and just install it on their
 

233
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,829
printer and just install it on their
network so what makes that device a

234
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:35,839
network so what makes that device a
 

235
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,209
network so what makes that device a
vulnerable device you just think it's a

236
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:38,219
vulnerable device you just think it's a
 

237
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,039
vulnerable device you just think it's a
benign device just sitting on your

238
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:40,049
benign device just sitting on your
 

239
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:44,689
benign device just sitting on your
network that you print - well how are we

240
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:44,699
network that you print - well how are we
 

241
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,879
network that you print - well how are we
able to attack that how what is what is

242
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:46,889
able to attack that how what is what is
 

243
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,549
able to attack that how what is what is
it that I should know as a consumer that

244
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:49,559
it that I should know as a consumer that
 

245
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:52,999
it that I should know as a consumer that
you can share with me as a hacker that I

246
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,009
you can share with me as a hacker that I
 

247
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,499
you can share with me as a hacker that I
should know about that printer being

248
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:54,509
should know about that printer being
 

249
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,540
should know about that printer being
connected to my network is how like

250
00:06:59,540 --> 00:06:59,550
connected to my network is how like
 

251
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,719
connected to my network is how like
security fever I guess you can say um

252
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:01,729
security fever I guess you can say um
 

253
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:04,850
security fever I guess you can say um
you might think that they're safe when

254
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:04,860
you might think that they're safe when
 

255
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,829
you might think that they're safe when
they really truly not and for printers

256
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:06,839
they really truly not and for printers
 

257
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,799
they really truly not and for printers
in this case um there's a lot of it's on

258
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:09,809
in this case um there's a lot of it's on
 

259
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:12,290
in this case um there's a lot of it's on
your network that it can be accessed

260
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,300
your network that it can be accessed
 

261
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,749
your network that it can be accessed
with which I don't mean that you don't

262
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:14,759
with which I don't mean that you don't
 

263
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,669
with which I don't mean that you don't
you shouldn't connected to your network

264
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:16,679
you shouldn't connected to your network
 

265
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,219
you shouldn't connected to your network
I mean it makes it so much easier to

266
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:19,229
I mean it makes it so much easier to
 

267
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,079
I mean it makes it so much easier to
think anything else that you just have

268
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,089
think anything else that you just have
 

269
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,079
think anything else that you just have
to be really careful with what's exposed

270
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,089
to be really careful with what's exposed
 

271
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,259
to be really careful with what's exposed
because there's outputs ninety one

272
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:27,269
because there's outputs ninety one
 

273
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:29,449
because there's outputs ninety one
hundred five one five and six three one

274
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:29,459
hundred five one five and six three one
 

275
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,899
hundred five one five and six three one
which is the main three ports that then

276
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:32,909
which is the main three ports that then
 

277
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,389
which is the main three ports that then
it's mainly ninety one hundred six three

278
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:35,399
it's mainly ninety one hundred six three
 

279
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:41,059
it's mainly ninety one hundred six three
one isn't that cups yeah so you gotta be

280
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:41,069
one isn't that cups yeah so you gotta be
 

281
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,999
one isn't that cups yeah so you gotta be
really careful with them what you're

282
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:44,009
really careful with them what you're
 

283
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,540
really careful with them what you're
exposing um and you just always not be

284
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:47,550
exposing um and you just always not be
 

285
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,669
exposing um and you just always not be
watching out with what you're installing

286
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:49,679
watching out with what you're installing
 

287
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,109
watching out with what you're installing
to hear about what you're adding to

288
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:51,119
to hear about what you're adding to
 

289
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,290
to hear about what you're adding to
network because I guess I could get into

290
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,300
network because I guess I could get into
 

291
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,350
network because I guess I could get into
that picture and if I wanted you

292
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
that picture and if I wanted you
 

293
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,199
that picture and if I wanted you
attacked it for malicious reasons but

294
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,209
attacked it for malicious reasons but
 

295
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,779
attacked it for malicious reasons but
here a large business I could anything

296
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:02,789
here a large business I could anything
 

297
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:04,279
here a large business I could anything
you print off finance reports or

298
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:04,289
you print off finance reports or
 

299
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,699
you print off finance reports or
anything I would actually be able to use

300
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:07,709
anything I would actually be able to use
 

301
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,609
anything I would actually be able to use
a man-in-the-middle attack and she drops

302
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:10,619
a man-in-the-middle attack and she drops
 

303
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:14,589
a man-in-the-middle attack and she drops
so Lauren yeah she really have to be

304
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:14,599
so Lauren yeah she really have to be
 

305
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,999
so Lauren yeah she really have to be
careful with what you're putting or

306
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:17,009
careful with what you're putting or
 

307
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,189
careful with what you're putting or
connecting to your network and you

308
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
connecting to your network and you
 

309
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,839
connecting to your network and you
should always be checking on your

310
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:20,849
should always be checking on your
 

311
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:25,429
should always be checking on your
settings on your modem or I mean people

00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:25,439
settings on your modem or I mean people
 

313
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,929

00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:26,939
know this router but it's really all the
 

315
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,859
know this router but it's really all the
rage on to see what ports your long to

316
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:30,869
rage on to see what ports your long to
 

317
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,379
rage on to see what ports your long to

Canadian hacker you're dropping a bunch

322
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:36,630
Canadian hacker you're dropping a bunch

325
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,529
of bombs here so I got to cut you off
because like okay we got to talk about

326
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:39,539
because like okay we got to talk about
 

327
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,870
because like okay we got to talk about
this UPnP is enabled on a lot of

this UPnP is enabled on a lot of
 

329
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,990
this UPnP is enabled on a lot of
router's you UPnP means as soon as you

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,000
router's you UPnP means as soon as you
 

331
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,240
router's you UPnP means as soon as you
plug that printer in it opens up the

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,250
plug that printer in it opens up the
 

333
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,520
plug that printer in it opens up the

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:49,530
ports it doesn't matter if you
 

335
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,950
ports it doesn't matter if you
specifically said open up those ports no

336
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:51,960
specifically said open up those ports no
 

337
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,320
specifically said open up those ports no
UPnP will automatically do that because

338
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,330
UPnP will automatically do that because
 

339
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,530
UPnP will automatically do that because
it detects the new printer and allows it

340
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,540
it detects the new printer and allows it
 

341
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,410
it detects the new printer and allows it
to open those ports automatically that's

342
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,420
to open those ports automatically that's
 

343
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,000
to open those ports automatically that's
dangerous that's what I'm learning here

344
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,010
dangerous that's what I'm learning here
 

345
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,250
dangerous that's what I'm learning here
but you're talking about okay not only

346
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,260
but you're talking about okay not only
 

347
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,480
but you're talking about okay not only
are you able to send print jobs to my

348
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,490
are you able to send print jobs to my
 

349
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,170
are you able to send print jobs to my
printer but you're able to intercept the

350
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,180
printer but you're able to intercept the
 

351
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,970

print jobs that I send to my printer
 

353
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,700
print jobs that I send to my printer
exactly yeah and you can see how injures

354
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,710
exactly yeah and you can see how injures
 

355
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,440
exactly yeah and you can see how injures
that is and a lot of the security

356
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,450
that is and a lot of the security
 

357
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,260
that is and a lot of the security
features on printers that say like only

358
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,270
features on printers that say like only
 

359
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,240
features on printers that say like only
our men will be saved on the system or

361
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,830
our men will be saved on the system or
anything like that um because it's not

362
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:33,840
anything like that um because it's not
 

363
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,380
anything like that um because it's not
it's again a form of security feeder

364
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,390
it's again a form of security feeder
 

365
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,140
it's again a form of security feeder
you're really thinking it's more safe

366
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,150
you're really thinking it's more safe
 

367
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,190
you're really thinking it's more safe
than it truly is I can't help but think

368
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
than it truly is I can't help but think
 

369
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,070
than it truly is I can't help but think

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:41,650
so and so many people don't understand
 

477
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,250
so and so many people don't understand
that this is such a huge issue and be

478
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,260
that this is such a huge issue and be
 

479
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,020
that this is such a huge issue and be
like I haven't contacted I'm on edge

480
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,030
like I haven't contacted I'm on edge
 

481
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,010
like I haven't contacted I'm on edge
um I probably should most like

482
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,020
um I probably should most like
 

483
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,860
um I probably should most like
in the future but you really have to be

484
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:54,870
in the future but you really have to be
 

485
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,960
in the future but you really have to be
careful with what you're installing onto

486
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:56,970
careful with what you're installing onto
 

487
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,750
careful with what you're installing onto
your network because especially with

488
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
your network because especially with
 

489
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,440
your network because especially with
that like that did send a bit of a shock

490
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,450
that like that did send a bit of a shock
 

491
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,750
that like that did send a bit of a shock
because looked at anybody could walk

492
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
because looked at anybody could walk
 

493
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,870
because looked at anybody could walk
into my mode on oh we need to do more

494
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
into my mode on oh we need to do more
 

495
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,180
into my mode on oh we need to do more
basic things like we said it or power it

496
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,190
basic things like we said it or power it
 

497
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,430
basic things like we said it or power it
off but then it also gives you more

498
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
off but then it also gives you more
 

499
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,860
off but then it also gives you more
access to your network then you should

500
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:15,870
access to your network then you should
 

501
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,079
access to your network then you should
ever have like a modem or a router would

502
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:21,089
ever have like a modem or a router would
 

503
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,519
ever have like a modem or a router would
allow me to open up say port 3389 the

504
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:25,529
allow me to open up say port 3389 the
 

505
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:28,130
allow me to open up say port 3389 the
network which would allow me as a hacker

506
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,140
network which would allow me as a hacker
 

507
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,940
network which would allow me as a hacker
to remotely access your computer desktop

508
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:31,950
to remotely access your computer desktop
 

509
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,440
to remotely access your computer desktop
and wreak all kinds of havoc what other

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:41,670
does this introduce to our network I
 

515
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,820
does this introduce to our network I

don't ever think twice about the

524
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:50,640
don't ever think twice about the
 

525
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,970
don't ever think twice about the
security of that device what what does

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:00,300
you're taking the high road and saying
 

533
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,460
you're taking the high road and saying
you know I'm gonna educate people but

534
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:04,470
you know I'm gonna educate people but
 

535
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,069
you know I'm gonna educate people but
what about those hackers that are saying

536
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:07,079
what about those hackers that are saying
 

537
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:14,360
what about those hackers that are saying
no I'm gonna exploit people that's a

538
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,370
no I'm gonna exploit people that's a
 

539
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,010
no I'm gonna exploit people that's a
very good question I'm just gonna

540
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,020
very good question I'm just gonna
 

541
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,380
very good question I'm just gonna
pretending of their own

542
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,390
pretending of their own
 

543
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,319
pretending of their own
it is truly astonishing what you can do

544
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:21,329
it is truly astonishing what you can do
 

545
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,160
it is truly astonishing what you can do
when you have access to these systems

546
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,170
when you have access to these systems
 

547
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,380
when you have access to these systems
what you said I mean I believe those are

548
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,390
what you said I mean I believe those are
 

549
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,920
what you said I mean I believe those are
you people correct yeah yeah so um

550
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:30,930
you people correct yeah yeah so um
 

551
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,319
you people correct yeah yeah so um
figure out without one you most likely

552
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:33,329
figure out without one you most likely
 

553
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:35,269
figure out without one you most likely
chap you need to have that one enabled

554
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
chap you need to have that one enabled
 

555
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,600
chap you need to have that one enabled
but there's so many exploits with this

556
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:38,610
but there's so many exploits with this
 

557
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,220
but there's so many exploits with this
and a modem you know you'll be able just

558
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,230
and a modem you know you'll be able just
 

559
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,470
and a modem you know you'll be able just
in most cases you can see what is

560
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,480
in most cases you can see what is
 

561
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,590
in most cases you can see what is
installed on the network uh and then

562
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:48,600
installed on the network uh and then
 

563
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,100
installed on the network uh and then
your shoulder specific IP address and

564
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,110
your shoulder specific IP address and
 

565
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,319
your shoulder specific IP address and
you can find vulnerabilities and like

566
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:54,329
you can find vulnerabilities and like
 

567
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:59,600
you can find vulnerabilities and like
CVD for but the CVD database and it can

568
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,610
CVD for but the CVD database and it can
 

569
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,890
CVD for but the CVD database and it can
say oh yeah

570
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:01,900
say oh yeah
 

571
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,770
say oh yeah
this threesome wish to see if their

572
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:04,780
this threesome wish to see if their
 

573
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,650
this threesome wish to see if their
missed out you know IOT thermostats this

574
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:07,660
missed out you know IOT thermostats this
 

575
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,320
missed out you know IOT thermostats this
thermostat has this vulnerability that

576
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,330
thermostat has this vulnerability that
 

577
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,960
thermostat has this vulnerability that
hasn't been patched yet and access

to temperature or kill it or damage to
 

583
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,390
to temperature or kill it or damage to
thermostat and then you can because you

584
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:21,400
thermostat and then you can because you
 

585
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,890
thermostat and then you can because you
have accessed the modem you can open

586
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:22,900
have accessed the modem you can open
 

587
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,110
have accessed the modem you can open
that porch so you can access it yourself

588
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
that porch so you can access it yourself
 

589
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,970
that porch so you can access it yourself
even if you weren't able to before

even if you weren't able to before
 

591
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,530
even if you weren't able to before
can I didn't put something out there

592
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:28,540
can I didn't put something out there
 

593
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,810
can I didn't put something out there
because you touched on thermostats here

594
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:30,820
because you touched on thermostats here
 

595
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,830

I could also as a hacker monitor that

598
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:35,560
I could also as a hacker monitor that
 

599
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,980
I could also as a hacker monitor that
thermostat and see when the people are

600
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:37,990
thermostat and see when the people are
 

601
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,900
thermostat and see when the people are
coming and going so then it brings it

602
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:39,910
coming and going so then it brings it
 

603
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,150
coming and going so then it brings it
into a physical realm of saying okay

604
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
into a physical realm of saying okay
 

605
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,090
into a physical realm of saying okay
well my nest thermostat tells whoever

606
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,100
well my nest thermostat tells whoever
 

607
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,040
well my nest thermostat tells whoever
has access to it whether I'm home or not

609
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,040
has access to it whether I'm home or not
yeah so what if I was a physical robber

610
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,050
yeah so what if I was a physical robber
 

611
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,620
yeah so what if I was a physical robber
it's definitely a scary world all that

612
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:57,630
it's definitely a scary world all that

many hackers would utilize these types

870
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:31,850
many hackers would utilize these types
 

871
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,790
many hackers would utilize these types
of exploits for example I mean you're

872
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:33,800
of exploits for example I mean you're
 

873
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,500
of exploits for example I mean you're
talking about sending you've already

talking about sending you've already
 

875
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,300
talking about sending you've already
sent to over a hundred thousand printers

876
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,310
sent to over a hundred thousand printers
 

877
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,780
sent to over a hundred thousand printers
print out jobs okay and now we're

878
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:40,790
print out jobs okay and now we're
 

879
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,100
print out jobs okay and now we're
talking about the next wave being

another five hundred thousand printers
 

883
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,830
another five hundred thousand printers
where a lot of hackers would just like

884
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
where a lot of hackers would just like
 

885
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,750
where a lot of hackers would just like
hey let's print out a mass amount of

886
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
hey let's print out a mass amount of
 

887
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,790
hey let's print out a mass amount of
porn on all these business printers

888
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:51,800
porn on all these business printers
 

889
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,820
porn on all these business printers
let's like print out some some horrible

890
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:54,830
let's like print out some some horrible
 

891
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,370
let's like print out some some horrible
things this is you know the approach of

892
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:57,380
things this is you know the approach of
 

893
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,280
things this is you know the approach of
the traditional hacker and this is how I

894
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,290
the traditional hacker and this is how I
 

895
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,840
the traditional hacker and this is how I
think media has painted the hacker so we

896
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:04,850
think media has painted the hacker so we
 

897
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,880
think media has painted the hacker so we
have this picture of what a hacker is

898
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:06,890
have this picture of what a hacker is
 

899
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,460
have this picture of what a hacker is
and that's what we expect of them what

900
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:09,470
and that's what we expect of them what
 

901
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,950
and that's what we expect of them what
has caused you to take a different

has caused you to take a different
 

903
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,090
has caused you to take a different
approach and instead send to 600,000

904
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,100
approach and instead send to 600,000
 

905
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,170
approach and instead send to 600,000
printers instructions and assistance

906
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:20,180
printers instructions and assistance
 

907
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:35,460
printers instructions and assistance
with helping to close these exploits

908
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,470

 

909
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,500

necessarily mean that you have to print
 

1749
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,710
necessarily mean that you have to print
it on a piece of paper which is

1750
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:17,720
it on a piece of paper which is
 

1751
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,980
it on a piece of paper which is
susceptible to everything yeah a paper

wallet think about it this way an
 

1755
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,100
wallet think about it this way an
offline wallet right like it could be an

1756
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:27,110
offline wallet right like it could be an

so the question becomes okay so think

1864
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:11,630
so the question becomes okay so think
 

1865
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,749
so the question becomes okay so think
about it where are your keys okay so if

1866
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:13,759
about it where are your keys okay so if
 

1867
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:15,370
about it where are your keys okay so if
you collect cryptocurrency where are

1868
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:15,380
you collect cryptocurrency where are
 

1869
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,039
you collect cryptocurrency where are
your keys how are they safe do you have

1870
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:18,049
your keys how are they safe do you have
 

1871
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:21,069
your keys how are they safe do you have
a device like a data traveler 2000 from

00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:21,079
a device like a data traveler 2000 from
 

1873
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,120
a device like a data traveler 2000 from
Kingston I have one and if not get one

1874
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,130
Kingston I have one and if not get one
 

1875
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,440
Kingston I have one and if not get one
okay because this is a great device

1876
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:26,450
okay because this is a great device
 

1877
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,630
okay because this is a great device
two-storey keys on but I wouldn't just I

1878
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
two-storey keys on but I wouldn't just I
 

1879
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,539
two-storey keys on but I wouldn't just I
wouldn't just put my files on here I

1880
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:31,549
wouldn't just put my files on here I
 

1881
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:33,489
wouldn't just put my files on here I
would also encrypt those files with GPG

1882
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:33,499
would also encrypt those files with GPG
 

1883
00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:36,039
would also encrypt those files with GPG
right so you've got multiple layers of

1884
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:36,049
right so you've got multiple layers of
 

1885
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:38,559
right so you've got multiple layers of
encryption and heck if you want to Luc's

1886
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:38,569
encryption and heck if you want to Luc's
 

1887
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:39,969
encryption and heck if you want to Luc's
encrypt this as well

1888
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:39,979
encrypt this as well
 

1889
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:42,700
encrypt this as well
triple layer encryption that's fine and

1890
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:42,710
triple layer encryption that's fine and
 

1891
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,410
triple layer encryption that's fine and
then you can back that up to multiple

1892
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:44,420
then you can back that up to multiple
 

1893
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,190
then you can back that up to multiple
devices create a DD image I don't care

1894
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:48,200

I'm smart enough yeah you're smart
enough to make that decision so there

2338
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:20,110
enough to make that decision so there
 

2339
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:24,930
enough to make that decision so there
should be a process that Firefox has for

2340
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:24,940
should be a process that Firefox has for
 

2341

should be a process that Firefox has for
some reason forgotten to put into place

some reason forgotten to put into place
 

2343
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:31,080
some reason forgotten to put into place
there should be a process of qualifying

actually need to override for them right
 

2351
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:45,930
