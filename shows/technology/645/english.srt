currently pay it just yeah it's not an
option it's not an option and and for

1192
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:38,500
option it's not an option and and for

know that it's just a square it's a
 

1197
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,889
know that it's just a square it's a
square in a big building and we're the

square in a big building and we're the
 

1199
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,460
square in a big building and we're the
only tenant and that's what it boils

1200
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,470
only tenant and that's what it boils
 

1201
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,380
only tenant and that's what it boils
down to it boils down to they just want

wonder what kind of Internet we're gonna

2642
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:44,430
wonder what kind of Internet we're gonna
 

2643
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:48,890
wonder what kind of Internet we're gonna
have it studio e from the previous one

2644
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:48,900
have it studio e from the previous one
 

2645
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:55,339

out there 16 megabits down as we're

2646
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:55,349
out there 16 megabits down as we're
 

2647
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,289
out there 16 megabits down as we're
looking at studio a I have to look at

2648
01:04:57,289 --> 01:04:57,299
looking at studio a I have to look at
 

2649
01:04:57,299 --> 01:04:59,150
looking at studio a I have to look at
like what kind of internet is available

2650
01:04:59,150 --> 01:04:59,160
like what kind of internet is available
 

2651
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,740
like what kind of internet is available
and we're talking about you know do they

2652
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:00,750
and we're talking about you know do they
 

2653
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,940
and we're talking about you know do they
have 100 megabit and 250 megabit and

2654
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:03,950
have 100 megabit and 250 megabit and
 

2655
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,759
have 100 megabit and 250 megabit and
gigabit ethernet and it's like it really

2656
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:07,769
gigabit ethernet and it's like it really
 

2657
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:10,309
gigabit ethernet and it's like it really
reminds me how far technology has come

2658
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:10,319
reminds me how far technology has come
 

2659
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,859
reminds me how far technology has come
because hey when we moved in here it was

2660
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:12,869
because hey when we moved in here it was
 

2661
01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:16,910
because hey when we moved in here it was
like 20 Meg's was fantastic yeah well I

2662
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:16,920
like 20 Meg's was fantastic yeah well I
 

2663
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,769
like 20 Meg's was fantastic yeah well I
mean because we were here we also had

2664
01:05:18,769 --> 01:05:18,779
mean because we were here we also had
 

2665
01:05:18,779 --> 01:05:20,900
mean because we were here we also had
like we had to have the line-of-sight

2666
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:20,910
like we had to have the line-of-sight
 

2667
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,430
like we had to have the line-of-sight
transmission there for a bit where we

2668
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:22,440
transmission there for a bit where we
 

2669
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,740
transmission there for a bit where we
had the thing in the hall right yeah

2670
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:24,750
had the thing in the hall right yeah
 

2671
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,049
had the thing in the hall right yeah
we've got the antenna easy stuff here

2672
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:27,059
we've got the antenna easy stuff here
 

2673
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:27,499
we've got the antenna easy stuff here
yeah

2674
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:27,509
yeah
 

2675
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:30,499
yeah
and now now we have an antenna ubiquity

2676
01:05:30,499 --> 01:05:30,509
and now now we have an antenna ubiquity
 

2677
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,930
and now now we have an antenna ubiquity
on the roof yeah yeah that's pointed at

2678
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:32,940
on the roof yeah yeah that's pointed at
 

2679
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,690
on the roof yeah yeah that's pointed at
a tower across the way mm-hmm good times

2680
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:37,700

 

2681
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:43,240

so yeah you need to leave that behind

2682
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:43,250
so yeah you need to leave that behind
 

2683
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,760
so yeah you need to leave that behind
what's that the antenna it's which which

2684
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:46,770
what's that the antenna it's which which
 

2685
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,890
what's that the antenna it's which which
one the on the roof that's not the one

2686
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:48,900
one the on the roof that's not the one
 

2687
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,410
one the on the roof that's not the one
that we currently have Sol boo yeah yeah

2688
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:51,420
that we currently have Sol boo yeah yeah
 

2689
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,300
that we currently have Sol boo yeah yeah
the one that we currently have is a

2690
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:53,310
the one that we currently have is a
 

2691
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:58,880
the one that we currently have is a
ubiquity like a an access point I guess

2692
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:58,890
ubiquity like a an access point I guess
 

2693
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,460
ubiquity like a an access point I guess
like they're like point-to-point fiber I

2694
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:01,470
like they're like point-to-point fiber I
 

2695
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:07,160
like they're like point-to-point fiber I
think they are and there's a cellular

2696
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,170
think they are and there's a cellular
 

2697
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:12,320
think they are and there's a cellular
phone company about two hundred yards

2698
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:12,330
phone company about two hundred yards
 

2699
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:15,890
phone company about two hundred yards
away from us and they have a tower on

2700
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:15,900
away from us and they have a tower on
 

2701
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,450
away from us and they have a tower on
their roof and that tower has the other

2702
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:19,460
their roof and that tower has the other
 

2703
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,400
their roof and that tower has the other
ubiquity and so where's the law really

2704
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:22,410
ubiquity and so where's the law really
 

2705
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:26,540
ubiquity and so where's the law really
hey I go moto so we're actually tapping

2706
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:26,550
hey I go moto so we're actually tapping
 

2707
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,410
hey I go moto so we're actually tapping
into their internet 200 yards away using

2708
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:30,420
into their internet 200 yards away using
 

2709
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:45,860
into their internet 200 yards away using
a ubiquity wireless connection I see no

2710
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:45,870
a ubiquity wireless connection I see no
 

2711
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:49,210
a ubiquity wireless connection I see no
it belongs to the ISP yeah so I'm gonna

2712
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:49,220
it belongs to the ISP yeah so I'm gonna
 

2713
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,710
it belongs to the ISP yeah so I'm gonna
I'll be honest I haven't contacted the

ISP yet because I don't want them to

2716
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,000

01:16:59,500 --> 01:16:59,510
so there was the odd time where we would
 

3049
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:04,000
so there was the odd time where we would
pre record a show it's very rare and and

3050
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,010
pre record a show it's very rare and and
 

3051
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,800
pre record a show it's very rare and and
people say well why don't you pre record

3052
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:05,810
people say well why don't you pre record
 

3053
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,600
people say well why don't you pre record
more shows and then you can have more

3054
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:07,610
more shows and then you can have more
 

3055
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:10,000
more shows and then you can have more
time off but it's actually more work to

3056
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,010
time off but it's actually more work to
 

3057
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,280
time off but it's actually more work to
pre-record than it is to do it live yeah

3058
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:12,290
pre-record than it is to do it live yeah
 

3059

the on-demand versus the live but it

3114
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:44,480
the on-demand versus the live but it
 

3115
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,900
the on-demand versus the live but it
makes the show more interesting and and

3116
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:46,910
makes the show more interesting and and
 

3117
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:49,240
makes the show more interesting and and
it allows me to punch in on that 4k shot

3118
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:49,250
it allows me to punch in on that 4k shot
 

3119
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,310
it allows me to punch in on that 4k shot
because our broadcast once it's on

3120
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:51,320
because our broadcast once it's on
 

3121
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:55,479
because our broadcast once it's on
demand is 2k so we have basically I can

3122
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:55,489
demand is 2k so we have basically I can
 

3123
01:18:55,489 --> 01:18:58,660
demand is 2k so we have basically I can
punch in to a half of the the screen

3124
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:58,670
punch in to a half of the the screen
 

3125
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:02,740
punch in to a half of the the screen
size that the camera provides so oh yeah

3126
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:02,750
size that the camera provides so oh yeah
 

3127
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:06,640
size that the camera provides so oh yeah
so all of our cameras are 4k and those

3128
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:06,650
so all of our cameras are 4k and those
 

3129
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:09,400
so all of our cameras are 4k and those
allow us to punch in and basically zoom

3130
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:09,410
allow us to punch in and basically zoom
 

3131
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,560
allow us to punch in and basically zoom
in on the camera without having to have

3132
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:11,570
in on the camera without having to have
 

3133
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:14,830
in on the camera without having to have
a camera operator yeah works pretty well

3134
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:14,840
a camera operator yeah works pretty well
 

3135
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,209
a camera operator yeah works pretty well
I think for on-demand yeah so I can't I

3136
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:19,219
I think for on-demand yeah so I can't I
 

3137
01:19:19,219 --> 01:19:21,700
I think for on-demand yeah so I can't I
can't record at 720 our master

3138
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:21,710
can't record at 720 our master
 

3139
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,979
can't record at 720 our master
recordings have to be huge they have to

3140
01:19:23,979 --> 01:19:23,989
recordings have to be huge they have to
 

3141
01:19:23,989 --> 01:19:27,970
recordings have to be huge they have to
be and then I render down from that how

3142
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:27,980
be and then I render down from that how
 

3143
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,010
be and then I render down from that how
big is the must recording for up typical

3144
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:30,020
big is the must recording for up typical
 

3145
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:36,580
big is the must recording for up typical
initial six hundred gigabytes yeah

initial six hundred gigabytes yeah
 

3147
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:41,370
initial six hundred gigabytes yeah
that's something that's a very big file

3148
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:41,380
