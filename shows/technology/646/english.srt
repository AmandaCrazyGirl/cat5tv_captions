281
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,990
was always thinking so when the audience
seating was certainly unused so we ended

282
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,000
seating was certainly unused so we ended
 

283

336
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
been a weird time for all of us and here
 

337
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,569
been a weird time for all of us and here
at studio D it's it's no exception

338
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:18,579
at studio D it's it's no exception

00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,970
at studio D it's it's no exception
getting insurance has been odd for

340
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:21,980
getting insurance has been odd for
 

341
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,370
getting insurance has been odd for
studio II because my insurance broker

342
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:24,380
studio II because my insurance broker
 

343
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,730
studio II because my insurance broker
has shut down because of kovat 19 so

344
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:27,740
has shut down because of kovat 19 so
 

345
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,650
has shut down because of kovat 19 so
they're working from home they're doing

346
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:29,660
they're working from home they're doing
 

347
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,889
they're working from home they're doing
things like esign and and taking much

348
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:32,899
things like esign and and taking much
 

349
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,139
things like esign and and taking much
more time than it should take to get a

350
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:35,149
more time than it should take to get a
 

351
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,350
more time than it should take to get a
quote and so that's been really really

352
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:38,360
quote and so that's been really really
 

353
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,449
quote and so that's been really really
difficult for me it's been probably the

354
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:40,459
difficult for me it's been probably the
 

355
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,420
difficult for me it's been probably the
biggest stress that I've had beyond the

356
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,430
biggest stress that I've had beyond the
 

357
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,990
biggest stress that I've had beyond the
actual eviction just realizing that okay

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,970
the the limits are that there can only
be one hundred people per meeting and

780
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:26,980
be one hundred people per meeting and
 

781
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,990
be one hundred people per meeting and
the the limit is timed to 40 minutes but

782
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,000
the the limit is timed to 40 minutes but
 

783
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,850
the the limit is timed to 40 minutes but
I did find that the last one they

784
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:32,860
I did find that the last one they
 

785
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,340
I did find that the last one they
started cutting me off at 30 Oh

786
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,350

 

787
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,950

so 100 is not bad actually yeah

788
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
so 100 is not bad actually yeah
 

789
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,660
so 100 is not bad actually yeah
so from studio yeah from studio II we

790
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:45,670
so from studio yeah from studio II we
 

791
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,930
so from studio yeah from studio II we
could have a fair few people

792
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:47,940
could have a fair few people
 

793
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,230
could have a fair few people
participating in our zoom meeting and we

794
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
participating in our zoom meeting and we
 

795
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,110
participating in our zoom meeting and we
could make that maybe just like a

796
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,120
could make that maybe just like a
 

797
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,260
could make that maybe just like a
portion of the one hour show you know

798
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,270
portion of the one hour show you know
 

799
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,720
portion of the one hour show you know
what would be fun actually I know I'm

800
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:00,730
what would be fun actually I know I'm
 

801
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,280
what would be fun actually I know I'm
just pitching an idea for an episode in

802
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,290
just pitching an idea for an episode in
 

803
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,200
just pitching an idea for an episode in
the future yes but could you imagine if

804
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,210
the future yes but could you imagine if
 

805
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,060
the future yes but could you imagine if
like a certain number of people had

806
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,070
like a certain number of people had
 

807
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,010
like a certain number of people had
exactly the same product and we were

808
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,020
exactly the same product and we were
 

809
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,080
exactly the same product and we were
doing like an unboxing a simultaneous

810
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,090

 

811
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:24,060

that would be so much fun that would be

812
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,070
that would be so much fun that would be
 

813
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,380
that would be so much fun that would be
a lot of fun I don't think that's been

814
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:25,390
a lot of fun I don't think that's been
 

815
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:45,930
a lot of fun I don't think that's been
done before I met everybody can come up

I'll take 100 of those rivaling this
tops now in terms of power that's crazy

824
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:08,560
tops now in terms of power that's crazy
 

825
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,880
