00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:16,549
physically distant because now as a part
 

1205
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,639
physically distant because now as a part
of the show in order to maintain you

1206
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:18,649
of the show in order to maintain you
 

1207

of the show in order to maintain you
know the connections I've made I am

1208
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,010
know the connections I've made I am
 

1209
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,649
know the connections I've made I am
going to turn a part of the house into a

2033
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,690
networking and so on trade and sales
it's a big one support help desk and so

2034
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:30,700
it's a big one support help desk and so
 

2035
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,660
it's a big one support help desk and so
on legal compliance and my favorite is

2036
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:33,670
on legal compliance and my favorite is
 

2037
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,700
on legal compliance and my favorite is
development and that's what I want to

2038
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:35,710
development and that's what I want to
 

2039
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,610
development and that's what I want to
focus on where are a technology Channel

2040
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:38,620
focus on where are a technology Channel
 

2041
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,250
focus on where are a technology Channel
and so that's why I would like to focus

2042
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:41,260
and so that's why I would like to focus
 

2043
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,200
and so that's why I would like to focus
more on development so if you don't know

2044
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,210
more on development so if you don't know
 

2045
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,910
more on development so if you don't know
anything about programming don't worry

2046
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:44,920
anything about programming don't worry
 

2047
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,410
anything about programming don't worry
about it this this is your moment here

2048
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:48,420
about it this this is your moment here
 

2049
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,650
about it this this is your moment here
and so what you'll see behind me is a

2050
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:52,660
and so what you'll see behind me is a
 

2051
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,260
and so what you'll see behind me is a
step-by-step idea on how you can get

2052
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,270
step-by-step idea on how you can get
 

2053
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,960
step-by-step idea on how you can get
into this market how you can find a job

2054
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:57,970
into this market how you can find a job
 

2055
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,180
into this market how you can find a job
in this industry and so the first step

2056
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:00,190
in this industry and so the first step
 

2057
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,500
in this industry and so the first step
if you don't know anything about a

2058
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:01,510
if you don't know anything about a
 

2059
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,150
if you don't know anything about a
programming language is learning a

2060
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,160
programming language is learning a
 

2061
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,140
programming language is learning a
programming language

2062
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,150
programming language
 

2063
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,170
programming language
now it's not difficult within a day you

2064
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:07,180
now it's not difficult within a day you
 

2065
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,390
now it's not difficult within a day you
know the basics it's really easy to do

2066
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:09,400
know the basics it's really easy to do
 

2067
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,100
know the basics it's really easy to do
that it's all about logic if you can't

2068
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,110
that it's all about logic if you can't
 

2069
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,520
that it's all about logic if you can't
think in a logical way then learning a

2070
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:14,530
think in a logical way then learning a
 

2071
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,260
think in a logical way then learning a
programming language is something very

2072
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:16,270
programming language is something very
 

2073
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,940
programming language is something very
easy and I would start with JavaScript

2074
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:17,950
easy and I would start with JavaScript
 

2075
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,650
easy and I would start with JavaScript
and they're all by the way very similar

2076
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:19,660
and they're all by the way very similar
 

2077
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,570
and they're all by the way very similar
so there's no big differences between

2078
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:21,580
so there's no big differences between
 

2079
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,090
so there's no big differences between
one language and the other I would start

2080
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:24,100
one language and the other I would start
 

2081
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,790
one language and the other I would start
with JavaScript because you can develop

2082
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
with JavaScript because you can develop
 

2083
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,600
with JavaScript because you can develop
something that is easily visible on a

2084
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:30,610
something that is easily visible on a
 

2085
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:35,040
something that is easily visible on a
screen or so and then if you know

2086
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,050
screen or so and then if you know
 

2087
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,590
screen or so and then if you know
JavaScript I would go over into Python

2088
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:37,600
JavaScript I would go over into Python
 

2089
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,380
JavaScript I would go over into Python
because that's what a lot of crypto

2090
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:40,390
because that's what a lot of crypto
 

2091
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:44,280
because that's what a lot of crypto
