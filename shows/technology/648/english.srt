and it's a mirror so it's constantly

226
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:06,889
and it's a mirror so it's constantly
 

227
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,820
and it's a mirror so it's constantly
being mirrored to multiple hard drives

being mirrored to multiple hard drives
 

229
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,560
being mirrored to multiple hard drives
then we've got our audio rack up here so

230
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:11,570
then we've got our audio rack up here so
 

231
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,270
then we've got our audio rack up here so
as you can see audio is happening right

232
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
as you can see audio is happening right
 

233
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,940
as you can see audio is happening right
now as I speak so I'm speaking on a

234
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:15,950
now as I speak so I'm speaking on a
 

235
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,490
now as I speak so I'm speaking on a
lapel tonight as opposed to the headsets

236
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:18,500
lapel tonight as opposed to the headsets
 

237
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,790
lapel tonight as opposed to the headsets
that we used to use and it comes into

238
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:21,800
that we used to use and it comes into
 

239
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,710
that we used to use and it comes into
our audio rig so here's the audio

240
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:23,720
our audio rig so here's the audio
 

241
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,500
our audio rig so here's the audio
receivers for my mic pack so it is

242
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:26,510
receivers for my mic pack so it is
 

243
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,300
receivers for my mic pack so it is
wireless and these are the antennas for

244
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,310
wireless and these are the antennas for
 

245
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,010
wireless and these are the antennas for
that which are able to get through the

246
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,020
that which are able to get through the
 

247
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,140
that which are able to get through the
wall just no prob

248
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,150
wall just no prob
 

249
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,980
wall just no prob
at all just like buttah and then we've

250
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:34,990
at all just like buttah and then we've
 

251
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,620
at all just like buttah and then we've
got an ultra miser Pro audio processor

252
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:37,630
got an ultra miser Pro audio processor
 

253
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,270
got an ultra miser Pro audio processor
which is a compressor so that makes sure

254
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
which is a compressor so that makes sure
 

255
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,130
which is a compressor so that makes sure
that I'm not too loud not too quiet

256
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,140
that I'm not too loud not too quiet
 

257
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,840
that I'm not too loud not too quiet
then we've got a sonic Maximizer from

258
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:42,850
then we've got a sonic Maximizer from
 

259
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,960
then we've got a sonic Maximizer from
BBE which is essentially that is an

260
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:45,970
BBE which is essentially that is an
 

261
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,080
BBE which is essentially that is an
audio exciter so we we add a little bit

262
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,090
audio exciter so we we add a little bit
 

263
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,030
audio exciter so we we add a little bit
of Christmas to the sound with this unit

264
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,040
of Christmas to the sound with this unit
 

265
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,410
of Christmas to the sound with this unit
here if I turn that off you're going to

266
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:52,420
here if I turn that off you're going to
 

267
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,600
here if I turn that off you're going to
notice the difference so watch this now

notice the difference so watch this now
 

269
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,630
notice the difference so watch this now
it is off and you can immediately hear

270
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:57,640
it is off and you can immediately hear
 

271
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,800
it is off and you can immediately hear
that it's just not as sweet and in the

272
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:01,810
that it's just not as sweet and in the
 

273
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,320
that it's just not as sweet and in the
industry we call that Christmas but it's

274
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,330
industry we call that Christmas but it's
 

275
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,180
industry we call that Christmas but it's
that's it's that little shimmer on the

276
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,190
that's it's that little shimmer on the
 

277
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,370
that's it's that little shimmer on the
on the microphone so when I turn that

278
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:08,380
on the microphone so when I turn that
 

279
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,340
on the microphone so when I turn that
back on now it's back on and now you can

280
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,350
back on now it's back on and now you can
 

281
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,840
back on now it's back on and now you can
hear the difference and then this guy

282
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:12,850
hear the difference and then this guy
 

283
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,660
hear the difference and then this guy
here from American audio is just simply

284
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,670
here from American audio is just simply
 

285
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,760
here from American audio is just simply
so that I can see that our mics are

286
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:17,770
so that I can see that our mics are
 

287
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,300
so that I can see that our mics are
working that's just a vu volume unit

288
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,310
working that's just a vu volume unit
 

289
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,150
working that's just a vu volume unit
indicator and and that kind of is

290
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
indicator and and that kind of is
 

291
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,370
indicator and and that kind of is
everything that goes on there but over

292
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:26,380
everything that goes on there but over
 

293
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,640
everything that goes on there but over
here which you can't see is our entire

294
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:29,650
here which you can't see is our entire
 

295
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,190
here which you can't see is our entire
audio rack so this is where the task cam

296
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,200
audio rack so this is where the task cam
 

297
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,580
audio rack so this is where the task cam
is so so everything is going through a

298
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:35,590
is so so everything is going through a
 

299
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,470
is so so everything is going through a
mixer over here I will show you in a

300
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:37,480
mixer over here I will show you in a
 

301
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,920
mixer over here I will show you in a
virtual tour in time as we kind of get

302
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:40,930
virtual tour in time as we kind of get
 

303
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,620
virtual tour in time as we kind of get
things set up but so all that to say

304

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,350
have access to everything so the only
 

453
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,530
have access to everything so the only
limitation that you have with a micro

454
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:22,540
limitation that you have with a micro
 

455

tech is the hardware lucky for us they

456
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,280
tech is the hardware lucky for us they
 

457
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,470
tech is the hardware lucky for us they
have a gajillion of these kind of

458
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:31,480
have a gajillion of these kind of
 

459
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,130
have a gajillion of these kind of
devices they've got a a wide range of

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,140
devices they've got a a wide range of
 

461
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,240
devices they've got a a wide range of
hardware available to us so with micro

462
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,250
hardware available to us so with micro
 

463
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,960

tech the approach is instead to simply

464
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:42,970
tech the approach is instead to simply
 

465
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,060
tech the approach is instead to simply
find the hardware that's going to meet

466
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,070
find the hardware that's going to meet
 

467
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,610
find the hardware that's going to meet
your needs so the reason that I've

468
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:47,620
your needs so the reason that I've
 

469
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,380
your needs so the reason that I've
selected this one for the studio is

470
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,390
selected this one for the studio is
 

471
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,360
selected this one for the studio is
because we have one two three four

472
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,370
because we have one two three four
 

473
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:01,310
because we have one two three four
Gigabit Ethernet ports we've got a gig

474
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:01,320

 

475
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,050

port for connecting uplink to our modem

476
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,060
port for connecting uplink to our modem
 

477
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,730
port for connecting uplink to our modem
it's got two point four and five

478
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:08,740
it's got two point four and five
 

479
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,340
it's got two point four and five
gigahertz radios so I'm gonna be able to

480
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,350
gigahertz radios so I'm gonna be able to
 

481
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,340
gigahertz radios so I'm gonna be able to
kind of branch out and you know like our

482
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,350
kind of branch out and you know like our
 

483
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,800
kind of branch out and you know like our
wise cams for example are on the 2.4

484
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:16,810
wise cams for example are on the 2.4
 

485
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,870
wise cams for example are on the 2.4
gigahertz band so I'll leave those there

486
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
gigahertz band so I'll leave those there
 

487
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,910
gigahertz band so I'll leave those there
but I want to bring my smart phone and

488
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:20,920
but I want to bring my smart phone and
 

489
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,310
but I want to bring my smart phone and
our laptops and everything over to five

490
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,320
our laptops and everything over to five
 

491
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,900
our laptops and everything over to five
gigahertz because we're gonna get more

492
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:24,910
gigahertz because we're gonna get more
 

493
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,600
gigahertz because we're gonna get more
speed and then we're gonna presumably be

494
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:27,610
speed and then we're gonna presumably be
 

495
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,870
speed and then we're gonna presumably be
able to free up that that 2.4 gigahertz

496
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
able to free up that that 2.4 gigahertz
 

497
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,530
able to free up that that 2.4 gigahertz
band you're at the studio there are a

498
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:34,540
band you're at the studio there are a
 

499
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,700
band you're at the studio there are a
couple of different things that are

500
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:35,710
couple of different things that are
 

501
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,380
couple of different things that are
really really neat about this device I

502
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,390
really really neat about this device I
 

503
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,660
really really neat about this device I
mean they are really really hard core

504
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:39,670
mean they are really really hard core
 

505
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,630
mean they are really really hard core
good quality but they are about a tenth

506
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:42,640
good quality but they are about a tenth
 

507
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,810
good quality but they are about a tenth
of what you would expect to pay for

508
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:45,820
of what you would expect to pay for
 

509
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,000
of what you would expect to pay for
similar features and I really really

510
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,010
similar features and I really really
 

511
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,400
similar features and I really really
mean that I mean you'll notice on the

512
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,410
mean that I mean you'll notice on the
 

513
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,710
mean that I mean you'll notice on the
side there's a USB port one of the first

514
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
side there's a USB port one of the first
 

515
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,230
side there's a USB port one of the first
things that I ever did with a router

516
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,240
things that I ever did with a router
 

517
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,370
things that I ever did with a router
board is I used that USB port which by

518
00:12:59,370 --> 00:12:59,380
board is I used that USB port which by
 

519
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,930
board is I used that USB port which by
software because it's not limited

520
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:00,940
software because it's not limited
 

521
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,879
software because it's not limited
remember so I wrote a script

522
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:04,889
remember so I wrote a script
 

523
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,739
remember so I wrote a script
that could turn on and off the power to

524
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:09,749
that could turn on and off the power to
 

525
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:13,389
that could turn on and off the power to
the USB port why would I want to do that

526
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:13,399
the USB port why would I want to do that
 

527
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,460
the USB port why would I want to do that
well USB is how many volts 5 volts I

528
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,470
well USB is how many volts 5 volts I
 

529
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,769
well USB is how many volts 5 volts I
picked up a 5 volt relay and I set it up

530
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:24,779
picked up a 5 volt relay and I set it up
 

531
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,159
picked up a 5 volt relay and I set it up
so that a USB cable went into that relay

532
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,169
so that a USB cable went into that relay
 

533
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:31,789
so that a USB cable went into that relay
and I could in the software turn off and

534
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:31,799
and I could in the software turn off and
 

535
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,099
and I could in the software turn off and
on the power to that relay basically

536
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:34,109
on the power to that relay basically
 

537
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:37,309
on the power to that relay basically
tripping the circuit so that relay then

538
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:37,319
tripping the circuit so that relay then
 

539
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:40,309
tripping the circuit so that relay then
had the power cable which was 12 volts

540
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:40,319
had the power cable which was 12 volts
 

541
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:45,349
had the power cable which was 12 volts

I'm going to cut the power on the USB

562
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:09,720
I'm going to cut the power on the USB
 

563
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,650
I'm going to cut the power on the USB
port and what that then did is it cut

564
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:12,660
port and what that then did is it cut
 

565
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,419
port and what that then did is it cut
the power on the relay which tripped the

566
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:17,429
the power on the relay which tripped the
 

567
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:21,729
the power on the relay which tripped the
12-volt signal to turn off my modem and

568
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:21,739
12-volt signal to turn off my modem and
 

569
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:25,280
12-volt signal to turn off my modem and
then it waited five seconds I programmed

570
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,290
then it waited five seconds I programmed
 

571
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,879
then it waited five seconds I programmed
that into this and then fired it back up

572
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:28,889
that into this and then fired it back up
 

573
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,559
that into this and then fired it back up
again the relay trip back

574
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:30,569
again the relay trip back
 

575
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,629
again the relay trip back
the modem powered back on and

576
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
the modem powered back on and
 

577
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,850
the modem powered back on and
essentially what I had done is I've

578
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:34,860
essentially what I had done is I've
 

579
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,220
essentially what I had done is I've
unplugged and plugged back in my modem

580
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,230
unplugged and plugged back in my modem
 

581
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,749
unplugged and plugged back in my modem

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,470
problem at the time with my particular
 

591
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,369
problem at the time with my particular
modem I would have to power cycle that

592
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:49,379
modem I would have to power cycle that
 

593
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,859
modem I would have to power cycle that
modem basically like once every few

594
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:51,869
modem basically like once every few
 

595
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,439
modem basically like once every few
weeks but by using a micro tech I was

596
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:54,449
weeks but by using a micro tech I was
 

597
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,419
weeks but by using a micro tech I was
able to do that programmatically using

598
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:56,429
able to do that programmatically using
 

599
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,699
able to do that programmatically using
the USB port so all that to say it's

600
00:14:58,699 --> 00:14:58,709
the USB port so all that to say it's
 

601
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,519
the USB port so all that to say it's
completely open in such a way that I can

difference but what happens if there's a
 

1851
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,340
difference but what happens if there's a
crash then the difference between those

1852
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,350
crash then the difference between those
 

1853
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,190
crash then the difference between those
exchanges will be substantial and that

1854
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
exchanges will be substantial and that
 

1855
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,620

to change smart contracts idea they
 

1873
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,170
to change smart contracts idea they
initially had that and the base layer

1874

initially had that and the base layer
 

1875
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,560
initially had that and the base layer
and they chew moving that now to layer

1876
