echo but in this room you can hear

318
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,150
echo but in this room you can hear
 

319
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,360
echo but in this room you can hear
there's a lot of ambient noise from the

320
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,370
there's a lot of ambient noise from the
 

321
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,700
there's a lot of ambient noise from the
server rack that's behind me it's really

322
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,710
server rack that's behind me it's really
 

323
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,470
server rack that's behind me it's really
important that runs the show it keeps

324
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:17,480
important that runs the show it keeps
 

325
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,600
important that runs the show it keeps
everything going it runs a lot of our

326
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:19,610
everything going it runs a lot of our
 

327
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,850
everything going it runs a lot of our
services and our internal infrastructure

328
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:21,860
services and our internal infrastructure
 

329
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,100
services and our internal infrastructure
however it is generating a lot of noise

330
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,110
however it is generating a lot of noise
 

331
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,450
however it is generating a lot of noise
and a fair bit of heat this is the

332
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:25,460
and a fair bit of heat this is the
 

333
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,800
and a fair bit of heat this is the
warmest room in the house I'll tell you

334
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:26,810
warmest room in the house I'll tell you
 

335
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,460
warmest room in the house I'll tell you
that but it's pretty noisy and so what

336
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,470
that but it's pretty noisy and so what
 

337
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,180
that but it's pretty noisy and so what
I've done this week look is I have set

338
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,190
I've done this week look is I have set
 

339
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:41,470
I've done this week look is I have set
down a h4n this is a zoom h4n which I've

340
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:41,480
down a h4n this is a zoom h4n which I've
 

341
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,590
down a h4n this is a zoom h4n which I've
got on a tripod or a mic stand here this

342
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:44,600
got on a tripod or a mic stand here this
 

343
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,000
got on a tripod or a mic stand here this
is recording with a mic sensitivity of

344
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,010
is recording with a mic sensitivity of
 

345
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,830
is recording with a mic sensitivity of
40 so the the volume level if you have

346
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:50,840
40 so the the volume level if you have
 

347
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,310
40 so the the volume level if you have
an h4 n I've got this set to 40 so it's

348
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:54,320
an h4 n I've got this set to 40 so it's
 

349
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,230
an h4 n I've got this set to 40 so it's
picking up the ambient noise right now

350
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
picking up the ambient noise right now
 

351
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
picking up the ambient noise right now
it's not broadcasting to you I'm going

352
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,250
it's not broadcasting to you I'm going
 

353
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,190
it's not broadcasting to you I'm going
to switch to this microphone in just a

354
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,200
to switch to this microphone in just a
 

355
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,370
to switch to this microphone in just a
second but it's picking up that ambient

356
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:03,380
second but it's picking up that ambient
 

357
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,710
second but it's picking up that ambient
noise so that we can see those levels

358
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:05,720
noise so that we can see those levels
 

359
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,550
noise so that we can see those levels
I've turned off the auto mic levels on

360
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:09,560
I've turned off the auto mic levels on
 

361
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,040
I've turned off the auto mic levels on
the h4 n so what you're gonna get to

362
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,050
the h4 n so what you're gonna get to
 

363
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,250
the h4 n so what you're gonna get to
hear and see visually in goldwave are

364
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,260
hear and see visually in goldwave are
 

365
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,160
hear and see visually in goldwave are
the wave tables directly from this with

366
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,170
the wave tables directly from this with
 

367
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,580
the wave tables directly from this with
no resampling and no changes to the

368
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:21,590
no resampling and no changes to the
 

369
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,050
no resampling and no changes to the
levels so that's exactly the same from

370
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,060
levels so that's exactly the same from
 

371
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,820
levels so that's exactly the same from
point A to point B I mean they're it's

372
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:27,830
point A to point B I mean they're it's
 

373
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,230
point A to point B I mean they're it's
not going to change the levels of the

374
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,240
not going to change the levels of the
 

375
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,180
not going to change the levels of the
microphone that's gonna help us to be

376
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,190
microphone that's gonna help us to be
 

377
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,980
microphone that's gonna help us to be
able to see tonight what kind of a

378
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:32,990
able to see tonight what kind of a
 

379
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,810
able to see tonight what kind of a
difference we can make by changing a

380
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:34,820
difference we can make by changing a
 

381
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,760
difference we can make by changing a
simple fan can attend all our part

382
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:39,770
simple fan can attend all our part
 

383
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,680
simple fan can attend all our part
reduce the noise in such a way that it's

384
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:42,690
reduce the noise in such a way that it's
 

385
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,969
reduce the noise in such a way that it's
actually worth our while

386
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:43,979
actually worth our while
 

387
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,210
actually worth our while
so this is our backup drive it's an a

388
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,220
so this is our backup drive it's an a
 

389
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,030
so this is our backup drive it's an a
raid 3500 dash GP these things are

390
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,040
raid 3500 dash GP these things are
 

391
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,340
raid 3500 dash GP these things are
fantastic it's a mirroring unit so we've

392
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,350
fantastic it's a mirroring unit so we've
 

393
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,590
fantastic it's a mirroring unit so we've
got a master Drive and a secondary Drive

394
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:54,600
got a master Drive and a secondary Drive
 

395
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,810
got a master Drive and a secondary Drive
and I can pull this secondary drive it's

396
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:56,820
and I can pull this secondary drive it's
 

397
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,040
and I can pull this secondary drive it's
a 10 terabyte hard drive I pull that out

398
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,050
a 10 terabyte hard drive I pull that out
 

399
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,050
a 10 terabyte hard drive I pull that out
pop in a different one and a tree images

400
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,060
pop in a different one and a tree images
 

401
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,140
pop in a different one and a tree images
and I have an exact mirror at all times

402
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,150
and I have an exact mirror at all times
 

403
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,300
and I have an exact mirror at all times
of my backup then the server is down

404
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,310
of my backup then the server is down
 

405
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,160
of my backup then the server is down
here and this is actually the storage

406
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,170
here and this is actually the storage
 

407
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,870
here and this is actually the storage
and the Samba shares and everything else

408
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:11,880
and the Samba shares and everything else
 

409
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,540
and the Samba shares and everything else
and that's generating a lot of noise too

410
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:14,550
and that's generating a lot of noise too
 

411
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,590
and that's generating a lot of noise too
so right now let's just check out the

412
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
so right now let's just check out the
 

413
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,810
so right now let's just check out the
levels of everything running the way it

414
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:20,820
levels of everything running the way it
 

415
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,950
levels of everything running the way it
normally would I'm going to shut up for

416
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:21,960
normally would I'm going to shut up for
 

417
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,170
normally would I'm going to shut up for
a second and let you hear that and see

418
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,180
a second and let you hear that and see
 

419
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:37,130
a second and let you hear that and see
that visually

420
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,140

 

421
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,320

okay so that's the ambient noise just

422
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,330
okay so that's the ambient noise just
 

423
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,120
okay so that's the ambient noise just
coming off of everything the server the

424
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,130
coming off of everything the server the
 

425
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,830
coming off of everything the server the
backup everything running I'm gonna halt

426
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:43,840
backup everything running I'm gonna halt
 

427
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,040
backup everything running I'm gonna halt
the server which I've just done let's

428
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,050
the server which I've just done let's
 

429
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:53,250
the server which I've just done let's
listen

430
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,260

 

431
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,900

waiting for it to shut down

432
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:57,910

 

433
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,970

and it's still powered on so I'm going

434
00:09:59,970 --> 00:09:59,980
and it's still powered on so I'm going
 

435
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:15,769
and it's still powered on so I'm going
to now power that off here we go

436
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:15,779

 

437
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,380

okay so with the server off there is a

438
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,390
okay so with the server off there is a
 

439
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,530
okay so with the server off there is a
notable difference but there's still a

440
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:22,540
notable difference but there's still a
 

441
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,720
notable difference but there's still a
lot of noise coming off just the backup

442
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:24,730
lot of noise coming off just the backup
 

443
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:34,420
lot of noise coming off just the backup
unit

444
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:34,430

 

445
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,130

all right so I'm going to power that off

446
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,140
all right so I'm going to power that off
 

447
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:48,210
all right so I'm going to power that off
and we'll see how the room sounds

448
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:48,220

 

449
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,480

what a difference a okay so let's get

450
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,490
what a difference a okay so let's get
 

451
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,220
what a difference a okay so let's get
this out of the way and I'm gonna

452
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,230
this out of the way and I'm gonna
 

453
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,980
this out of the way and I'm gonna
actually remove this backup drive and so

454
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:55,990
actually remove this backup drive and so
 

455
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,600
actually remove this backup drive and so
what I'm gonna do is we're gonna throw a

456
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:57,610
what I'm gonna do is we're gonna throw a
 

457
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,330
what I'm gonna do is we're gonna throw a
little nine dollar fan in here to

458
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:00,340
little nine dollar fan in here to
 

459
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,930
little nine dollar fan in here to
replace the stock fan and the intention

460
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:03,940
replace the stock fan and the intention
 

461
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,470
replace the stock fan and the intention
today it's not a sophisticated tutorial

462
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:07,480
today it's not a sophisticated tutorial
 

463
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,810
today it's not a sophisticated tutorial

often think about is that there are very

468
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:15,850
often think about is that there are very
 

469
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,420
often think about is that there are very
simple and very affordable solutions

470
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,430
simple and very affordable solutions
 

471
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,200
simple and very affordable solutions
that we can put into place that can help

472
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,210
that we can put into place that can help
 

473
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,840
that we can put into place that can help
with this ambient noise it doesn't just

474
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:24,850
with this ambient noise it doesn't just
 

475
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,670
with this ambient noise it doesn't just
apply for me here at the studio it

476
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:26,680
apply for me here at the studio it
 

477
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,040
apply for me here at the studio it
applies for you at home if you've got

478
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,050
applies for you at home if you've got
 

479
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,230
applies for you at home if you've got
computers that maybe you're generating a

480
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,240
computers that maybe you're generating a
 

481
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,630
computers that maybe you're generating a
lot more noise then they need to be

482
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:33,640
lot more noise then they need to be
 

483
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,240
lot more noise then they need to be
maybe a solution is to look at those

484
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,250
maybe a solution is to look at those
 

485
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,670
maybe a solution is to look at those
fans and see if you can cut that down

486
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:38,680
fans and see if you can cut that down
 

487
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,340
fans and see if you can cut that down
look at the hard drives and say hey I've

488
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,350
look at the hard drives and say hey I've
 

489
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,900
look at the hard drives and say hey I've
got a lot of spinning hard drives in

490
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:42,910
got a lot of spinning hard drives in
 

491
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,420
got a lot of spinning hard drives in
there right now let's instead replace

492
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,430
there right now let's instead replace
 

493
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,060
there right now let's instead replace
those with some Kingston SSDs which are

494
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,070
those with some Kingston SSDs which are
 

495
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,490
those with some Kingston SSDs which are
they have no moving parts and they make

496
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:50,500
they have no moving parts and they make
 

497
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,580
they have no moving parts and they make
absolutely no noise they also

498
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:53,590
absolutely no noise they also
 

499
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,620
absolutely no noise they also
incidentally generate less heat which is

500
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:55,630
incidentally generate less heat which is
 

501
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,210
incidentally generate less heat which is
a nice bonus as well so this backup unit

502
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,220
a nice bonus as well so this backup unit
 

503
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,290
a nice bonus as well so this backup unit
is generating in my opinion way more

504
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,300
is generating in my opinion way more
 

505
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,620
is generating in my opinion way more
noise than I should be having from a

506
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:07,630
noise than I should be having from a
 

507
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,020
noise than I should be having from a
backup unit I mean it's it's my backup

508
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,030
backup unit I mean it's it's my backup
 

509
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,320
backup unit I mean it's it's my backup
it's incredibly important however it is

510
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,330
it's incredibly important however it is
 

511
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,060
it's incredibly important however it is
just my backup it's just two hard drives

512
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,070
just my backup it's just two hard drives
 

513
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,660
just my backup it's just two hard drives
spinning away generating that much heat

514
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:21,670
spinning away generating that much heat
 

515
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,840
spinning away generating that much heat
but it has to be running a fan at full

516
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:24,850
but it has to be running a fan at full
 

517
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,590
but it has to be running a fan at full
capacity speed all the time so the fan

518
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:28,600
capacity speed all the time so the fan
 

519
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,510
capacity speed all the time so the fan
that I got is a pretty popular one it's

520
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:30,520
that I got is a pretty popular one it's
 

521
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,380
that I got is a pretty popular one it's
an Arctic f8 silent so do keep in mind

522
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,390
an Arctic f8 silent so do keep in mind
 

523
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,650
an Arctic f8 silent so do keep in mind
it is the silent model and it says on

524
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:37,660
it is the silent model and it says on
 

525
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,280
it is the silent model and it says on
the Box extra quiet fan and you can see

526
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,290
the Box extra quiet fan and you can see
 

527
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,830
the Box extra quiet fan and you can see
on the back of this unit it does have a

528
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:43,840
on the back of this unit it does have a
 

529
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
on the back of this unit it does have a
fan to keep it everything cool so that's

530
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:45,850
fan to keep it everything cool so that's
 

531
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,810
fan to keep it everything cool so that's
what we're gonna be replacing I feel

532
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:48,820
what we're gonna be replacing I feel
 

533
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,120
what we're gonna be replacing I feel
like maybe the stock fan is louder than

534
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,130
like maybe the stock fan is louder than
 

535
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,199
like maybe the stock fan is louder than
it has to be

536
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:53,209
it has to be
 

537
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,329
it has to be
you guys could hear that you could see

538
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:55,339
you guys could hear that you could see
 

539
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,699
you guys could hear that you could see
that visually how much ambient noise

540
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:57,709
that visually how much ambient noise
 

541
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:05,889
that visually how much ambient noise
this thing was generating it's really

542
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:05,899
this thing was generating it's really
 

543
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:08,290
this thing was generating it's really
really easy to do this kind of it's not

544
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:08,300
really easy to do this kind of it's not
 

545
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,150
really easy to do this kind of it's not
even a repair it would be a repair if

546
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
even a repair it would be a repair if
 

547
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,150
even a repair it would be a repair if
the original fan wasn't wasn't working

548
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,160
the original fan wasn't wasn't working
 

549
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,650
the original fan wasn't wasn't working
in this case I'm replacing a working fan

550
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:16,660
in this case I'm replacing a working fan
 

551
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,919
in this case I'm replacing a working fan
but it's just a noisy fan alright so

552
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:20,929
but it's just a noisy fan alright so
 

553
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,739
but it's just a noisy fan alright so
what do we have here we've got some

554
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:23,749
what do we have here we've got some
 

555
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,869
what do we have here we've got some
we've got a tie wrap here that I'm gonna

556
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:25,879
we've got a tie wrap here that I'm gonna
 

557
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,249
we've got a tie wrap here that I'm gonna
have to cut I don't even have the

558
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:30,259
have to cut I don't even have the
 

559
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,090
have to cut I don't even have the
correct tools yet like scissors or wire

560
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,100
correct tools yet like scissors or wire
 

561
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,569
correct tools yet like scissors or wire
snips do not do this at home I'm gonna

562
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:37,579
snips do not do this at home I'm gonna
 

563
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:42,639
snips do not do this at home I'm gonna
be really careful you say that and then

564
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:42,649
be really careful you say that and then
 

565
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,530
be really careful you say that and then
I'm gonna cut my finger real bad I'm not

566
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:44,540
I'm gonna cut my finger real bad I'm not
 

567
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,650
I'm gonna cut my finger real bad I'm not
I'm not don't worry don't do this don't

568
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:50,660
I'm not don't worry don't do this don't
 

569
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,160
I'm not don't worry don't do this don't
ever do this I just I'm gonna get in so

570
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,170
ever do this I just I'm gonna get in so
 

571
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,359
ever do this I just I'm gonna get in so
much trouble for doing that

572
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:55,369
much trouble for doing that
 

573
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:59,319
much trouble for doing that
I know give me a hard time YouTube

574
00:13:59,319 --> 00:13:59,329
I know give me a hard time YouTube
 

575
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:04,720
I know give me a hard time YouTube
alright so there is the fan and this is

576
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:04,730
alright so there is the fan and this is
 

577
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,679
alright so there is the fan and this is
the molex connector for that fan ideally

578
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:08,689
the molex connector for that fan ideally
 

579
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,019
the molex connector for that fan ideally
if I could take this outside and blow it

580
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:11,029
if I could take this outside and blow it
 

581
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:15,309
if I could take this outside and blow it
out with with a camless air something

582
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:15,319
out with with a camless air something
 

583
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:16,660
out with with a camless air something
like that that would be ideal because

584
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:16,670
like that that would be ideal because
 

585
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,049
like that that would be ideal because
there's a lot of dust in there too

586
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:19,059
there's a lot of dust in there too
 

587
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:25,499
there's a lot of dust in there too
Wow alright so let's get into here so

588
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:25,509
Wow alright so let's get into here so
 

589
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:26,980
Wow alright so let's get into here so
simple folks

590
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:26,990
simple folks
 

591
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,949
simple folks
but the ultimate test is going to be I

592
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:29,959
but the ultimate test is going to be I
 

593
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,949
but the ultimate test is going to be I
want to know when we've got that

594
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
want to know when we've got that
 

595
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,660
want to know when we've got that
recorder recording so that we can

596
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:34,670
recorder recording so that we can
 

597
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,090
recorder recording so that we can
compare the actual ambient noise this is

598
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:37,100
compare the actual ambient noise this is
 

599
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,559
compare the actual ambient noise this is
generating when you get a fan you can

600
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:41,569
generating when you get a fan you can
 

601
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:44,289
generating when you get a fan you can
look at the fan and it will show you

602
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:44,299
look at the fan and it will show you
 

603
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,210
look at the fan and it will show you
because you wonder which which ways the

604
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,220
because you wonder which which ways the
 

605
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,220
because you wonder which which ways the
fan gonna be blowing and I would have

606
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,230
fan gonna be blowing and I would have
 

607
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,919
fan gonna be blowing and I would have
thought the fan was blowing out this way

608
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:49,929
thought the fan was blowing out this way
 

609
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:53,039
thought the fan was blowing out this way
but if you look really really closely

610
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,049
but if you look really really closely
 

611
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:56,289
but if you look really really closely
see if you can get a fix on that you

612
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:56,299
see if you can get a fix on that you
 

613
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:58,179
see if you can get a fix on that you
guys see that there's actually an arrow

614
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:58,189
guys see that there's actually an arrow
 

615
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,579
guys see that there's actually an arrow
which points the way that the fan is

616
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:00,589
which points the way that the fan is
 

617
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:03,069
which points the way that the fan is
going to be blowing so that's important

618
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:03,079
going to be blowing so that's important
 

619
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,619
going to be blowing so that's important
to note it's exactly the opposite of

620
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:05,629
to note it's exactly the opposite of
 

621
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:06,280
to note it's exactly the opposite of
what I would have thought

622
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,290
what I would have thought
 

623
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,570
what I would have thought
[Music]

624
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:07,580
[Music]
 

625
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,850
[Music]
so easy install and what I did is I just

626
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:13,860
so easy install and what I did is I just
 

627
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,600
so easy install and what I did is I just
I measured first and this is an eighty

628
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:17,610
I measured first and this is an eighty
 

629
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,040
I measured first and this is an eighty
millimeter so it was easy enough to find

630
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,050
millimeter so it was easy enough to find
 

631
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,030
millimeter so it was easy enough to find
online and as I say it was nine bucks to

632
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,040
online and as I say it was nine bucks to
 

633
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,050
online and as I say it was nine bucks to
get a hold of this fan so let's get that

634
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,060
get a hold of this fan so let's get that
 

635
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,139
get a hold of this fan so let's get that
in there just can use the same screws it

636
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:33,149
in there just can use the same screws it
 

637
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,940
in there just can use the same screws it
came with screws too but doesn't matter

638
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:34,950
came with screws too but doesn't matter
 

639
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:45,079
came with screws too but doesn't matter
they're the same so I'm hoping this is

640
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:45,089
they're the same so I'm hoping this is
 

641
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:47,090
they're the same so I'm hoping this is
gonna make enough of a difference here

642
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,100
gonna make enough of a difference here
 

643
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,030
gonna make enough of a difference here

because I knew that the a raid was using
 

677
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:59,199
because I knew that the a raid was using
molex and here we go

678
00:16:59,199 --> 00:16:59,209

 

679
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,939

come on these adapters can be a beast

680
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:01,949
come on these adapters can be a beast
 

681
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:06,590
come on these adapters can be a beast
they're not really just gonna line them

682
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:06,600
they're not really just gonna line them
 

683
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,399
they're not really just gonna line them
up right okay so let's put this on I'm

684
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,409
up right okay so let's put this on I'm
 

685
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,169
up right okay so let's put this on I'm
not gonna screw it all together just now

686
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:12,179
not gonna screw it all together just now
 

687
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,829
not gonna screw it all together just now
just for the sake of good TV because

688
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
just for the sake of good TV because
 

689
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,340
just for the sake of good TV because
that's not really all that exciting but

690
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,350
that's not really all that exciting but
 

691
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,260
that's not really all that exciting but
even without the screws we're gonna have

692
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,270
even without the screws we're gonna have
 

693
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,439
even without the screws we're gonna have
exactly the same ambient noise as with

694
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:24,449
exactly the same ambient noise as with
 

695
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:25,579
exactly the same ambient noise as with
the screws I don't think that's gonna

696
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:25,589
the screws I don't think that's gonna
 

697
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,460
the screws I don't think that's gonna
affect the accuracy whatsoever of our

698
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,470
affect the accuracy whatsoever of our
 

699
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,440
affect the accuracy whatsoever of our
test so I'm going to just put this back

700
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,450
test so I'm going to just put this back
 

701
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,560
test so I'm going to just put this back
on my server rack plug in the SATA cable

702
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:35,570
on my server rack plug in the SATA cable
 

703
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,510
on my server rack plug in the SATA cable
eSATA which just goes in the back here

704
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,520
eSATA which just goes in the back here
 

705
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,000
eSATA which just goes in the back here
if I can find it wasn't even in the

706
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,010
if I can find it wasn't even in the
 

707
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:53,450
if I can find it wasn't even in the
right place there we are and it's a full

708
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,460
right place there we are and it's a full
 

709
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,320
right place there we are and it's a full
size power cable it's like a computer

710
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,330
size power cable it's like a computer
 

711
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:02,000
size power cable it's like a computer
cable and if we're ready now this is

712
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,010
cable and if we're ready now this is
 

713
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,039
cable and if we're ready now this is
still recording and place it right at

714
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,049
still recording and place it right at
 

715
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:21,750
still recording and place it right at
the exact same spot and fire up

716
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760

 

717
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,110

what a difference oh my goodness I have

718
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
what a difference oh my goodness I have
 

719
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,220
what a difference oh my goodness I have
to actually make sure that this is

720
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,230
to actually make sure that this is
 

721
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,180
to actually make sure that this is
working and it is sure enough she's

722
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,190
working and it is sure enough she's
 

723
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:44,180
working and it is sure enough she's
blowing air

724
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,190

 

725
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,310

beautiful all right I am gonna fire back

726
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,320
beautiful all right I am gonna fire back
 

727
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,570
beautiful all right I am gonna fire back
up the server because the server

728
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:48,580
up the server because the server
 

729
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,540
up the server because the server
generated a lot of noise too and there's

730
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:51,550
generated a lot of noise too and there's
 

731
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,950
generated a lot of noise too and there's
not a lot I can do about that it's an

732
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
not a lot I can do about that it's an
 

733
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,140
not a lot I can do about that it's an
hour 5:10 they're pretty noisy servers

734
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,150
hour 5:10 they're pretty noisy servers
 

735
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,730
hour 5:10 they're pretty noisy servers
but let's fire it up just so that I can

736
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:56,740
but let's fire it up just so that I can
 

737
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,640
but let's fire it up just so that I can
compare the ambient noise difference you

738
00:18:59,640 --> 00:18:59,650
compare the ambient noise difference you
 

739
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,030
compare the ambient noise difference you
can hear that the backup Drive alone

740
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,040
can hear that the backup Drive alone
 

741
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,330
can hear that the backup Drive alone
huge difference now let's fire back up

742
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:06,340
huge difference now let's fire back up
 

743
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,590
huge difference now let's fire back up
the server this can get loud for a

744
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
the server this can get loud for a
 

745
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:16,610
the server this can get loud for a
second because they fire up loud

746
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:16,620

749
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,800

still notably quieter but let's wait for

still notably quieter but let's wait for
 

751
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,410
still notably quieter but let's wait for
it because these servers will those fans

752
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:28,420
it because these servers will those fans
 

753
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,450
it because these servers will those fans
are gonna calm down in a moment they

754
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:30,460
are gonna calm down in a moment they
 

755
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,510
are gonna calm down in a moment they
blow out the dust and everything before

756
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:32,520
blow out the dust and everything before
 

757
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,410
blow out the dust and everything before
as they're just first booting up once

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:37,420
as they're just first booting up once
 

759
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,090
as they're just first booting up once
the drives start flashing that means

760
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,100
the drives start flashing that means
 

761
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:46,680
the drives start flashing that means
it's booting

762
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:46,690

 

763
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,600

it's still pretty loud but it's nowhere

764
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:48,610
it's still pretty loud but it's nowhere
 

765
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,420
it's still pretty loud but it's nowhere
near and here you can hear whining them

766
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,430
near and here you can hear whining them
 

767
00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:12,029
near and here you can hear whining them
I can't at least

768
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:12,039

 

769
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,239

and there she goes starting the boot up

770
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:15,249
and there she goes starting the boot up
 

771
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:18,769

so once it's finished booting we'll have

774
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
so once it's finished booting we'll have
 

775
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,090
so once it's finished booting we'll have
a pretty good impression as to the

776
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,100
a pretty good impression as to the
 

777
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,120
a pretty good impression as to the
difference that this is made for nine

778
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,130
difference that this is made for nine
 

779
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,720
difference that this is made for nine
bucks I can also be doing the same thing

780
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:30,730
bucks I can also be doing the same thing
 

781
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,690
bucks I can also be doing the same thing
you remember that my laptop computer had

782
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:33,700
you remember that my laptop computer had
 

783
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,760
you remember that my laptop computer had
a really noisy fan my ThinkPad and so

784
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:38,770
a really noisy fan my ThinkPad and so
 

785
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,640
a really noisy fan my ThinkPad and so
I've also ordered a replacement fan for

786
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,650
I've also ordered a replacement fan for
 

787
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,039
I've also ordered a replacement fan for
that which has arrived I haven't gotten

788
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:44,049
that which has arrived I haven't gotten
 

789
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,480
that which has arrived I haven't gotten
into that but while we're waiting for

790
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,490
into that but while we're waiting for
 

791
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,789
into that but while we're waiting for
that to boot so like this is a really

792
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:47,799
that to boot so like this is a really
 

793
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,680
that to boot so like this is a really
simple fix that you can just do for a

794
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:49,690
simple fix that you can just do for a
 

795
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,539
simple fix that you can just do for a
lot of your devices I mean who would

796
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:51,549
lot of your devices I mean who would
 

797
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,149
lot of your devices I mean who would
have thought your backup drive even

798
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:53,159
have thought your backup drive even
 

799
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,010
have thought your backup drive even
let's get into this box though let's see

800
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,020
let's get into this box though let's see
 

801
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:07,399
let's get into this box though let's see
what they've sent me yeah there we are

802
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:07,409

 

803
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,500

there it is so that's the cooling system

804
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,510
there it is so that's the cooling system
 

805
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,610
there it is so that's the cooling system
for my laptop and that's gonna make that

806
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:14,620
for my laptop and that's gonna make that
 

807
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,250
for my laptop and that's gonna make that
same amount of difference for for my

808
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:17,260
same amount of difference for for my
 

809
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,380
same amount of difference for for my
laptop computer so you can get these

810
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,390
laptop computer so you can get these
 

811
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,510
laptop computer so you can get these
kind of replacement parts and you don't

812
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
kind of replacement parts and you don't
 

813
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,430
kind of replacement parts and you don't
have to replace a whole laptop or a

814
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
have to replace a whole laptop or a
 

815
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,159
have to replace a whole laptop or a
whole backup drive to reduce the ambient

816
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:26,169
whole backup drive to reduce the ambient
 

817
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,560
whole backup drive to reduce the ambient
noise so now I'm gonna switch back to

818
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:28,570
noise so now I'm gonna switch back to
 

819
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,330
noise so now I'm gonna switch back to
this microphone so that we can hear with

820
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:30,340
this microphone so that we can hear with
 

821
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,760
this microphone so that we can hear with
the server running the backup drive

822
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:32,770
the server running the backup drive
 

823
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,180
the server running the backup drive
running how does this compare to when I

824
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,190
running how does this compare to when I
 

825
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,269
running how does this compare to when I
first started this segment and still

826
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:39,279
first started this segment and still
 

827
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,980
first started this segment and still
booting it's doing a lot of reading so

828
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:40,990
booting it's doing a lot of reading so
 

829
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,510
booting it's doing a lot of reading so
it might be a little bit inaccurate

830
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,520
it might be a little bit inaccurate
 

831
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,909
it might be a little bit inaccurate
let's there you can hear that it's

832
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:44,919
let's there you can hear that it's
 

833
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:45,690
let's there you can hear that it's
slowing down

834
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:45,700
slowing down
 

835
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,149
slowing down
let's give it just another split second

836
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
let's give it just another split second
 

837
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,700
let's give it just another split second
here you can see the drives are going

838
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:50,710
here you can see the drives are going
 

839
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,529
here you can see the drives are going
crazy so that means it's still in the

840
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:52,539
crazy so that means it's still in the
 

841
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:58,230
crazy so that means it's still in the
boot process

842
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,240

 

843
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,320

what a difference there I'm gonna in

844
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,330
what a difference there I'm gonna in
 

845
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,850
what a difference there I'm gonna in
post-production I'm gonna just go back

846
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:02,860
post-production I'm gonna just go back
 

847
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,630
post-production I'm gonna just go back
over so this is the array Drive by

848
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
over so this is the array Drive by
 

849
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,780
over so this is the array Drive by
itself just the backup servers off all

850
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:09,790
itself just the backup servers off all
 

851
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,400
itself just the backup servers off all
by itself before I replace the fan and

852
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,410
by itself before I replace the fan and
 

853
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,580
by itself before I replace the fan and
here it is after I replace the fan and

854
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:19,590
here it is after I replace the fan and
 

855
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,080
here it is after I replace the fan and
here they are side by side those wave

856
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,090
here they are side by side those wave
 

857
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,540
here they are side by side those wave
tables just so you can see the the

858
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:24,550
tables just so you can see the the
 

859
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:30,000
tables just so you can see the the
difference in the ambient noise alright

860
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,010
difference in the ambient noise alright
 

861
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,730
difference in the ambient noise alright
so that server still booting still going

862
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:32,740
so that server still booting still going
 

863
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,100
so that server still booting still going
through its thing but let's let's get a

864
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,110
through its thing but let's let's get a
 

865
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,220
through its thing but let's let's get a
look at how the ambient noise altogether

866
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,230
look at how the ambient noise altogether
 

867
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,780
look at how the ambient noise altogether
now so the server and the backup driver

868
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:39,790
now so the server and the backup driver
 

869
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,190
now so the server and the backup driver
back up and running just like they were

870
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
back up and running just like they were
 

871
00:22:41,200 --> 00:23:05,800
back up and running just like they were
before how is that affected

872
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:05,810

 

873
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,270

so the verdict for 9 bucks for 9 bucks

874
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,280
so the verdict for 9 bucks for 9 bucks
 

875
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,030
so the verdict for 9 bucks for 9 bucks
we brought down the ambient noise quite

876
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,040
we brought down the ambient noise quite
 

877
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,970
we brought down the ambient noise quite
noticeably here in the production studio

878
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:15,980
noticeably here in the production studio
 

879
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,770
noticeably here in the production studio
it's something I mean we all have

880
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:17,780
it's something I mean we all have
 

881
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,540
it's something I mean we all have
computers sitting next to us and

882
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:19,550
computers sitting next to us and
 

883
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,340
computers sitting next to us and
sometimes they're louder than they need

884
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,350
sometimes they're louder than they need
 

885
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,480
sometimes they're louder than they need
to be and sometimes we don't even

886
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,490
to be and sometimes we don't even
 

887
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,220
to be and sometimes we don't even
realize it but listen to your computer

888
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,230
realize it but listen to your computer
 

889
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,310
realize it but listen to your computer
and just see hey could this be a little

890
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,320
and just see hey could this be a little
 

891
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,710
and just see hey could this be a little
bit quieter and maybe replacing the CPU

892
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:29,720
bit quieter and maybe replacing the CPU
 

893
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,780
bit quieter and maybe replacing the CPU
fan or as I say switching out from a

894
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:31,790
fan or as I say switching out from a
 

895
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,540
fan or as I say switching out from a
spinning hard drive to an SSD from

896
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:34,550
spinning hard drive to an SSD from
 

897
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,940
spinning hard drive to an SSD from
Kingston technology something like that

898
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:36,950
Kingston technology something like that
 

899
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,560
Kingston technology something like that
would make a huge difference to the

900
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,570
would make a huge difference to the
 

901
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,630
would make a huge difference to the
ambient noise in the room and it just

902
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
ambient noise in the room and it just
 

903
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,010
ambient noise in the room and it just
makes things so much better for

904
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,020
makes things so much better for
 

905
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,530
makes things so much better for
broadcast it's gonna be a lot better now

906
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:44,540
broadcast it's gonna be a lot better now
 

907
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,070
broadcast it's gonna be a lot better now
that's a noticeable difference it's not

908
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
that's a noticeable difference it's not
 

909
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,510
that's a noticeable difference it's not
perfect they're still you can still hear

910
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
perfect they're still you can still hear
 

911
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,210
perfect they're still you can still hear
the server but the backup drive is no

912
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,220
the server but the backup drive is no
 

913
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,810
the server but the backup drive is no
longer creating the unbelievable amounts

914
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:55,820
longer creating the unbelievable amounts
 

915
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,300
longer creating the unbelievable amounts
of noise that it that it was well there

916
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,310
of noise that it that it was well there
 

917
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,340
of noise that it that it was well there
you have it you can look up your

to replace and we did it here we're

938
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,270
to replace and we did it here we're

now the having occurs every two hundred

1156

now the having occurs every two hundred

by around fifty percent currently that

by around fifty percent currently that
is twelve and a half percent every ten

is twelve and a half percent every ten
 

1167
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,350
is twelve and a half percent every ten
minutes and it will be reduced to six

1168
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360

1175
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,290
clock in the upper time is based on the
current block time so it takes around

1176
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:25,300
current block time so it takes around
 

1177
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,660
current block time so it takes around
eight point eight minutes not 10 minutes

Bitcoin that the system emits every
around 10 minutes or currently every

1190
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
around 10 minutes or currently every
 

1191
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,260
around 10 minutes or currently every
eight and a half minutes so you have to

1192
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,270
eight and a half minutes so you have to
 

1193
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,630
eight and a half minutes so you have to
watch the upper time because that is the

1194
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:45,640
watch the upper time because that is the
 

1195
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
watch the upper time because that is the
one that counts there is no time within

1196
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:49,180
one that counts there is no time within
 

1197
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,450
one that counts there is no time within
the Bitcoin blockchain it's just block

1198
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:51,460
the Bitcoin blockchain it's just block
 

1199
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,750
the Bitcoin blockchain it's just block
and every look I said it takes around 10

1200
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:54,760
and every look I said it takes around 10
 

1201
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,320
and every look I said it takes around 10
minutes to be mined and so there's this

1202
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,330
minutes to be mined and so there's this
 

1203
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,030
minutes to be mined and so there's this
time difference coming from now how do

1204

have got old machines are not operating
 

1255
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,790
have got old machines are not operating
economically anymore we'll just switch

1256
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:19,800
economically anymore we'll just switch
 

1257
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,260
economically anymore we'll just switch
off their machines or we'll move to

1258
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,270
off their machines or we'll move to
 

1259
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,330
off their machines or we'll move to
another network the plenty of other

networks that accept all that that can
 

1263
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,760
networks that accept all that that can
work with ASIC machines so only the best

1264
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:28,770
work with ASIC machines so only the best
 

1265
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,830
work with ASIC machines so only the best
machines will continue working on the

2013 when somebody came up with the ASIC

1272
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:38,610
2013 when somebody came up with the ASIC
 

1273
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,490
2013 when somebody came up with the ASIC
for the first time all those GPS miners

1274
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:42,500
for the first time all those GPS miners
 

1275
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,100
for the first time all those GPS miners
GPU - sorry the GPO - were obsolete and

1276
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,110
GPU - sorry the GPO - were obsolete and
 

1277
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,200
GPU - sorry the GPO - were obsolete and
could be switched off because none of

1278
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,210
could be switched off because none of
 

1279
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,060
could be switched off because none of
them were really mining any bitcoins

1280
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,070
them were really mining any bitcoins
 

1281
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,190
them were really mining any bitcoins
anymore so life will continue and also

1282
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
anymore so life will continue and also
 

1283
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,530
anymore so life will continue and also
if let's say a substantial amount of

if let's say a substantial amount of
 

1285
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,050
if let's say a substantial amount of
Bitcoin or switch of the machines then

1286
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,060
Bitcoin or switch of the machines then
 

1287
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,240
Bitcoin or switch of the machines then
as it's currently happening with the

as it's currently happening with the
 

1289
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,400
as it's currently happening with the
time the time will be inverted so it

1290
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,410
time the time will be inverted so it
 

1291
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,050
time the time will be inverted so it
will take longer than 10 minutes to mine

1292
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,060
will take longer than 10 minutes to mine
 

1293
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,510
will take longer than 10 minutes to mine
a Bitcoin and to mine a block and and

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:11,520
a Bitcoin and to mine a block and and
 

1295
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,340
a Bitcoin and to mine a block and and
after 2016 blocks the difficulty will be

00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,350
after 2016 blocks the difficulty will be
 

1297
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,320
after 2016 blocks the difficulty will be
just it anyway and it will be back to

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,330
just it anyway and it will be back to
 

1299
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,700
just it anyway and it will be back to
the user of 10 minutes so there's

1300
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:19,710
the user of 10 minutes so there's
 

1301
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,900
the user of 10 minutes so there's
nothing to worry about this is a natural

effect that tabs on the blockchain on
 

1305
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,030
effect that tabs on the blockchain on
the Bitcoin blockchain and it's not the

the Bitcoin blockchain and it's not the
 

1307
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,470
the Bitcoin blockchain and it's not the
first time it's the third time that this

really interesting one it's called t7
 

1327
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,250
really interesting one it's called t7
and it's translated into digital

1328
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:52,260
and it's translated into digital
 

1329
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,160
and it's translated into digital
currency electronic payment and that is

00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,170
currency electronic payment and that is
 

1331
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,010

so that happened now as we had

1334
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,330
so that happened now as we had
 

1335
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,000
so that happened now as we had

December last year they have done it now

1338
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:04,440
December last year they have done it now
 

1339
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,770
December last year they have done it now
they're rolling it out and

1340
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:06,780
they're rolling it out and
 

1341
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,050
they're rolling it out and
would have I'm pretty sure global

1342
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,060
would have I'm pretty sure global
 

1343
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,830
would have I'm pretty sure global
implications so they're gradually

1344
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:12,840
implications so they're gradually
 

1345
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,110
implications so they're gradually
replacing the paper money with the

replacing the paper money with the
 

1347
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,490
replacing the paper money with the
blockchain money and as you probably

1348
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:16,500
blockchain money and as you probably
 

1349
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,830
blockchain money and as you probably
know from China if you go to a small

1350
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:18,840
know from China if you go to a small
 

1351

very cheap you don't buy it with cash
anymore you pay there with your cell

1356
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:26,910
anymore you pay there with your cell
 

1357
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,780
anymore you pay there with your cell
phone a little bit like Apple pay they

have got their systems and everybody has
 

1361
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,250
have got their systems and everybody has
got that over there then sometimes they

1362
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,260
got that over there then sometimes they
 

1363
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,780
got that over there then sometimes they
don't even accept credit cards anymore

1364

don't even accept credit cards anymore
 

1365
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,060
don't even accept credit cards anymore
and in future it will be only this

1369
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,610
famous D SEP and you'll see two charts
in a second behind me when it's a

1370
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:43,620
in a second behind me when it's a
 

1371
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,260
in a second behind me when it's a

and the other one is just a comparison
 

1375
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,900
and the other one is just a comparison
to cash and and other valuables now

rolling it out and testing it they will
 

1383
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,770
rolling it out and testing it they will
be involving huge vendors like

the stage every merchant must accept the
 

1391
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,940
the stage every merchant must accept the
D SEP because it's the official currency
