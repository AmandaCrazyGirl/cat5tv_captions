support the Gigabit Ethernet so that and
 

161
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,840
support the Gigabit Ethernet so that and
the gigabit internet so that I'm not

162
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:58,850
the gigabit internet so that I'm not
 

163
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,640
the gigabit internet so that I'm not
losing some of the speed of my internet

164
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:01,650
losing some of the speed of my internet
 

165
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,470
losing some of the speed of my internet
connectivity that's very very important

166
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
connectivity that's very very important
 

167
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,800
connectivity that's very very important
second to that is the fact that it has a

168
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:06,810
second to that is the fact that it has a
 

169
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,430
second to that is the fact that it has a
dual radio so 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi

170
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:10,440
dual radio so 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi
 

171
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,760
dual radio so 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi
so I can put my cameras on 2.4 gigahertz

172
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:13,770
so I can put my cameras on 2.4 gigahertz
 

173
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,729
so I can put my cameras on 2.4 gigahertz
which is a pretty oversaturated band but

174
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:16,739
which is a pretty oversaturated band but
 

175
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,349
which is a pretty oversaturated band but
at the same time I can have 5 gigahertz

176
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:18,359
at the same time I can have 5 gigahertz
 

177
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,539
at the same time I can have 5 gigahertz
for my phone and my other devices so

178
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:20,549
for my phone and my other devices so
 

179
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,130
for my phone and my other devices so
that I've got better speed better

180
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,140
that I've got better speed better
 

181
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,470

capabilities of the programming are
 

261
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,330
capabilities of the programming are
completely the same so the only

262
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,340
completely the same so the only
 

263
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,610
completely the same so the only
limitation is based on hardware so you

264
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:10,620
limitation is based on hardware so you
 

265
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,560
limitation is based on hardware so you
can start off with something really

266
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,570
can start off with something really
 

267
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,840
can start off with something really
cheap and work your way up later you can

268
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,850
cheap and work your way up later you can
 

269
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,270
cheap and work your way up later you can
upgrade if you need something better

270
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,280
upgrade if you need something better
 

271
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,900
upgrade if you need something better
that's pretty cool

272
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:17,910
that's pretty cool
 

273
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,710
that's pretty cool
so again cat5 dot TV slash mikrotik the

274
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,720
so again cat5 dot TV slash mikrotik the
 

275
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,020
so again cat5 dot TV slash mikrotik the
now all all that I've done is plugged in

276
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,030
now all all that I've done is plugged in
 

277
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,180
now all all that I've done is plugged in
the power so far but what we need to do

278
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,190
the power so far but what we need to do
 

279
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,420
the power so far but what we need to do
first and foremost is I need to bridge

280
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,430
first and foremost is I need to bridge
 

281
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,510
first and foremost is I need to bridge
my internet modem so my internet service

282
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,520
my internet modem so my internet service
 

283
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,840
my internet modem so my internet service
provider has provided an internet modem

284
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:35,850
provider has provided an internet modem
 

285
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,550
provider has provided an internet modem
that allows me connectivity but that

286
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,560
that allows me connectivity but that
 

287
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,770
that allows me connectivity but that
modem has a DHCP server it has a

288
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:39,780
modem has a DHCP server it has a
 

289
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,010
modem has a DHCP server it has a
firewall and it's basically allowing my

290
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,020
firewall and it's basically allowing my
 

291
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,560
firewall and it's basically allowing my
computers to communicate to the Internet

292
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:45,570
computers to communicate to the Internet
 

293
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,020
computers to communicate to the Internet
well I'm going to replace that built-in

294
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,030
well I'm going to replace that built-in
 

295
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,150
well I'm going to replace that built-in
firewall and that built-in router with

296
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
firewall and that built-in router with
 

297
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,240
firewall and that built-in router with
and the DHCP server with my mikrotik so

298
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,250
and the DHCP server with my mikrotik so
 

299
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,659
and the DHCP server with my mikrotik so
I need to do what's called a bridge so

300
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:56,669
I need to do what's called a bridge so
 

301
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:00,860
I need to do what's called a bridge so
the modem that my ISP provides mine is a

302
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:00,870
the modem that my ISP provides mine is a
 

303
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,790
the modem that my ISP provides mine is a
hITRON modem I need to set it so that it

304
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
hITRON modem I need to set it so that it
 

305
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,850
hITRON modem I need to set it so that it
is nothing but a modem and then we're

306
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:07,860
is nothing but a modem and then we're
 

307
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,590
is nothing but a modem and then we're
going to use this device to control it

308
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:09,600
going to use this device to control it
 

309
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,050
going to use this device to control it
so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm

310
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,060
so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm
 

311
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,850
so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm
gonna log into the interface and the

312
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:16,860
gonna log into the interface and the
 

313
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,580
gonna log into the interface and the
hITRON modems rcus admin is the log in

314
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:19,590
hITRON modems rcus admin is the log in
 

315
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,700
hITRON modems rcus admin is the log in
your modem is going to be different so

316
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,710
your modem is going to be different so
 

317
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,120
your modem is going to be different so
do keep that in mind it's gonna be the

318
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,130
do keep that in mind it's gonna be the
 

319
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,940
do keep that in mind it's gonna be the
IP address of your gateway you can find

320
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:28,950
IP address of your gateway you can find
 

321
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,150
IP address of your gateway you can find
out more by contacting your ISP if

322
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
out more by contacting your ISP if
 

323
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,490
out more by contacting your ISP if
you're not sure how to do that but just

324
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:34,500
you're not sure how to do that but just
 

325
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,640
you're not sure how to do that but just
ask them hey how do I bridge my modem

326
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:37,650
ask them hey how do I bridge my modem
 

327
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,130
ask them hey how do I bridge my modem
that's the important thing so it is just

328
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,140
that's the important thing so it is just
 

329
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,080
that's the important thing so it is just
gonna be a dumb modem that gives my

330
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,090
gonna be a dumb modem that gives my
 

331
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,690
gonna be a dumb modem that gives my
mikrotik access to the Internet

332
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:44,700
mikrotik access to the Internet
 

333
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,460
mikrotik access to the Internet
so on the hITRON I'm going to go into

334
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,470
so on the hITRON I'm going to go into
 

335
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,030
so on the hITRON I'm going to go into
basic and then gateway function and

336
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,040
basic and then gateway function and
 

337
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,160
basic and then gateway function and
residential gateway function is enabled

338
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,170
residential gateway function is enabled
 

339
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,060
residential gateway function is enabled
by default

340
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,070
by default
 

341
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,640
by default
I want to simply disable that now keep

342
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,650
I want to simply disable that now keep
 

343
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,430
I want to simply disable that now keep
in mind as soon as I say okay I'm gonna

344
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,440
in mind as soon as I say okay I'm gonna
 

345
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,470
in mind as soon as I say okay I'm gonna
lose access to the Internet once I hit

346
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:00,480
lose access to the Internet once I hit
 

347
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,780
lose access to the Internet once I hit
Save Changes so let's do it

348
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:02,790
Save Changes so let's do it
 

349
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,870
Save Changes so let's do it
because now I have turned that into a

350
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:05,880
because now I have turned that into a
 

351
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,130
because now I have turned that into a
dumb modem so let's grab an Ethernet

352
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,140
dumb modem so let's grab an Ethernet
 

353
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,520
dumb modem so let's grab an Ethernet
cable and let's let's uplink our router

354
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,530
cable and let's let's uplink our router
 

355
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,130
cable and let's let's uplink our router
board so the router board port number

356
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,140
board so the router board port number
 

357
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,870
board so the router board port number
one I'm going to set as my LAN port so

358
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:20,880
one I'm going to set as my LAN port so
 

359
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,430
one I'm going to set as my LAN port so
I'm going to connect that into my

360
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm going to connect that into my
 

361
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm going to connect that into my
network just get this out of the way

362
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,050
network just get this out of the way
 

363
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,890
network just get this out of the way
this is a little bit rickety because I'm

364
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:27,900
this is a little bit rickety because I'm
 

365
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,050
this is a little bit rickety because I'm
doing this you know pretty makeshift but

366
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,060
doing this you know pretty makeshift but
 

367
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,600
doing this you know pretty makeshift but
you're gonna get the idea basically port

368
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:35,610
you're gonna get the idea basically port
 

369
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,370
you're gonna get the idea basically port
number one from the router board is

370
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:37,380
number one from the router board is
 

371
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,710
number one from the router board is
going to come out to my my modem so I'm

372
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:42,720
going to come out to my my modem so I'm
 

373
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,820
going to come out to my my modem so I'm
gonna plug that in to my modem here

374
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:48,830
gonna plug that in to my modem here
 

375
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:56,320
gonna plug that in to my modem here
there we go connected and good let's see

376
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,330
there we go connected and good let's see
 

377
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,000
there we go connected and good let's see
yeah doesn't seem to matter which port I

378
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,010
yeah doesn't seem to matter which port I
 

379
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,090
yeah doesn't seem to matter which port I
go in I'm gonna just jam that in there

380
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,100
go in I'm gonna just jam that in there
 

381
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,080
go in I'm gonna just jam that in there
there we go

382
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,090
there we go
 

383
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,930
there we go
and now I'm gonna take the cable that

384
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:05,940
and now I'm gonna take the cable that
 

385
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,540
and now I'm gonna take the cable that
was up linking me to the network and I'm

386
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:08,550
was up linking me to the network and I'm
 

387
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,090
was up linking me to the network and I'm
gonna plug this into port number two on

388
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,100
gonna plug this into port number two on
 

389
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,740
gonna plug this into port number two on
my router board and that's going to give

390
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:12,750
my router board and that's going to give
 

391
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,860
my router board and that's going to give
me access to the micro tech I say router

392
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:15,870
me access to the micro tech I say router
 

393
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,990
me access to the micro tech I say router
board mikrotik as the brand router board

394
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
board mikrotik as the brand router board
 

395
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,220
board mikrotik as the brand router board
is the product so my network which is my

396
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,230
is the product so my network which is my
 

397
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,490
is the product so my network which is my
switch is now connected to port number

398
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:25,500
switch is now connected to port number
 

399
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,770
switch is now connected to port number
two so my computer is basically seeing

400
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:27,780
two so my computer is basically seeing
 

401
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,480
two so my computer is basically seeing
port number two port number one on the

402
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,490
port number two port number one on the
 

403
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,380
port number two port number one on the
mikrotik is going into the back of the

404
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,390
mikrotik is going into the back of the
 

405
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,950
mikrotik is going into the back of the
actual ISP modem which is now set to

406
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:36,960
actual ISP modem which is now set to
 

407
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,310
actual ISP modem which is now set to
bridged mode so let's jump over to our

408
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
bridged mode so let's jump over to our
 

409
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,340
bridged mode so let's jump over to our
mikrotik first of all we need to see

410
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,350
mikrotik first of all we need to see
 

411
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,810
mikrotik first of all we need to see
what's now one thing you're gonna notice

412
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
what's now one thing you're gonna notice
 

413
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,970
what's now one thing you're gonna notice
is that I am at 10.00 dot

414
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:48,980
is that I am at 10.00 dot
 

415
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,040
is that I am at 10.00 dot
to find out what my new network is now

416
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,050
to find out what my new network is now
 

417
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,820
to find out what my new network is now
that I am on the micro tech ipconfig

418
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:54,830
that I am on the micro tech ipconfig
 

419
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,400
that I am on the micro tech ipconfig
/all so this is

420
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,410
/all so this is
 

421
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,519
/all so this is
in Windows in Linux you're gonna type IP

422
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:00,529
in Windows in Linux you're gonna type IP
 

423
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,089
in Windows in Linux you're gonna type IP
space - a and let's find out what kind

424
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:04,099
space - a and let's find out what kind
 

425
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:07,059
space - a and let's find out what kind
of networking I've got here okay I'm

426
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:07,069
of networking I've got here okay I'm
 

427
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,409
of networking I've got here okay I'm
still seeing a default gateway of

428
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:08,419
still seeing a default gateway of
 

429
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:15,569
still seeing a default gateway of
10.0.0.0 it has not refreshed yet so

430
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:15,579
10.0.0.0 it has not refreshed yet so
 

431
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,749
10.0.0.0 it has not refreshed yet so
let's check so I'm on Windows 10 and

432
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:19,759
let's check so I'm on Windows 10 and
 

433
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,919
let's check so I'm on Windows 10 and
even though a reboot could trigger

434
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:22,929
even though a reboot could trigger
 

435
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,960
even though a reboot could trigger
basically fixing your network by trying

436
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:25,970
basically fixing your network by trying
 

437
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,549
basically fixing your network by trying
to reconnect all I'm gonna do is I'm

438
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:27,559
to reconnect all I'm gonna do is I'm
 

439
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,229
to reconnect all I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna right click on my 8th ernet

440
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:29,239
gonna right click on my 8th ernet
 

441
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:33,009
gonna right click on my 8th ernet
adapter and disconnect disable the

442
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:33,019
adapter and disconnect disable the
 

443
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,049
adapter and disconnect disable the
Ethernet adapter and re-enable it and

444
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:35,059
Ethernet adapter and re-enable it and
 

445
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:38,919
Ethernet adapter and re-enable it and
now once it reconnects I should be able

446
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:38,929
now once it reconnects I should be able
 

447
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,409
now once it reconnects I should be able
to do an IP config slash all and should

448
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:41,419
to do an IP config slash all and should
 

449
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:49,389
to do an IP config slash all and should
see yes ok so we now are on 192.168.1 so

450
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:49,399
see yes ok so we now are on 192.168.1 so
 

451
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,449
see yes ok so we now are on 192.168.1 so
let's try that 192.168.1 and there we

452
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:55,459
let's try that 192.168.1 and there we
 

453
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,279
let's try that 192.168.1 and there we
are with router OS so in retro ass first

454
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,289
are with router OS so in retro ass first
 

455
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,899
are with router OS so in retro ass first
thing we with now this is the quick set

456
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:01,909
thing we with now this is the quick set
 

457
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,599
thing we with now this is the quick set
so this is allowing us to quickly set up

458
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:04,609
so this is allowing us to quickly set up
 

459
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:07,659
so this is allowing us to quickly set up
our mikrotik router device so let's see

460
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:07,669
our mikrotik router device so let's see
 

461
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,369
our mikrotik router device so let's see
what's happening here so DHCP server

462
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:09,379
what's happening here so DHCP server
 

463
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:13,689
what's happening here so DHCP server
range I want to change that to 10 dot 0

464
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:13,699
range I want to change that to 10 dot 0
 

465
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:20,229
range I want to change that to 10 dot 0

10.0.0.0 block so that is general

474
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,069
10.0.0.0 block so that is general

but essentially that's my IP block if
 

481
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:45,129
but essentially that's my IP block if
you're happy with 192.168.1 that's fine

gonna do that
in a little bit so let's just get our IP

496
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,210
in a little bit so let's just get our IP
 

497
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,390
in a little bit so let's just get our IP

automatically get the IP address so
 

509
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,690
automatically get the IP address so
let's see what happens here as as I

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:28,890
apply that configuration so we should
 

513
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,010
apply that configuration so we should
see that that router is going to restart

514
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,020
see that that router is going to restart
 

515
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,000
see that that router is going to restart
itself and when it does we're going to

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,010
itself and when it does we're going to
 

517

548
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,060

 

549
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,069

let's see how she's doing

550
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:55,079

 

551
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:04,290

go-go-go so that was a pretty miserable

552
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,300
go-go-go so that was a pretty miserable
 

553
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,759
go-go-go so that was a pretty miserable
download speed upload speed not terrible

554
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:10,769
download speed upload speed not terrible
 

555
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:18,900
download speed upload speed not terrible
test again something's up there maybe

556
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:18,910
test again something's up there maybe
 

557
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,129
test again something's up there maybe
we're just in that you know that

558
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:22,139
we're just in that you know that

we're just in that you know that
pandemic internet speed everything is

560
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,690
pandemic internet speed everything is
 

561
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,500
pandemic internet speed everything is
pretty slow right now yeah getting

562
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:28,510
pretty slow right now yeah getting
 

563
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,160
pretty slow right now yeah getting
pretty low speeds so even still a 10

564
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,170
pretty low speeds so even still a 10
 

565
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,350
pretty low speeds so even still a 10
over 100 router would only give me up to

566
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,360
over 100 router would only give me up to
 

567
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,100
over 100 router would only give me up to
100 megabits and I'm pushing 156 right

568
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,110
100 megabits and I'm pushing 156 right
 

569
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,860
100 megabits and I'm pushing 156 right
now that's pretty bad considering I'm

570
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:40,870
now that's pretty bad considering I'm
 

571
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,230

573
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,629
supposed to have a gig but at least I
know that I'm getting better than 100

574
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:45,639
know that I'm getting better than 100
 

575
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,810
know that I'm getting better than 100
megabits a second so there we go

576
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:47,820
megabits a second so there we go
 

577
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,639
megabits a second so there we go
everything looks pretty well set let's

578

00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:53,949
jump into web Figg now this is what
 

581
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:57,960
jump into web Figg now this is what
makes the mikrotik so very powerful this

582

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,689
makes the mikrotik so very powerful this
is the software which you will get lost

584
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:00,699
is the software which you will get lost

if you try to find your way through here
and note that that's as quick as it was

588
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:05,589
and note that that's as quick as it was
 

589
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,259
and note that that's as quick as it was
to get everything up and running but I

590
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:07,269
to get everything up and running but I
 

591
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,910
to get everything up and running but I
am going to need to set up things like

592
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:08,920
am going to need to set up things like
 

593
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:17,040
am going to need to set up things like
under IP I can set up DHCP reservations

594
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,050
under IP I can set up DHCP reservations
 

595
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,129
under IP I can set up DHCP reservations
so as my devices connect I can actually

596
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:20,139
so as my devices connect I can actually
 

597
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:23,970
so as my devices connect I can actually
set these up as static devices you'll

598
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:23,980
set these up as static devices you'll
 

599
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,439
set these up as static devices you'll
notice it's counting backwards so my

600
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,449
notice it's counting backwards so my
 

601
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,199
notice it's counting backwards so my

actually starting at the high end of the
 

605
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,370
actually starting at the high end of the
DHCP pool and working its way down which

DHCP pool and working its way down which
 

607
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,250

so Wi-Fi is pretty straightforward i'm
going to add a Wi-Fi password of

630
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,390
going to add a Wi-Fi password of
 

631

okay so network name on 2 gigahertz I

638
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,210
okay so network name on 2 gigahertz I
 

639
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,750
okay so network name on 2 gigahertz I
can leave it as is or I can say cat 5 TV

645
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,840
I can have a point in there or not I'll
go cat 5 TV and then for 5 gigahertz

646
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:27,850
go cat 5 TV and then for 5 gigahertz
 

647
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:35,460
go cat 5 TV and then for 5 gigahertz
I'll go cat 5 TV 5 gigahertz yeah all

having to reboot my router every time
 

665
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,569
having to reboot my router every time
and notice I'm starting to pick up some

666
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:06,579
and notice I'm starting to pick up some
 

667
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,960
and notice I'm starting to pick up some
Wi-Fi connectivity here I don't have to

668

Wi-Fi connectivity here I don't have to
 

669
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,430
Wi-Fi connectivity here I don't have to
reboot every time I change the

670
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:14,440
reboot every time I change the
 

671
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,060
reboot every time I change the
configuration and when I create any kind

672
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,070
configuration and when I create any kind
 

673
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,230
configuration and when I create any kind
of config it's instantaneous so but what

674
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
of config it's instantaneous so but what
 

675
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,319
of config it's instantaneous so but what
is cool about web fig this web interface

676
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,329
is cool about web fig this web interface
 

677
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,390
is cool about web fig this web interface
so notice I'm accessing this through the

678
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:27,400
so notice I'm accessing this through the
 

679
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,350
so notice I'm accessing this through the
IP address of the router is that if I

680
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
IP address of the router is that if I
 

681
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,560
IP address of the router is that if I
were to brick my mikrotik and I don't

682
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,570
were to brick my mikrotik and I don't
 

683
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,670
were to brick my mikrotik and I don't
want to lose the settings that I've

want to lose the settings that I've
 

685
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,500
want to lose the settings that I've
created presumably you've backed them up

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:37,510
created presumably you've backed them up
 

687
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,840
created presumably you've backed them up
because you can within web fig that's

688
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:39,850
because you can within web fig that's
 

689
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,890
because you can within web fig that's
part of the system so if I jump into

part of the system so if I jump into
 

691
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,040
part of the system so if I jump into
that do you I want to say it's in system

but even if you cannot get into the web
interface you can use wind box

728
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:40,930
interface you can use wind box
 

729
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,870
interface you can use wind box
I say it's a Windows application you can

730
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
I say it's a Windows application you can
 

731
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,480
I say it's a Windows application you can
download it and run it in wine on your

732
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,490
download it and run it in wine on your
 

733
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,910
download it and run it in wine on your
Linux box so do not be concerned about

734
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:47,920
Linux box so do not be concerned about
 

735
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,070
Linux box so do not be concerned about
that notice I can log in with no

736
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
that notice I can log in with no
 

737
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,990
that notice I can log in with no
password so I want to go into quick set

738
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
password so I want to go into quick set
 

739
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,930
password so I want to go into quick set
and just set myself password on my

740
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:54,940
and just set myself password on my
 

741
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,330
and just set myself password on my
router dum-dum 1 2 3

742
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,340
router dum-dum 1 2 3
 

743
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,320
router dum-dum 1 2 3
dum-dum 1 2 3 and apply that config and

744
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,330
dum-dum 1 2 3 and apply that config and
 

745
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,930
dum-dum 1 2 3 and apply that config and
so now if I log out and try to log in

746
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:03,940
so now if I log out and try to log in
 

747
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,600
so now if I log out and try to log in
again its gonna say authentication

748
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:06,610
again its gonna say authentication
 

749
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,710
again its gonna say authentication
failed so I'm gonna try dum-dum 1 2 3

750
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
failed so I'm gonna try dum-dum 1 2 3
 

751
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,230
failed so I'm gonna try dum-dum 1 2 3

ok folks
 

755
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,710
ok folks
best way to do that is use a tool like

756
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
best way to do that is use a tool like
 

757
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,770
best way to do that is use a tool like
like LastPass and generate a secure

758
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:19,780
like LastPass and generate a secure
 

759
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,470
like LastPass and generate a secure
password ok grab that make that your

760
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
password ok grab that make that your
 

761
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,650
password ok grab that make that your
password and and then use LastPass or

762
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:25,660
password and and then use LastPass or
 

763
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,360
password and and then use LastPass or
whatever password manager you're using

764
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,370
whatever password manager you're using
 

765
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,250
whatever password manager you're using
in order to memorize it and that's going

766
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,260
in order to memorize it and that's going
 

767
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,240
in order to memorize it and that's going
to keep you a lot safer

768
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,250
to keep you a lot safer
 

769
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,220
to keep you a lot safer
of course the interface is only

770
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,230
