00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:17,890
a series right now with micro tech
 

693
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,250
a series right now with micro tech
routers and this week we're gonna be

694

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,450
looking at how to configure port
 

697
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,600
looking at how to configure port
forwarding it's a little more

698
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:24,610
forwarding it's a little more
 

699
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,550
forwarding it's a little more
sophisticated with a micro tech as you

sophisticated with a micro tech as you
 

701
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,380

consumer router so stick around I'll

704
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:30,850
consumer router so stick around I'll
 

705
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,510
consumer router so stick around I'll
show you how to do it right after this

706
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:34,520

 

707
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:47,910

all right we've been looking at the

712
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:54,700
all right we've been looking at the
 

713
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,590

micro tech routers advanced routing with

714
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:58,600
micro tech routers advanced routing with
 

715
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,140
micro tech routers advanced routing with
these devices I mean they fall into this

716
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,150
these devices I mean they fall into this
 

717
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,320
these devices I mean they fall into this
interesting category all of their own in

718
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,330
interesting category all of their own in
 

719
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,140
interesting category all of their own in
a way because they're priced like a

720
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,150
a way because they're priced like a
 

721
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,480
a way because they're priced like a
consumer router but they have the

722
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,490
consumer router but they have the
 

723
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,840
consumer router but they have the
feature set of an enterprise router so

724
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:12,850
feature set of an enterprise router so
 

725
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,940
feature set of an enterprise router so
suddenly you're able to do so much more

726
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:14,950
suddenly you're able to do so much more
 

727
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,210
suddenly you're able to do so much more
you're able to protect your network way

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:18,220
you're able to protect your network way
 

729
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,460
you're able to protect your network way
better than you could with a consumer

730
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:20,470
better than you could with a consumer
 

731
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,070
better than you could with a consumer
router and you're you're able to do that

732
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,080
router and you're you're able to do that
 

733
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,590
router and you're you're able to do that
for about the same price or maybe a

734
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
for about the same price or maybe a
 

735
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,900
for about the same price or maybe a
little bit more but about the a tenth of

736
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:27,910
little bit more but about the a tenth of
 

737
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,450
little bit more but about the a tenth of
the price of an equivalent enterprise

738
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:30,460
the price of an equivalent enterprise
 

739
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,610

equivalent specs
 

769
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,569

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:19,480
dollars and you're doing it on these
 

775
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,319

consumer priced devices from micro tech
 

777
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,810
consumer priced devices from micro tech
so the device that I'm looking at here

778
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:24,820
so the device that I'm looking at here
 

779
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,030
so the device that I'm looking at here
at the studio is the router board RB

780
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,040
at the studio is the router board RB
 

781
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,440
at the studio is the router board RB
nine six to UI GS and that model is what

782
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,450
nine six to UI GS and that model is what
 

783
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,690
nine six to UI GS and that model is what
I've selected for us here at the studio

784
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:33,700
I've selected for us here at the studio
 

785
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,550
I've selected for us here at the studio
but it might not be exactly what you

786
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:35,560
but it might not be exactly what you
 

787
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,520
but it might not be exactly what you
want for your house or your home network

788
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:38,530
want for your house or your home network
 

789
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,820
want for your house or your home network
or your business network however that's

790
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:41,830
or your business network however that's
 

791
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,650
or your business network however that's
what's really cool about micro tech I

792
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:43,660
what's really cool about micro tech I
 

793
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,920
what's really cool about micro tech I
mean one of the things is that you just

794
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:46,930
mean one of the things is that you just
 

795
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,900
mean one of the things is that you just
pick the hardware that works for you and

796
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:48,910
pick the hardware that works for you and
 

797
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,540
pick the hardware that works for you and
the software is going to be the same

798
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:51,550
the software is going to be the same
 

799
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,180
the software is going to be the same
from device to device to device whether

800
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,190
from device to device to device whether
 

801
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,180
from device to device to device whether
you buy the thirty dollar unit or the

802
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,190
you buy the thirty dollar unit or the
 

803
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,909
you buy the thirty dollar unit or the
50 dollar unit or the 600 dollar unit it

804
00:17:58,909 --> 00:17:58,919
50 dollar unit or the 600 dollar unit it
 

805
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,560
50 dollar unit or the 600 dollar unit it
doesn't matter as far as the software

806
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,570
doesn't matter as far as the software
 

807
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,840
doesn't matter as far as the software
goes your only limitation is in the

808
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:02,850
goes your only limitation is in the
 

809
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,769
goes your only limitation is in the
hardware so where my device has both 2.4

810
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:06,779
hardware so where my device has both 2.4
 

811
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:10,310
hardware so where my device has both 2.4
and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi antennas and and

812
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi antennas and and
 

813
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,159
and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi antennas and and
and transmitters you may buy a cheaper

814
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:13,169
and transmitters you may buy a cheaper
 

815
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:16,340
and transmitters you may buy a cheaper
device that only has 2.4 or only has 5

816
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,350
device that only has 2.4 or only has 5
 

817
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,730
device that only has 2.4 or only has 5
so those features will be limited only

818
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:19,740
so those features will be limited only
 

819
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,310
so those features will be limited only
by the hardware but the software itself

820
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
by the hardware but the software itself
 

821
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,440
by the hardware but the software itself
is the same so I I always start by

822
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,450
is the same so I I always start by
 

823
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,180
is the same so I I always start by
saying that because I want you to

824
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,190
saying that because I want you to
 

825
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,070
saying that because I want you to
understand you don't have to buy the

826
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
understand you don't have to buy the
 

827
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,190
understand you don't have to buy the
same one I bought you find the one that

828
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
same one I bought you find the one that
 

829
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
same one I bought you find the one that
works for you and then you can follow

830
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,210
works for you and then you can follow
 

831
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,789
works for you and then you can follow
along with the series and amazingly even

832
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:37,799
along with the series and amazingly even
 

833
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,159
along with the series and amazingly even
if you have a different model altogether

834
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:40,169
if you have a different model altogether
 

835
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,720
if you have a different model altogether
you're gonna be able to follow the

836
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:41,730
you're gonna be able to follow the
 

837
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,009
you're gonna be able to follow the
screen you're gonna be able to follow

838
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:43,019
screen you're gonna be able to follow
 

839
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:45,320
screen you're gonna be able to follow
the steps and it's going to be exactly

840
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,330
the steps and it's going to be exactly
 

841
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:52,669
the steps and it's going to be exactly
the same that is amazing so this week

842
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:52,679
the same that is amazing so this week
 

843
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,879
the same that is amazing so this week
I'm going to be looking at how to set up

844
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:54,889
I'm going to be looking at how to set up
 

845
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:57,680
I'm going to be looking at how to set up
port forwarding we're gonna call it now

846
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:57,690
port forwarding we're gonna call it now
 

847
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,480
port forwarding we're gonna call it now
mikrotik is going to call it NAT

848
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,490
mikrotik is going to call it NAT
 

849
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,419
mikrotik is going to call it NAT
firewall rules I'm gonna talk a little

850
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:02,429
firewall rules I'm gonna talk a little
 

851
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,610
firewall rules I'm gonna talk a little
bit about that in a moment but we know

852
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:04,620
bit about that in a moment but we know
 

853
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,799
bit about that in a moment but we know
it as port forwarding or redirecting and

854
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:06,809
it as port forwarding or redirecting and
 

855
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:09,919
it as port forwarding or redirecting and
that is that when someone hits our

856
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:09,929
that is that when someone hits our
 

857
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,190
that is that when someone hits our
public IP address at a certain port if

858
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
public IP address at a certain port if
 

859
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,680
public IP address at a certain port if
it's a port that I have allowed and that

860
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:15,690
it's a port that I have allowed and that
 

861
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,990
it's a port that I have allowed and that
I recognize I want it to reroute to the

862
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
I recognize I want it to reroute to the
 

863
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,629
I recognize I want it to reroute to the
appropriate server so in my case I have

864
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:20,639
appropriate server so in my case I have
 

865
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:26,810
appropriate server so in my case I have
a server at 10.0.0.0

866
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:26,820

 

867
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,889

it's my own personal kind of alternative

868
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:30,899
it's my own personal kind of alternative
 

869
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:35,740
it's my own personal kind of alternative
to Google cloud services and drive and

870
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:35,750
to Google cloud services and drive and
 

871
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,499
to Google cloud services and drive and
onedrive and all those kinds of services

872
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:39,509
onedrive and all those kinds of services
 

873
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,629
onedrive and all those kinds of services
I'm able to put them on my own server

874
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:41,639
I'm able to put them on my own server
 

875
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,610
I'm able to put them on my own server
and it's mine it's my own hosted system

876
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:45,620
and it's mine it's my own hosted system
 

877
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,539
and it's mine it's my own hosted system
at 10.0.0.0 open ports 80 and port 443

878
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:50,549
at 10.0.0.0 open ports 80 and port 443
 

879
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,659
at 10.0.0.0 open ports 80 and port 443
so if someone hits my IP or I actually

880
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:53,669
so if someone hits my IP or I actually
 

881
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:55,940
so if someone hits my IP or I actually
have a DNS record because we have

882
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:55,950
have a DNS record because we have
 

883
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,669
have a DNS record because we have
category 5 TV of course so I have Studio

884
00:19:58,669 --> 00:19:58,679
category 5 TV of course so I have Studio
 

885
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,299
category 5 TV of course so I have Studio
dot category 5 dot TV is going to route

886
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:02,309
dot category 5 dot TV is going to route
 

887
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,999
dot category 5 dot TV is going to route
them to here and that's going to then

888
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:05,009
them to here and that's going to then
 

889
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,919
them to here and that's going to then
hit the micro tech and the micro tech is

890
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:06,929
hit the micro tech and the micro tech is
 

891
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,269
hit the micro tech and the micro tech is
going to say ok what do I do with this

892
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:08,279
going to say ok what do I do with this
 

893
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,049
going to say ok what do I do with this
traffic

894
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:09,059
traffic
 

895
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,110
traffic
what am I gonna do so I have to tell my

896
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,120
what am I gonna do so I have to tell my
 

897
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,739
what am I gonna do so I have to tell my
mikrotik hey that's port 443 I want to

898
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:15,749
mikrotik hey that's port 443 I want to
 

899
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:20,810
mikrotik hey that's port 443 I want to
route that to 10.0.0.0 because that is

900
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:20,820
route that to 10.0.0.0 because that is
 

901
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,879
route that to 10.0.0.0 because that is
presumably what this person is trying to

902
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:22,889
presumably what this person is trying to
 

903
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:27,590
presumably what this person is trying to
access so let's jump right into it I'm

904
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
access so let's jump right into it I'm
 

905
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,899
access so let's jump right into it I'm
gonna hop over to our mikrotik and

906
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:29,909
gonna hop over to our mikrotik and
 

907
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,799
gonna hop over to our mikrotik and
things are so sophisticated over here so

908
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:33,809
things are so sophisticated over here so
 

909
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,659
things are so sophisticated over here so
just follow along and you're gonna start

910
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:35,669
just follow along and you're gonna start
 

911
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,639
just follow along and you're gonna start
to pick up on how things work I've

912
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:37,649
to pick up on how things work I've
 

913
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:40,610
to pick up on how things work I've
clicked on IP last week we came here

914
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:40,620
clicked on IP last week we came here
 

915
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,590
clicked on IP last week we came here
because we started looking at the DHCP

916
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:42,600
because we started looking at the DHCP
 

917
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,570
because we started looking at the DHCP
server and static rules and things like

918
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:44,580
server and static rules and things like
 

919
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,879
server and static rules and things like
that which will expand upon in time I'm

920
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:46,889
that which will expand upon in time I'm
 

921
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,509
that which will expand upon in time I'm
gonna hit firewall these are the default

922
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:50,519
gonna hit firewall these are the default
 

923
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,690
gonna hit firewall these are the default

want to add some rules that are going to
 

927
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,220
want to add some rules that are going to
reroute traffic within my network now

and I'll reroute it remember the
 

935
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:08,210
and I'll reroute it remember the
mikrotik allows me to have much more

936
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,220
mikrotik allows me to have much more
 

937
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,090
mikrotik allows me to have much more
control over that so I'm going to be

938
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,100
control over that so I'm going to be
 

939
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,749
control over that so I'm going to be
setting up NAT rules first that is

940
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:14,759
setting up NAT rules first that is
 

941
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,289
setting up NAT rules first that is
network address translation so those

942
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:18,299
network address translation so those
 

943
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,230
network address translation so those
rules are going to decide ok if someone

944
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,240
rules are going to decide ok if someone
 

945
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,629
rules are going to decide ok if someone
hits this port where do I want to send

946
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:23,639
hits this port where do I want to send
 

947
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:27,049
hits this port where do I want to send
it within the land ok where am I going

948
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:27,059
it within the land ok where am I going
 

949
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,440
it within the land ok where am I going
to allow them to access but then it's

950
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,450
to allow them to access but then it's
 

951
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,690
to allow them to access but then it's
still not going to work unlike a

952
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:32,700
still not going to work unlike a
 

953
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,399
still not going to work unlike a
consumer router that is just going to

954
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:34,409
consumer router that is just going to
 

955
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,940
consumer router that is just going to
say okay I'm just gonna basically D DMZ

956
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:37,950
say okay I'm just gonna basically D DMZ
 

957
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,369
say okay I'm just gonna basically D DMZ
that server and allow anyone to get

958
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:40,379
that server and allow anyone to get
 

959
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:42,049
that server and allow anyone to get
through and allow them to hack in and

960
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:42,059
through and allow them to hack in and
 

961
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,460
through and allow them to hack in and
whatever they want to do as soon as you

00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,470
whatever they want to do as soon as you
 

963
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,549
whatever they want to do as soon as you
say go the the mikrotik is going to say

964
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
say go the the mikrotik is going to say
 

965
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,950
say go the the mikrotik is going to say
okay no I'll allow traffic through

966
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
okay no I'll allow traffic through
 

967
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,049
okay no I'll allow traffic through
however they are subject to some rules

968
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:51,059
however they are subject to some rules
 

969
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,230
however they are subject to some rules
you may have some other rules that

970
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
you may have some other rules that
 

971
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,759
you may have some other rules that
you've added to your mikrotik device

972
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:55,769
you've added to your mikrotik device
 

973
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:58,570
you've added to your mikrotik device
that say I'm only going to allow a

974
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:58,580
that say I'm only going to allow a
 

975
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,180
that say I'm only going to allow a
particular IP address to access this so

976
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,190
particular IP address to access this so
 

977
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,369
particular IP address to access this so
that might be my home IP address or my

978
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:04,379
that might be my home IP address or my
 

979
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:07,220
that might be my home IP address or my
office it may be that I've set up a rule

980
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,230
office it may be that I've set up a rule
 

981
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,330
office it may be that I've set up a rule
that says I never travel I'm always in

982
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:11,340
that says I never travel I'm always in
 

983
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,090
that says I never travel I'm always in
Canada I'm always in fact in Ontario so

984
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,100
Canada I'm always in fact in Ontario so
 

985
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,159
Canada I'm always in fact in Ontario so
if anyone ever tries to access my

if
 

993
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,070
if
I'm in Ontario so like there's all kinds

994
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm in Ontario so like there's all kinds
 

995
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,100
I'm in Ontario so like there's all kinds
of like it's a hierarchal kind of way of

996
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,110
of like it's a hierarchal kind of way of
 

997
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,840
of like it's a hierarchal kind of way of
looking at those router router rules to

998
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:32,850
looking at those router router rules to
 

999
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,970
looking at those router router rules to
redirect traffic to certain servers

1000
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:34,980
redirect traffic to certain servers
 

1001
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,130
redirect traffic to certain servers
within your network you can imagine

1002
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,140
within your network you can imagine
 

1003
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,660
within your network you can imagine
that's helpful for home because it's

1004
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:38,670
that's helpful for home because it's
 

1005
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,130
that's helpful for home because it's
giving you more security but it's also

1006
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,140
giving you more security but it's also
 

1007
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,800
giving you more security but it's also
exceptional for business it whether you

1008
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:42,810
exceptional for business it whether you
 

1009
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,550
exceptional for business it whether you
own or run an IT department at a small

1010
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:46,560
own or run an IT department at a small
 

1011
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,710
own or run an IT department at a small
medium-sized business or even a large

1012
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
medium-sized business or even a large
 

1013
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,780
medium-sized business or even a large
business micro tech is going to give you

1014
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:50,790
business micro tech is going to give you
 

1015
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,690
business micro tech is going to give you
so much more control over those kinds of

1016
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:53,700
so much more control over those kinds of
 

1017
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,560
so much more control over those kinds of
rules so let's start with our nat rule

1018
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:57,570
rules so let's start with our nat rule
 

1019
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,490
rules so let's start with our nat rule
and again nat is a short form term that

1020
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:01,500
and again nat is a short form term that
 

1021
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,530
and again nat is a short form term that
we use a stands for network address

1022
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:03,540
we use a stands for network address
 

1023
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,010
we use a stands for network address
translation and it basically tells our

1024
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,020
translation and it basically tells our
 

1025
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,320
translation and it basically tells our
network traffic where to flow based on

1026
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,330
network traffic where to flow based on
 

1027
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,990
network traffic where to flow based on
the rules that i've set up but they're

1028
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
the rules that i've set up but they're
 

1029
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,640
the rules that i've set up but they're
still not going to be allowed i'm going

1030
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:13,650
still not going to be allowed i'm going
 

1031
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,900
still not going to be allowed i'm going
to show you that in just a couple of

1032
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:14,910
to show you that in just a couple of
 

1033
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,150
to show you that in just a couple of
moments time so I know that I'm gonna

1034
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,160
moments time so I know that I'm gonna
 

1035
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,770
moments time so I know that I'm gonna
need port 80 and port 443 to route my

1036
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,780
need port 80 and port 443 to route my
 

1037
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,870
need port 80 and port 443 to route my
traffic for next cloud and I should

1038
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:23,880
traffic for next cloud and I should
 

1039
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,970
traffic for next cloud and I should
start by showing you that hey if I

1040
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:25,980
start by showing you that hey if I
 

1041
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,940
start by showing you that hey if I
actually go to studio dot category five

1042
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:28,950
actually go to studio dot category five
 

1043
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,300
actually go to studio dot category five
dot TV it's just gonna hang it's gonna

1044
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,310
dot TV it's just gonna hang it's gonna
 

1045
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,340
dot TV it's just gonna hang it's gonna
timeout it's not gonna go anywhere

1046
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,350
timeout it's not gonna go anywhere
 

1047
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,890
timeout it's not gonna go anywhere
because I haven't set up those rules yet

1048
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:36,900
because I haven't set up those rules yet
 

1049
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,220
because I haven't set up those rules yet
so that spin spin spin spin spin but

1050
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,230
so that spin spin spin spin spin but
 

1051
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,180
so that spin spin spin spin spin but
I'll leave that open

1052
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,190
I'll leave that open
 

1053
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,940
I'll leave that open
so my nat rule first of all i've created

1054
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:43,950
so my nat rule first of all i've created
 

1055
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,830
so my nat rule first of all i've created
a new nat rule so IP firewall nat new

1056
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
a new nat rule so IP firewall nat new
 

1057
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,830
a new nat rule so IP firewall nat new
rule and now I'm gonna change the chain

1058
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
rule and now I'm gonna change the chain
 

1059
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,900
rule and now I'm gonna change the chain
here I want to say it say that this is

1060
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:53,910
here I want to say it say that this is
 

1061
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,850
here I want to say it say that this is
the destination map because I'm setting

1062
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:55,860
the destination map because I'm setting
 

1063
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,640
the destination map because I'm setting
the destination within my internal

1064
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:58,650
the destination within my internal
 

1065
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,920
the destination within my internal
network I need to also set the protocol

1066
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:00,930
network I need to also set the protocol
 

1067
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,420
network I need to also set the protocol
because I want to specify that this is

1068
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,430
because I want to specify that this is
 

1069
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,480
because I want to specify that this is
actually TCP and you can see that there

1070
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:05,490
actually TCP and you can see that there
 

1071
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,160
actually TCP and you can see that there
are tons of protocols that you can

1072
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,170
are tons of protocols that you can
 

1073
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,280
are tons of protocols that you can
choose from I'm just setting up TCP on

1074
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,290
choose from I'm just setting up TCP on
 

1075
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,900
choose from I'm just setting up TCP on
port 80 and then port 443 to get us

1076
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:14,910
port 80 and then port 443 to get us

the browser so that you can see that you
 

1089
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,710
the browser so that you can see that you
don't need to have a tool installed to

don't need to have a tool installed to

don't need to have a tool installed to
be able to admin

be able to admin

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,250
be able to admin
you're mikrotik router I think there's a

1094
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:37,260
you're mikrotik router I think there's a
 

1095
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,140
you're mikrotik router I think there's a
misconception as soon as I say install

1096
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,150
misconception as soon as I say install
 

1097
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,730
misconception as soon as I say install
wind box and use that to connect to your

1098
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:40,740
wind box and use that to connect to your
 

1099
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,590
wind box and use that to connect to your
router it creates a misconception that

1100
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:42,600
router it creates a misconception that
 

1101
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,930
router it creates a misconception that
makes you feel like oh this it has to be

1102
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:44,940
makes you feel like oh this it has to be
 

1103
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,360
makes you feel like oh this it has to be
managed from a tool no but that's a

1104
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,370
managed from a tool no but that's a
 

1105
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,710
managed from a tool no but that's a
helpful tool to be able to give you

1106
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
helpful tool to be able to give you
 

1107
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
helpful tool to be able to give you
access to your router and it does

1108
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:50,730
access to your router and it does
 

1109
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,910
access to your router and it does
provide some exceptional additional

1110
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:52,920
provide some exceptional additional
 

1111
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,940
provide some exceptional additional
services like my multitasking so give it

1112
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:55,950
services like my multitasking so give it
 

1113
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,980
services like my multitasking so give it
a try but I'm gonna do most of this

1114
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:57,990
a try but I'm gonna do most of this
 

1115
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,350
a try but I'm gonna do most of this
through the browser because I think that

1116
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:00,360
through the browser because I think that
 

1117
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,510
through the browser because I think that
that's a better way to show you as

1118
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:02,520
that's a better way to show you as
 

1119
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,850
that's a better way to show you as
you're just learning your Microtech so

1120
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:04,860
you're just learning your Microtech so
 

1121
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,130
you're just learning your Microtech so
I've set it to destination that I've set

1122
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,140
I've set it to destination that I've set
 

1123
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,430
I've set it to destination that I've set
it to TCP as the protocol which is

1124
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,440
it to TCP as the protocol which is
 

1125
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,110
it to TCP as the protocol which is
number six and I need to set my

1126
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,120
number six and I need to set my
 

1127
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,450
number six and I need to set my
destination port and this destination

1128
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:14,460
destination port and this destination
 

1129
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,500
destination port and this destination
port is the port on the external network

1130
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:18,510
port is the port on the external network
 

1131
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,870
port is the port on the external network
so don't get confused with that which I

1132
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
so don't get confused with that which I
 

1133
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,690
so don't get confused with that which I
tend to sometimes do because sometimes

1134
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:23,700
tend to sometimes do because sometimes
 

1135
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,600
tend to sometimes do because sometimes
you may have a situation where your

1136
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:26,610
you may have a situation where your
 

1137
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,910
you may have a situation where your
public port is different than the

1138
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:28,920
public port is different than the
 

1139
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,700
public port is different than the
private port in this case as we're

1140
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:31,710
private port in this case as we're
 

1141
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,710
private port in this case as we're
setting up our NAT rule we are setting

1142
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:33,720
setting up our NAT rule we are setting
 

1143
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,190
setting up our NAT rule we are setting
the external port here so in in my case

1144
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
the external port here so in in my case
 

1145
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,260
the external port here so in in my case
it's going to match the internal port

1146
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,270
it's going to match the internal port
 

1147
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,330
it's going to match the internal port
but just keep that in mind that this

1148
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,340
but just keep that in mind that this
 

1149
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,880
but just keep that in mind that this
let's say your we want it to answer on

1150
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:43,890
let's say your we want it to answer on
 

1151
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,480
let's say your we want it to answer on
port 8080 you could add that there even

1152
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,490
port 8080 you could add that there even
 

1153
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,180
port 8080 you could add that there even
though the server in house is responding

1154
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,190
though the server in house is responding
 

1155
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,810
though the server in house is responding
on port 80 so just keep in mind that

1156
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:53,820
on port 80 so just keep in mind that
 

1157
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,030
on port 80 so just keep in mind that
might be different but in my case it's

1158
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,040
might be different but in my case it's
 

1159
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,820
might be different but in my case it's
in fact not different alright I need to

1160
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:58,830
in fact not different alright I need to
 

1161
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,540
in fact not different alright I need to
look at my interface so there's the in

1162
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:01,550
look at my interface so there's the in
 

1163
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,300
look at my interface so there's the in
interface I need to say this is going to

1164
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,310
interface I need to say this is going to
 

1165
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,020
interface I need to say this is going to
be Ethernet one in my case it may be a

1166
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,030
be Ethernet one in my case it may be a
 

1167
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,550
be Ethernet one in my case it may be a
little bit different for you just keep

1168
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:10,560
little bit different for you just keep
 

1169
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,230
little bit different for you just keep
in mind that what I am actually doing

1170
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
in mind that what I am actually doing
 

1171
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,840
in mind that what I am actually doing
there as I am selecting my internet

1172
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:14,850
there as I am selecting my internet
 

1173
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,420
there as I am selecting my internet
interface remember when I first set up

1174
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:17,430
interface remember when I first set up
 

1175
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,290
interface remember when I first set up
this router on our first episode of this

1176
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:21,300
this router on our first episode of this
 

1177
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,570
this router on our first episode of this
series I demonstrated that I was

1178
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:23,580
series I demonstrated that I was
 

1179
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,680
series I demonstrated that I was
plugging my internet modem into Ethernet

1180
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:27,690
plugging my internet modem into Ethernet
 

1181
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,350
plugging my internet modem into Ethernet
one port one and so that's what I'm

1182
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,360
one port one and so that's what I'm
 

1183
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,600
one port one and so that's what I'm
specifying here I want this to respond

1184
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:32,610
specifying here I want this to respond
 

1185
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,500
specifying here I want this to respond
on my internet interface and as you can

1186
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:36,510
on my internet interface and as you can
 

1187
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,870
on my internet interface and as you can
imagine you can dig deep and you can set

1188
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
imagine you can dig deep and you can set
 

1189
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,730
imagine you can dig deep and you can set
this up on you know you could be doing

1190
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:40,740
this up on you know you could be doing
 

1191
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,750
this up on you know you could be doing
things very sophisticated by specifying

1192
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:44,760
things very sophisticated by specifying
 

1193
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,210
things very sophisticated by specifying
different ports setting up VLANs all

1194
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,220
different ports setting up VLANs all
 

1195
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,920
different ports setting up VLANs all
that kind of stuff we're keeping things

1196
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:48,930
that kind of stuff we're keeping things
 

1197
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,340
that kind of stuff we're keeping things
simple and just going about it that way

1198
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,350
simple and just going about it that way
 

1199
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,010
simple and just going about it that way
all right I'm gonna scroll way down here

1200
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,020
all right I'm gonna scroll way down here
 

1201
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,730
all right I'm gonna scroll way down here
to action and just make sure that this

1202
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:58,740
to action and just make sure that this
 

1203
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:06,650
to action and just make sure that this
is set to DN DST net destination net so

1204
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:06,660
is set to DN DST net destination net so
 

1205
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,230
is set to DN DST net destination net so
that is going to route this traffic to

1206
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,240
that is going to route this traffic to
 

1207
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,110
that is going to route this traffic to
our server so now scroll down a little

1208
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,120
our server so now scroll down a little
 

1209
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,310
our server so now scroll down a little
ways here and you're gonna find two

1210
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320
ways here and you're gonna find two
 

1211
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,480
ways here and you're gonna find two
ports there it is my two port is

1212
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:20,490
ports there it is my two port is
 

1213
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,710
ports there it is my two port is
actually going to be the same notice

1214
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:21,720
actually going to be the same notice
 

1215
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,870
actually going to be the same notice
that's giving me a range I'm just going

1216
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:23,880
that's giving me a range I'm just going
 

1217
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,050
that's giving me a range I'm just going
to specify port 80 and at the very very

1218
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,060
to specify port 80 and at the very very
 

1219
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,150
to specify port 80 and at the very very
bottom here there's an opportunity for

1220
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,160
bottom here there's an opportunity for
 

1221
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,890
bottom here there's an opportunity for
you to create a comment I'm going to do

1222
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:30,900
you to create a comment I'm going to do
 

1223
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,570
you to create a comment I'm going to do
that I'm gonna say next cloud 80 finally

1224
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:35,580
that I'm gonna say next cloud 80 finally
 

1225
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,610
that I'm gonna say next cloud 80 finally
the one last thing that I need to add

1226
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:37,620
the one last thing that I need to add
 

1227
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,960
the one last thing that I need to add
here is the destination IP address

1228
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:40,970
here is the destination IP address
 

1229
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,150
here is the destination IP address
internally on my network this is the

1230
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,160
internally on my network this is the
 

1231
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,470
internally on my network this is the
server as I mentioned 1000 a that this

1232
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
server as I mentioned 1000 a that this
 

1233
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,070
server as I mentioned 1000 a that this
NAT rule is going to respond on port 80

1234
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
NAT rule is going to respond on port 80
 

1235
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,240
NAT rule is going to respond on port 80
and redirect to 10.0.0.0 so now I'm

1236
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,250
and redirect to 10.0.0.0 so now I'm
 

1237
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,480
and redirect to 10.0.0.0 so now I'm
going to scroll all the way up and hit

1238
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,490
going to scroll all the way up and hit
 

1239
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,150
going to scroll all the way up and hit
OK and now we'll see that we have a new

1240
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,160
OK and now we'll see that we have a new
 

1241
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,670
OK and now we'll see that we have a new
rule called next cloud 80 and it's

1242
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:07,680
rule called next cloud 80 and it's
 

1243
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,780
rule called next cloud 80 and it's
responding DST net and it's pointing TCP

1244
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:11,790
responding DST net and it's pointing TCP
 

1245
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,560
responding DST net and it's pointing TCP
on port 80 through Ethernet one two as

1246
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,570
on port 80 through Ethernet one two as
 

1247
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:22,000
on port 80 through Ethernet one two as
we know from setting it up 10.0.0.0

1248
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,010

 

1249
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,040

secure port as well follow those same

1250
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,050
secure port as well follow those same
 

1251
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,900
secure port as well follow those same
steps I'm going to change the chain to

1252
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:26,910
steps I'm going to change the chain to
 

1253
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,490
steps I'm going to change the chain to
destination that I'm gonna change my

1254
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:30,500
destination that I'm gonna change my
 

1255
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,990
destination that I'm gonna change my
protocol to TCP and then I'm going to

1256
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,000
protocol to TCP and then I'm going to
 

1257
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,840
protocol to TCP and then I'm going to
change my external my in interface to

1258
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:40,850
change my external my in interface to
 

1259
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:47,960
change my external my in interface to
Ethernet one destination port I know I'm

1260
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:47,970
Ethernet one destination port I know I'm
 

1261
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,820
Ethernet one destination port I know I'm
a little bit out of order that's okay

1262
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:49,830
a little bit out of order that's okay
 

1263
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,770
a little bit out of order that's okay
you know what I'm doing destination port

1264
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:51,780
you know what I'm doing destination port
 

1265
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,320
you know what I'm doing destination port
is 4 4 3 let's scroll way down here and

1266
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,330
is 4 4 3 let's scroll way down here and
 

1267
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,660
is 4 4 3 let's scroll way down here and
change our action to DST NAT and our two

1268
00:28:59,660 --> 00:28:59,670
change our action to DST NAT and our two
 

1269
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,770
change our action to DST NAT and our two
address

1270
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:00,780
address
 

1271
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,640
address
same server just different port and then

1272
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:05,650
same server just different port and then
 

1273
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:13,460
same server just different port and then
to port 443 and give it a comment here

1274
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:13,470
to port 443 and give it a comment here
 

1275
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:18,750
to port 443 and give it a comment here
next cloud 443 all right I think I've

1276
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:18,760
next cloud 443 all right I think I've
 

1277
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,750
next cloud 443 all right I think I've
got everything there looks good

1278
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,760
got everything there looks good
 

1279
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,770
got everything there looks good
let's hit okay so now I've got port 80

1280
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:25,780
let's hit okay so now I've got port 80
 

1281
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,789
let's hit okay so now I've got port 80
and port 443 nat rules going to ten dot

1282
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:29,799
and port 443 nat rules going to ten dot
 

1283
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:32,240
and port 443 nat rules going to ten dot
0 dot 0 dot

1284
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,250
0 dot 0 dot
 

1285
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:37,260
0 dot 0 dot
from the Ethernet one port over TCP it's

1286
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,270
from the Ethernet one port over TCP it's
 

1287
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,940
from the Ethernet one port over TCP it's
still not going to work so if I jump

1288
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:38,950
still not going to work so if I jump
 

1289
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,780
still not going to work so if I jump
over here I'm gonna hit f5 to refresh oh

1290
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:42,790
over here I'm gonna hit f5 to refresh oh
 

1291
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,049
over here I'm gonna hit f5 to refresh oh
and it is working look at that because

1292
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:46,059
and it is working look at that because
 

1293
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,419
and it is working look at that because
I'm internal on the internal land so I'm

1294
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:48,429
I'm internal on the internal land so I'm
 

1295
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:50,370
I'm internal on the internal land so I'm
not actually on the Ethernet one it's

1296
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:50,380
not actually on the Ethernet one it's
 

1297
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,810
not actually on the Ethernet one it's
not going to work from the outside world

1298
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:51,820
not going to work from the outside world
 

1299
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,549
not going to work from the outside world
yet because the outside world is is

1300
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
yet because the outside world is is
 

1301
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,500
yet because the outside world is is
coming in through Ethernet one

1302
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:58,510
coming in through Ethernet one
 

1303
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,680
coming in through Ethernet one
I'm obviously internal I'm on port two

1304
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:01,690
I'm obviously internal I'm on port two
 

1305
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm obviously internal I'm on port two
as you'll remember from last week so in

1306
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,210
as you'll remember from last week so in
 

1307
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,630
as you'll remember from last week so in
order to give access to the outside

1308
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
order to give access to the outside
 

1309
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,820
order to give access to the outside
world now I need to go over to the

1310
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:08,830
world now I need to go over to the
 

1311
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,539
world now I need to go over to the
firewall rules tab here and click on add

1312
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:12,549
firewall rules tab here and click on add
 

1313
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,520
firewall rules tab here and click on add
new so this is where I'm actually saying

1314
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:14,530
new so this is where I'm actually saying
 

1315
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,880
new so this is where I'm actually saying
ok if the firewall gets hit I need to

1316
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:17,890
ok if the firewall gets hit I need to
 

1317
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,730
ok if the firewall gets hit I need to
trigger that nat rule so let's do that

1318
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:20,740
trigger that nat rule so let's do that
 

1319
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,780
trigger that nat rule so let's do that
so we've added a new firewall rule and

1320
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:24,790
so we've added a new firewall rule and
 

1321
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,470
so we've added a new firewall rule and
I'm gonna change the chain let's see no

1322
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm gonna change the chain let's see no
 

1323
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,230
I'm gonna change the chain let's see no
it's already defaulting to forward so

1324
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,240
it's already defaulting to forward so
 

1325
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,669
it's already defaulting to forward so
that's fine

1326
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:32,679
that's fine
 

1327
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,659
that's fine
source IP address this is kind of cool

1328
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:36,669
source IP address this is kind of cool
 

1329
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,299
source IP address this is kind of cool
I'm not going to set this but I just

1330
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:39,309
I'm not going to set this but I just
 

1331
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm not going to set this but I just
want to I want you to see this this can

1332
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:41,710
want to I want you to see this this can
 

1333
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,030
want to I want you to see this this can
be the IP address that you want to allow

1334
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,040
be the IP address that you want to allow
 

1335
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,500
be the IP address that you want to allow
remember I mentioned you could set it so

1336
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:46,510
remember I mentioned you could set it so
 

1337
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,090
remember I mentioned you could set it so
that only your home network is allowed

1338
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,100
that only your home network is allowed
 

1339
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,190
that only your home network is allowed
to do this you could do that add your

1340
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,200
to do this you could do that add your
 

1341
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,890
to do this you could do that add your
home IP address you can even create IP

1342
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:52,900
home IP address you can even create IP
 

1343
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,250
home IP address you can even create IP
groups that would that would be set up

1344
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,260
groups that would that would be set up
 

1345
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,070
groups that would that would be set up
here that's down here source address

1346
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,080
here that's down here source address
 

1347
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,860
here that's down here source address
list see that so these are things that

1348
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:01,870
list see that so these are things that
 

1349
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,630
list see that so these are things that
we're gonna be learning in time right

1350
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:03,640
we're gonna be learning in time right
 

1351
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,740
we're gonna be learning in time right
now I'm not going to do that I'm not

1352
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:04,750
now I'm not going to do that I'm not
 

1353
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,870
now I'm not going to do that I'm not
gonna set a source address I'm going to

1354
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:06,880
gonna set a source address I'm going to
 

1355
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,180
gonna set a source address I'm going to
open this up to the world but I want you

1356
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,190
open this up to the world but I want you
 

1357
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,760
open this up to the world but I want you
to know that that is available to you so

1358
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:11,770
to know that that is available to you so
 

1359
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,280
to know that that is available to you so
moving along destination I address is in

1360
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,290
moving along destination I address is in
 

1361
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,220
moving along destination I address is in
fact the internal server so that's

1362
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,230
fact the internal server so that's
 

1363
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:25,470
fact the internal server so that's
10.0.0.0 that is TCP so click that and

1364
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:25,480
10.0.0.0 that is TCP so click that and
 

1365
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,930
10.0.0.0 that is TCP so click that and
it TCP is in fact the default so that

1366
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:27,940
it TCP is in fact the default so that
 

1367
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,820
it TCP is in fact the default so that
just kind of saves us a quick time but

1368
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:29,830
just kind of saves us a quick time but
 

1369
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,440
just kind of saves us a quick time but
you can see all the protocols that are

1370
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,450
you can see all the protocols that are
 

1371
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,580
you can see all the protocols that are
available to us next step is we need to

1372
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:35,590
available to us next step is we need to
 

1373
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,540
available to us next step is we need to
set the service port so destination port

1374
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:39,550
set the service port so destination port
 

1375
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,620
set the service port so destination port
is going to be port 80 we're going to

1376
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:43,630
is going to be port 80 we're going to
 

1377
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,750
is going to be port 80 we're going to
start with we need to do both but I need

1378
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
start with we need to do both but I need
 

1379
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,250
start with we need to do both but I need
to set up each rule separately so there

1380
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,260
to set up each rule separately so there
 

1381
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,799
to set up each rule separately so there
we go in interface is going to be my

1382
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:52,809
we go in interface is going to be my
 

1383
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:55,140
we go in interface is going to be my
Ethernet one port as we already

1384
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,150
Ethernet one port as we already
 

1385
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,520
Ethernet one port as we already
established and so what I'm doing here

1386
00:31:59,520 --> 00:31:59,530
established and so what I'm doing here
 

1387
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,260
established and so what I'm doing here
is I'm actually telling the firewall

1388
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,270
is I'm actually telling the firewall
 

1389
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,780
is I'm actually telling the firewall
that I'm going to allow this traffic

1390
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:03,790
that I'm going to allow this traffic
 

1391
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,810
that I'm going to allow this traffic
from the the first Ethernet port which

1392
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:09,820
from the the first Ethernet port which
 

1393
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,669
from the the first Ethernet port which
is my internet connection and this is

1394
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
is my internet connection and this is
 

1395
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,620
is my internet connection and this is
the one where action needs to be set to

1396
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:13,630
the one where action needs to be set to
 

1397
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,410
the one where action needs to be set to
accept so this is where I'm saying yeah

1398
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:16,420
accept so this is where I'm saying yeah
 

1399
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,850

1411
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,290
create a comment just like we did before
I'm gonna call this firewall rule

1412
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:31,300
I'm gonna call this firewall rule
 

1413
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:37,580
I'm gonna call this firewall rule
comment next cloud 80 scroll way up and

notice that if you leave off the NAT

1416
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,840
notice that if you leave off the NAT
 

1417
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,470
notice that if you leave off the NAT
rule or you leave off the firewall rule

well you're missing some of the chains

1420
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:45,460
well you're missing some of the chains
 

1421
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,400
well you're missing some of the chains
so it's not going to actually respond

1422
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,410
so it's not going to actually respond
 

1423
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,020
so it's not going to actually respond
outside of your network so you need to

outside of your network so you need to
 

1425
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,660

folks you tell me I'm gonna hit ok so
 

1457
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,840
folks you tell me I'm gonna hit ok so
now here's the final step you notice

1458
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:41,850
now here's the final step you notice
 

1459
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,870
now here's the final step you notice
that these two items here are drop

1460
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
that these two items here are drop
 

1461
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,460
that these two items here are drop
forward rules in the firewall now it's

1462
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:49,470
forward rules in the firewall now it's
 

1463
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,300
forward rules in the firewall now it's
important to note that mikrotik works in

1464
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,310
important to note that mikrotik works in
 

1465
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,910
important to note that mikrotik works in
it basically in order so from top to

1466
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:55,920
it basically in order so from top to
 

1467
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,040
it basically in order so from top to
bottom so when you're looking at your

1468
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,050
bottom so when you're looking at your
 

1469
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,320
bottom so when you're looking at your
firewall rules if you're wondering why

1470
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,330
firewall rules if you're wondering why
 

1471
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,180
firewall rules if you're wondering why
are these still not working well it's

1472
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,190
are these still not working well it's
 

1473
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,720
are these still not working well it's
because before my rules that I just

1474
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:05,730
because before my rules that I just
 

1475
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,149
because before my rules that I just
configured there's already a rule that

1476
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
configured there's already a rule that
 

1477
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,940
configured there's already a rule that
says drop everything so basically this

1478
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:10,950
says drop everything so basically this
 

1479
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,530
says drop everything so basically this
is saying hey if you've passed all this

1480
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:12,540
is saying hey if you've passed all this
 

1481
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,710
is saying hey if you've passed all this
past all this past all this now drop the

1482
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:15,720
past all this past all this now drop the
 

1483
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,990
past all this past all this now drop the
connection right because these that's a

1484
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
connection right because these that's a
 

1485
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,180
connection right because these that's a
pretty solid firewall well then it never

1486
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,190
pretty solid firewall well then it never
 

1487
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,030
pretty solid firewall well then it never
gets here so I actually need to reorder

1488
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
gets here so I actually need to reorder
 

1489
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,320
gets here so I actually need to reorder
these and the way I'm going to do that

1490
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,330
these and the way I'm going to do that
 

1491
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,360
these and the way I'm going to do that
is I want these to happen or I want my

1492
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:26,370
is I want these to happen or I want my
 

1493
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,850
is I want these to happen or I want my
custom forwarding rules to happen right

1494
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:28,860
custom forwarding rules to happen right
 

1495
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,850
custom forwarding rules to happen right
after the final input rule so I should

1496
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:31,860
after the final input rule so I should
 

1497
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:38,980
after the final input rule so I should
be able to simply drag that up to here

1498
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:38,990
be able to simply drag that up to here
 

1499
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,649
be able to simply drag that up to here
there we go and grab the last one my

1500
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:42,659
there we go and grab the last one my
 

1501
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,740
there we go and grab the last one my
next cloud 4 for 3 rule drag that up in

1502
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:48,750
next cloud 4 for 3 rule drag that up in
 

1503
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,430
next cloud 4 for 3 rule drag that up in
there we go

1504
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:49,440
there we go

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:22,710

1527
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,260

commenting that when I add the comments

1530
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:26,849

1531
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:28,760
commenting that when I add the comments
you're not actually seeing them on the

00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:28,770
you're not actually seeing them on the
 

1533
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,460
you're not actually seeing them on the
screen and that's because category 5 is

1534
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,470
screen and that's because category 5 is
 

1535
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,910
screen and that's because category 5 is
18 / 9 and my computer screen is 16 / 9

1536
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:34,920
18 / 9 and my computer screen is 16 / 9
