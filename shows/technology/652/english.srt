316
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,170
so thank you for your patience so the
 

317
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,620
so thank you for your patience so the
first thing I want to do in web fig here

318
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:12,630
first thing I want to do in web fig here
 

319
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,170
first thing I want to do in web fig here
is I want to go into my wireless

320
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,180
is I want to go into my wireless
 

321
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,390
is I want to go into my wireless
security profiles so understand

322
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:17,400
security profiles so understand
 

323
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,980
security profiles so understand
I don't want those who are going to be

324
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:18,990
I don't want those who are going to be
 

325
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,440
I don't want those who are going to be
accessing my guest Wi-Fi to use the same

326
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,450
accessing my guest Wi-Fi to use the same
 

327
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,380
accessing my guest Wi-Fi to use the same
password as I use on my main Wi-Fi

328
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,390
password as I use on my main Wi-Fi
 

329
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,050
password as I use on my main Wi-Fi
that's particularly what I don't want to

330
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,060
that's particularly what I don't want to
 

331
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,420
that's particularly what I don't want to
be giving out so let's do that right now

332
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,430
be giving out so let's do that right now
 

333
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,190
be giving out so let's do that right now
let's set up a separate password by

334
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,200
let's set up a separate password by
 

335
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,960
let's set up a separate password by
clicking on wireless at the left here

336
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:32,970
clicking on wireless at the left here
 

337
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,090
clicking on wireless at the left here
and then I'm going to click on security

338
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,100
and then I'm going to click on security
 

339
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,799
and then I'm going to click on security
profiles at the

340
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:36,809
profiles at the
 

341
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,929
profiles at the
now click on add new and you'll see

342
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:39,939
now click on add new and you'll see
 

343
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,839
now click on add new and you'll see
default is actually my my network so

344
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:42,849
default is actually my my network so
 

345
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,390
default is actually my my network so
that's the password for my network the

346
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:45,400
that's the password for my network the
 

347
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,249
that's the password for my network the
Wi-Fi that I've already set up and I'm

348
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:47,259
Wi-Fi that I've already set up and I'm
 

349
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,869
Wi-Fi that I've already set up and I'm
gonna click add new and we're just going

350
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
gonna click add new and we're just going
 

351
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,439
gonna click add new and we're just going
to call this one guest just like that

352
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:52,449
to call this one guest just like that
 

353
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,049
to call this one guest just like that
one note is I want to turn off WPA PSK

354
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:55,059
one note is I want to turn off WPA PSK
 

355
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,100
one note is I want to turn off WPA PSK
because WPA as you know is very part of

356
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,110
because WPA as you know is very part of
 

357
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,260
because WPA as you know is very part of
me it's very easy to compromise so we

358
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,270
me it's very easy to compromise so we
 

359
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,260
me it's very easy to compromise so we
don't want to use WPA we only want to

360
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,270
don't want to use WPA we only want to
 

361
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,450
don't want to use WPA we only want to
use wpa2 because wpa2 is much safer as

362
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,460
use wpa2 because wpa2 is much safer as
 

363
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,200
use wpa2 because wpa2 is much safer as
far as somebody being able to hack into

364
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,210
far as somebody being able to hack into
 

365
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,100
far as somebody being able to hack into
your Wi-Fi network so turn off WPA PSK

366
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,110
your Wi-Fi network so turn off WPA PSK
 

367
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,239
your Wi-Fi network so turn off WPA PSK
leave wpa2 PSK enabled and then down

368
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:21,249
leave wpa2 PSK enabled and then down
 

369
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,219
leave wpa2 PSK enabled and then down
here because that is enabled we need to

370
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:23,229
here because that is enabled we need to
 

371
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,920
here because that is enabled we need to
enter a pre-shared key aka the password

372
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:25,930
enter a pre-shared key aka the password
 

373
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,350
enter a pre-shared key aka the password
for our network so I'm gonna use dum-dum

374
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,360
for our network so I'm gonna use dum-dum
 

375
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,679
for our network so I'm gonna use dum-dum
one two three four this guest Wi-Fi so

376
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:31,689
one two three four this guest Wi-Fi so
 

377
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,040
one two three four this guest Wi-Fi so
this is only for the guest Wi-Fi

378
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,050
this is only for the guest Wi-Fi
 

379
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,019
this is only for the guest Wi-Fi
remember that ok once I've entered my

380
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:37,029
remember that ok once I've entered my
 

381
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,050
remember that ok once I've entered my
password I'm going to hit OK so I

382
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,060
password I'm going to hit OK so I
 

383
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,209
password I'm going to hit OK so I
haven't actually created a network yet

384
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:42,219
haven't actually created a network yet
 

385
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,519
haven't actually created a network yet
all I've done is I've created a security

386
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:44,529
all I've done is I've created a security
 

387
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,340
all I've done is I've created a security
profile called guest and that security

388
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,350
profile called guest and that security
 

389
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,870
profile called guest and that security
profile contains the wpa2 shared key for

390
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:51,880
profile contains the wpa2 shared key for
 

391
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,509
profile contains the wpa2 shared key for
that guest network and I notice that my

392
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:54,519
that guest network and I notice that my
 

393
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,480
that guest network and I notice that my
default network is in fact using WPA pre

394
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,490
default network is in fact using WPA pre
 

395
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,220
default network is in fact using WPA pre
shared key so while we're here let's

396
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,230
shared key so while we're here let's
 

397
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,780
shared key so while we're here let's
open that one and let's turn off WPA PSK

398
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:03,790
open that one and let's turn off WPA PSK
 

399
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,689
open that one and let's turn off WPA PSK
because I do not want someone hacking

400
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:06,699
because I do not want someone hacking
 

401
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,379
because I do not want someone hacking
into my main network and hit OK

402
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:09,389
into my main network and hit OK
 

403
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,420
into my main network and hit OK
it only took a moment's time for my pine

404
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,430
it only took a moment's time for my pine
 

405
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,550
it only took a moment's time for my pine
Book Pro to disconnect from the Wi-Fi

406
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
Book Pro to disconnect from the Wi-Fi
 

407
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,100
Book Pro to disconnect from the Wi-Fi
and reconnect the password hasn't

408
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,110
and reconnect the password hasn't
 

409
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,829
and reconnect the password hasn't
changed simply the encryption algorithm

410
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
changed simply the encryption algorithm
 

411
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,949
changed simply the encryption algorithm
has changed so now as you can see on the

412
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
has changed so now as you can see on the
 

413
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
has changed so now as you can see on the
screen neither of my Wi-Fi security keys

414
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:25,930
screen neither of my Wi-Fi security keys
 

415
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,699
screen neither of my Wi-Fi security keys
will allow WPA they only allow wpa2 it's

416
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:29,709
will allow WPA they only allow wpa2 it's
 

417
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,650
will allow WPA they only allow wpa2 it's
as simple as that now jump into our

418
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:31,660
as simple as that now jump into our
 

419
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,750
as simple as that now jump into our
Wi-Fi interfaces this is where you see

420
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
Wi-Fi interfaces this is where you see
 

421
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,059
Wi-Fi interfaces this is where you see
my two gigahertz and five gigahertz

422
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:36,069
my two gigahertz and five gigahertz
 

423
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:38,340
my two gigahertz and five gigahertz
networks and I want to add a new one for

424
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,350
networks and I want to add a new one for
 

425
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,280
networks and I want to add a new one for
my guest Wi-Fi but I don't have another

426
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,290
my guest Wi-Fi but I don't have another
 

427
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,960
my guest Wi-Fi but I don't have another
radio so what are we gonna do we're

428
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:42,970
radio so what are we gonna do we're
 

429
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,750
radio so what are we gonna do we're
going to share the radio with one of my

430
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
going to share the radio with one of my
 

431
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,780
going to share the radio with one of my
W lands so we're not going to add

432
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:48,790
W lands so we're not going to add
 

433
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,550
W lands so we're not going to add
another radio we don't have to

434
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
another radio we don't have to
 

435
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,740
another radio we don't have to
by an access point or any kind of device

436
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:52,750
by an access point or any kind of device
 

437
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,870
by an access point or any kind of device
we're just going to use the same

438
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
we're just going to use the same
 

439
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,750
we're just going to use the same
mikrotik router so the only caveat of

440
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
mikrotik router so the only caveat of
 

441
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,420
mikrotik router so the only caveat of
that is that it means that the guest

442
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,430
that is that it means that the guest
 

443
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,860
that is that it means that the guest
Wi-Fi is going to be sharing the same

444
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:03,870
Wi-Fi is going to be sharing the same
 

445
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,550
Wi-Fi is going to be sharing the same
channel as our Wi-Fi like our actual

446
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,560
channel as our Wi-Fi like our actual
 

447
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,440
channel as our Wi-Fi like our actual
Wi-Fi for our network however because

448
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,450
Wi-Fi for our network however because
 

449
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,970
Wi-Fi for our network however because
it's a different network and it's a

450
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:11,980
it's a different network and it's a
 

451
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,030
it's a different network and it's a
different password they're not going to

452
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
different password they're not going to
 

453
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,130
different password they're not going to
be able to access our things it's just

454
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,140
be able to access our things it's just
 

455
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,010
be able to access our things it's just
going to be sharing the same the same

456
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,020
going to be sharing the same the same
 

457
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,780
going to be sharing the same the same
Channel whether or not that matters I

458
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:21,790
Channel whether or not that matters I
 

459
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,880
Channel whether or not that matters I
don't think it does

460
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:22,890
don't think it does
 

461
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,250
don't think it does
alright let's go add new and we're gonna

462
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,260
alright let's go add new and we're gonna
 

463
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,440
alright let's go add new and we're gonna
choose virtual because we are not

464
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,450
choose virtual because we are not
 

465
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,500
choose virtual because we are not
creating a real one now we're creating a

466
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:31,510
creating a real one now we're creating a
 

467
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,620
creating a real one now we're creating a
virtual network here on our wireless tab

468
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:34,630
virtual network here on our wireless tab
 

469
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,620
virtual network here on our wireless tab
in Wi-Fi interfaces so let's create a

470
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:37,630
in Wi-Fi interfaces so let's create a
 

471
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,100
in Wi-Fi interfaces so let's create a
virtual interface first thing I need to

472
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,110
virtual interface first thing I need to
 

473
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,560
virtual interface first thing I need to
do is always I mean give things a name

474
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:43,570
do is always I mean give things a name
 

475
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,210
do is always I mean give things a name
I'm going to call this one guest

476
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:45,220
I'm going to call this one guest
 

477
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm going to call this one guest
- Wi-Fi and you'll notice I'm using

478
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:47,770
- Wi-Fi and you'll notice I'm using
 

479
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,030
- Wi-Fi and you'll notice I'm using
guests throughout you might use your

480
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
guests throughout you might use your
 

481
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,130
guests throughout you might use your
last name or your family name or

482
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,140
last name or your family name or
 

483
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,010
last name or your family name or
something fun for your guest Wi-Fi you

484
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,020
something fun for your guest Wi-Fi you
 

485
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,960
something fun for your guest Wi-Fi you
can do that but for the sake of making

486
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:57,970
can do that but for the sake of making
 

487
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,780
can do that but for the sake of making
this tutorial universally accessible and

488
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:00,790
this tutorial universally accessible and
 

489
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,540
this tutorial universally accessible and
easy to follow I'm using guests because

490
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:03,550
easy to follow I'm using guests because
 

491
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,430
easy to follow I'm using guests because
anyone can go through these steps and

492
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
anyone can go through these steps and
 

493
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,530
anyone can go through these steps and
then retrace and rename things if you

494
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:07,540
then retrace and rename things if you
 

495
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,010
then retrace and rename things if you
want to but you don't have to do that so

496
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,020
want to but you don't have to do that so
 

497
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,980
want to but you don't have to do that so
on this network let's scroll down just a

498
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:13,990
on this network let's scroll down just a
 

499
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,300
on this network let's scroll down just a
little ways and we're going to see

500
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,310
little ways and we're going to see
 

501
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,110
little ways and we're going to see
something here called SSID we know that

502
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
something here called SSID we know that
 

503
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,630
something here called SSID we know that
the SSID for our network is basically

504
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:21,640
the SSID for our network is basically
 

505
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,730
the SSID for our network is basically
what you see when you bring up your

506
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:23,740
what you see when you bring up your
 

507
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,040
what you see when you bring up your
phone and you access the Wi-Fi and you

508
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,050
phone and you access the Wi-Fi and you
 

509
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,810
phone and you access the Wi-Fi and you
see a list of the different networks so

510
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:27,820
see a list of the different networks so
 

511
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,770
see a list of the different networks so
right now I see cat 5 TV and cat 5 TV -

512
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:31,780
right now I see cat 5 TV and cat 5 TV -
 

513
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,710
right now I see cat 5 TV and cat 5 TV -
5g and about a billion other Wi-Fi

514
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
5g and about a billion other Wi-Fi
 

515
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,230
5g and about a billion other Wi-Fi
networks around me but I want to give

516
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,240
networks around me but I want to give
 

517
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,079
networks around me but I want to give
this one an SSID that designates this

518
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,089
this one an SSID that designates this
 

519
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,600
this one an SSID that designates this
the guest Wi-Fi now in our case today

520
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,610
the guest Wi-Fi now in our case today
 

521
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,630
the guest Wi-Fi now in our case today
I'm going to call this SSID simply

522
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm going to call this SSID simply
 

523
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,510
I'm going to call this SSID simply
guessed again I'm going to refer back to

524
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:48,520
guessed again I'm going to refer back to
 

525
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,949
guessed again I'm going to refer back to
my comment that we're just making this

526
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:49,959
my comment that we're just making this
 

527
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,800
my comment that we're just making this
universally accessible but you can call

528
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:52,810
universally accessible but you can call
 

529
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,750
universally accessible but you can call
that whatever you want this could be I

530
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:54,760
that whatever you want this could be I
 

531
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,840
that whatever you want this could be I
could call this cat 5 TV - guest which

532
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:57,850
could call this cat 5 TV - guest which
 

533
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,730
could call this cat 5 TV - guest which
would be very appropriate because if

534
00:11:59,730 --> 00:11:59,740
would be very appropriate because if
 

535
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,380
would be very appropriate because if
there's some other network called guest

536
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,390
there's some other network called guest
 

537
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,520
there's some other network called guest
because that's pretty generic

538
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:02,530
because that's pretty generic
 

539
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,850
because that's pretty generic
that could cause a

540
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:03,860
that could cause a
 

541
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,910
that could cause a
conflict but also it just makes it so

542
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:06,920
conflict but also it just makes it so
 

543
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,139
conflict but also it just makes it so
that when people come into the studio

544
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:08,149
that when people come into the studio
 

545
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,690
that when people come into the studio
they can say oh that's the guest Wi-Fi

546
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:10,700
they can say oh that's the guest Wi-Fi
 

547
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,030
they can say oh that's the guest Wi-Fi
for cat5 TV hey what's the password

548
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
for cat5 TV hey what's the password
 

549
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,930
for cat5 TV hey what's the password
dum-dum 1 2 3 nice and simple right but

550
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:16,940
dum-dum 1 2 3 nice and simple right but
 

551
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,880
dum-dum 1 2 3 nice and simple right but
for today's demonstration we are just

552
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:18,890
for today's demonstration we are just
 

553
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,329
for today's demonstration we are just
gonna go with guest and now the final

554
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:22,339
gonna go with guest and now the final
 

555
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,560
gonna go with guest and now the final
thing that we need to do of course is

556
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:23,570
thing that we need to do of course is
 

557
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,630
thing that we need to do of course is
set our security profile for the Wi-Fi

558
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:25,640
set our security profile for the Wi-Fi
 

559
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,920
set our security profile for the Wi-Fi
connection and we're gonna change that

560
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:26,930
connection and we're gonna change that
 

561
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,650
connection and we're gonna change that
from default to guest so that's gonna

562
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:29,660
from default to guest so that's gonna
 

563
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,300
from default to guest so that's gonna
set so that we're using the password

564
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,310
set so that we're using the password
 

565
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,030
set so that we're using the password
dum-dum 1 2 3 as we specified with that

566
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,040
dum-dum 1 2 3 as we specified with that
 

567
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,310
dum-dum 1 2 3 as we specified with that
security profile and that's literally

568
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
security profile and that's literally
 

569
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,740
security profile and that's literally
all there is to adding the interface hit

570
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:38,750
all there is to adding the interface hit
 

571
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,970
all there is to adding the interface hit
ok now because I am making changes to my

572
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:42,980
ok now because I am making changes to my
 

573
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,720
ok now because I am making changes to my
Wi-Fi setup and because my pine Book Pro

574
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:46,730
Wi-Fi setup and because my pine Book Pro
 

575
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,269
Wi-Fi setup and because my pine Book Pro
is connected to my Wi-Fi right now

576
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
is connected to my Wi-Fi right now
 

577
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,389
is connected to my Wi-Fi right now
remember that Wi-Fi now the router is

578
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
remember that Wi-Fi now the router is
 

579
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,160
remember that Wi-Fi now the router is
not rebooting my servers and everything

580
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,170
not rebooting my servers and everything
 

581
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,509
not rebooting my servers and everything
my Internet's not going down

582
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
my Internet's not going down
 

583
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,639
my Internet's not going down
however the Wi-Fi is going to hiccup

584
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:57,649
however the Wi-Fi is going to hiccup
 

585
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,290
however the Wi-Fi is going to hiccup
there because the Wi-Fi transmitter is

586
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:01,300
there because the Wi-Fi transmitter is
 

587
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,610
there because the Wi-Fi transmitter is
restarting or reloading those

588
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:03,620
restarting or reloading those
 

589
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,639
restarting or reloading those
configuration settings on its own so now

590
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:06,649
configuration settings on its own so now
 

591
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,530
configuration settings on its own so now
that that's finished reloading those

592
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:08,540
that that's finished reloading those
 

593
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,810
that that's finished reloading those
settings you'll see now that under

594
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:10,820
settings you'll see now that under
 

595
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,389
settings you'll see now that under
wireless Wi-Fi interfaces I have one

596
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:13,399
wireless Wi-Fi interfaces I have one
 

597
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,930
wireless Wi-Fi interfaces I have one
called guest Wi-Fi and that is a virtual

598
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:16,940
called guest Wi-Fi and that is a virtual
 

599
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,030
called guest Wi-Fi and that is a virtual
interface connecting to my Wi-Fi so the

600
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,040
interface connecting to my Wi-Fi so the
 

601
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,590
interface connecting to my Wi-Fi so the
next thing we need to do is we need to

602
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
next thing we need to do is we need to
 

603
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,840
next thing we need to do is we need to
start routing how the traffic is going

604
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:25,850
start routing how the traffic is going
 

605
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,579
start routing how the traffic is going
to flow and do you get the sense here

606
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:27,589
to flow and do you get the sense here
 

607
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,410
to flow and do you get the sense here
that hey if you if you follow these

608
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:29,420
that hey if you if you follow these
 

609
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,030
that hey if you if you follow these
steps and if you understand the steps

610
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
steps and if you understand the steps
 

611
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,180
steps and if you understand the steps
involved in setting up a mikrotik router

612
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,190
involved in setting up a mikrotik router
 

613
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,350
involved in setting up a mikrotik router
you can do some really sophisticated

614
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
you can do some really sophisticated
 

615
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,110
you can do some really sophisticated
stuff at the top of this demonstration I

616
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,120
stuff at the top of this demonstration I
 

617
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,180
stuff at the top of this demonstration I
did warn that this is going to be kind

618
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,190
did warn that this is going to be kind
 

619
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,970
did warn that this is going to be kind
of complicated not that it's hard it's

620
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:42,980
of complicated not that it's hard it's
 

621
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,860
of complicated not that it's hard it's

network is 10.0.0.0 dot zero dot one two
 

777
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:04,689
network is 10.0.0.0 dot zero dot one two
three four so on and Counting so I'm

778
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:04,699
three four so on and Counting so I'm
 

779
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,260
three four so on and Counting so I'm
gonna create a new IP block by simply

780
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,270
gonna create a new IP block by simply
 

781
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,020
gonna create a new IP block by simply
clicking add new and we're gonna make

782
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,030
clicking add new and we're gonna make
 

783
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,250
clicking add new and we're gonna make
this one a little different so we're

784
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,260
this one a little different so we're
 

785
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:20,049
this one a little different so we're
gonna go with 10.10 dot dot 1/24 and on

786
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:20,059
gonna go with 10.10 dot dot 1/24 and on
 

787
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,240
gonna go with 10.10 dot dot 1/24 and on
the interface guess which interface

788
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,250
the interface guess which interface
 

789
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,720
the interface guess which interface
we're gonna use here folks bridge -

790
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:25,730
we're gonna use here folks bridge -
 

791
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,960
we're gonna use here folks bridge -
guest that's the comment field that I

792
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:28,970
guest that's the comment field that I
 

793
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,340
guest that's the comment field that I
was talking about last week that we

794
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,350
was talking about last week that we
 

795
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,840
was talking about last week that we
didn't really see we don't need that in

796
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:31,850
didn't really see we don't need that in
 

797
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,659
didn't really see we don't need that in
this case but you can add comments to

798
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:34,669
this case but you can add comments to
 

799
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,520
this case but you can add comments to
anything that you add in web thick hit

800
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:36,530
anything that you add in web thick hit
 

801
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,680
anything that you add in web thick hit
ok so now we have a new network here

802
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,690
ok so now we have a new network here
 

803
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,970
ok so now we have a new network here
called 10.10 10.1 and it will assign I

804
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:42,980
called 10.10 10.1 and it will assign I
 

805
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,280
called 10.10 10.1 and it will assign I
well we will inevitably when we set up a

806
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,290
well we will inevitably when we set up a
 

807
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,070
well we will inevitably when we set up a
DHCP server see there's lots of steps it

808
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
DHCP server see there's lots of steps it
 

809
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
DHCP server see there's lots of steps it
will assign IP addresses on that IP

810
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,290
will assign IP addresses on that IP
 

811
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,760
will assign IP addresses on that IP
block so speaking of DHCP server that's

812
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:54,770
block so speaking of DHCP server that's
 

813
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,409
block so speaking of DHCP server that's
our next step so we're gonna jump over

814
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:56,419
our next step so we're gonna jump over
 

815
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,960
our next step so we're gonna jump over
here and under IP which is already open

816
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,970
here and under IP which is already open
 

817
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,880
here and under IP which is already open
already expanded and we're gonna click

818
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:00,890
already expanded and we're gonna click
 

819
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,760
already expanded and we're gonna click
on DHCP server and here you can see my

820
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:03,770
on DHCP server and here you can see my
 

821
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,399
on DHCP server and here you can see my
current running DHCP server but the

822
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:06,409
current running DHCP server but the
 

823
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:07,870
current running DHCP server but the
thing with this is that it's got kind of

824
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:07,880
thing with this is that it's got kind of
 

825
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,820
thing with this is that it's got kind of
a weird name out of the box so I first

826
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:09,830
a weird name out of the box so I first
 

827
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,840
a weird name out of the box so I first
thing I want to do is I want to open

828
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,850
thing I want to do is I want to open
 

829
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,310
thing I want to do is I want to open
that and I'm just gonna rename this one

830
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
that and I'm just gonna rename this one
 

831
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,440
that and I'm just gonna rename this one
local and the reason I want to do that

832
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,450
local and the reason I want to do that
 

833
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,049
local and the reason I want to do that
is I want to always remind myself that

834
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:17,059
is I want to always remind myself that
 

835
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,710
is I want to always remind myself that
that DHCP pool is my local network it

836
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
that DHCP pool is my local network it
 

837
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,080
that DHCP pool is my local network it
has full access to everything on my

838
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,090
has full access to everything on my
 

839
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,060
has full access to everything on my
network you do not want to assign a

840
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,070
network you do not want to assign a
 

841
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,520
network you do not want to assign a
guest to that so by calling it local it

842
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:27,530
guest to that so by calling it local it
 

843
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,810
guest to that so by calling it local it
just keeps me a little bit more safe

844
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:28,820
just keeps me a little bit more safe
 

845
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,780
just keeps me a little bit more safe
because it stands out as that is

846
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:31,790
because it stands out as that is
 

847
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,820
because it stands out as that is
definitely my local network now let's

848
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:33,830
definitely my local network now let's
 

849
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,640
definitely my local network now let's
add a new DHCP server and you can see

850
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,650
add a new DHCP server and you can see
 

851
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,230
add a new DHCP server and you can see
that there's all this setup that you can

852
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
that there's all this setup that you can
 

853
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,970
that there's all this setup that you can
go through but I want to show you a tool

854
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:39,980
go through but I want to show you a tool
 

855
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,890
go through but I want to show you a tool
that's going to help make this even

856
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:41,900
that's going to help make this even
 

857
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,140
that's going to help make this even
easier so I just brought that up but

858
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,150
easier so I just brought that up but
 

859
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,640
easier so I just brought that up but
cancel and you can see there's actually

860
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:45,650
cancel and you can see there's actually
 

861
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,399
cancel and you can see there's actually
a DHCP setup and that's going to bring

862
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:48,409
a DHCP setup and that's going to bring
 

863
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,560
a DHCP setup and that's going to bring
up a wizard that is going to make this a

864
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:50,570
up a wizard that is going to make this a
 

865
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,230
up a wizard that is going to make this a
lot simpler for us and this is literally

866
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,240
lot simpler for us and this is literally
 

867
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,690
lot simpler for us and this is literally
easy breezy we're gonna change the DHCP

868
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:55,700
easy breezy we're gonna change the DHCP
 

869
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,480
easy breezy we're gonna change the DHCP
server interface to bridge - guest and

870
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,490
server interface to bridge - guest and
 

871
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,870
server interface to bridge - guest and
then watch this we're gonna hit next

872
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
then watch this we're gonna hit next
 

873
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,510
then watch this we're gonna hit next
next see it automatically assigned it to

874
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:04,520
next see it automatically assigned it to
 

875
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,210
next see it automatically assigned it to
the correct network next next DNS

876
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:10,220
the correct network next next DNS
 

877
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,070
the correct network next next DNS

880
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,850
that's fine we can change we're gonna
 

881
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,669
that's fine we can change we're gonna
actually change those in a future

882
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
actually change those in a future
 

883
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,820
actually change those in a future
episode when we set up a pie hole that's

899
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,090
done whoo we've got guest 1 and notice
okay well why is it DHCP 1

900
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,100
okay well why is it DHCP 1

well my bridge guest I can see that it's

902
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:48,440
well my bridge guest I can see that it's
 

903

the exact same thing I can open that up
 

909
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,580
the exact same thing I can open that up
and call this guest

easy-peasy right ok so now I'm at the
 

913
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,799
easy-peasy right ok so now I'm at the
point where I should be able to see the

914
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:02,809
point where I should be able to see the
 

915
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,500
point where I should be able to see the
guest Wi-Fi network on my phone so let's

916
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,510
guest Wi-Fi network on my phone so let's
 

917
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,510
guest Wi-Fi network on my phone so let's
do a quick refresh of Wi-Fi here and

918
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520
do a quick refresh of Wi-Fi here and
 

919
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,789
do a quick refresh of Wi-Fi here and
sure enough there's cat 5 TV 5 gigahertz

920
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:09,799
sure enough there's cat 5 TV 5 gigahertz
 

921
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,580
sure enough there's cat 5 TV 5 gigahertz
cat 5 TV and one called guest so let's

922
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:12,590
cat 5 TV and one called guest so let's
 

923
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,669
cat 5 TV and one called guest so let's
click it actually before I do that I'm

924
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
click it actually before I do that I'm
 

925
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,980
click it actually before I do that I'm
gonna bring up a local network resource

926
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:17,990
gonna bring up a local network resource
 

927
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,830
gonna bring up a local network resource

unconnected to cat 5 TV I want you to
see that I am in fact able to access

930
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:23,830
see that I am in fact able to access
 

931
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,380
see that I am in fact able to access
local resources so let's just bring up

932
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:26,390
local resources so let's just bring up
 

933
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,830
local resources so let's just bring up
my VirtualBox login there it is so once

934
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
my VirtualBox login there it is so once
 

935
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,039
my VirtualBox login there it is so once
I switch over to the guest Wi-Fi I'm

936
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,049
I switch over to the guest Wi-Fi I'm
 

937
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,330
I switch over to the guest Wi-Fi I'm
gonna use that as a demonstration to

938
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,340
gonna use that as a demonstration to
 

939
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,830
gonna use that as a demonstration to
show whether or not we're able to access

940
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
show whether or not we're able to access
 

941
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,649
show whether or not we're able to access
those resources so back in my Wi-Fi

942
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:38,659
those resources so back in my Wi-Fi
 

943
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:41,560
those resources so back in my Wi-Fi
let's connect to guest enter my password

what options do we have here let's look
 

953
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,020
what options do we have here let's look
at the IP address 10 see the Gateway 10

10 10 . 1 all right so let's let's look

956
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:03,340
10 10 . 1 all right so let's let's look
 

957
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,980
10 10 . 1 all right so let's let's look
at our browser again now that I'm

958
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:04,990
at our browser again now that I'm
 

959
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,420
at our browser again now that I'm
connected to that Network and let's try

960
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:06,430
connected to that Network and let's try
 

961
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,520
connected to that Network and let's try
to access PHP VirtualBox and you'll

962
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:08,530
to access PHP VirtualBox and you'll
 

963
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,520
to access PHP VirtualBox and you'll
notice yes I am indeed still able to

964
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:11,530
notice yes I am indeed still able to
 

965
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,950
notice yes I am indeed still able to
access PHP VirtualBox I've clicked on

966
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:13,960
access PHP VirtualBox I've clicked on
 

967
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,300
access PHP VirtualBox I've clicked on
the address bar and I've clicked on the

968
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,310
the address bar and I've clicked on the
 

969
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,030
the address bar and I've clicked on the
link and it is loading and that is

970
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,040
link and it is loading and that is
 

971
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,220
link and it is loading and that is
simply because I have yet to create a

972
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,230
simply because I have yet to create a
 

973
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,490
simply because I have yet to create a
firewall rule 2 basically and it trap

974
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:23,500
firewall rule 2 basically and it trap
 

975
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,090
firewall rule 2 basically and it trap
that Wi-Fi the guest access and make it

976
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,100
that Wi-Fi the guest access and make it
 

977
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,010
that Wi-Fi the guest access and make it
so that it's not allowed to communicate

978
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,020
so that it's not allowed to communicate
 

979
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,400
so that it's not allowed to communicate
back with my local area network or my

980
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,410
back with my local area network or my
 

981
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,270
back with my local area network or my
Wi-Fi devices on my actual Wi-Fi so the

982
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,280
Wi-Fi devices on my actual Wi-Fi so the
 

983
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,920

way that we're gonna do that is back on

984
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:37,930
way that we're gonna do that is back on
 

985
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,500
way that we're gonna do that is back on
our mikrotik web the Figg I'm going to

our mikrotik web the Figg I'm going to
 

987
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,350
our mikrotik web the Figg I'm going to
click I've opened IP and then we're

988
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
click I've opened IP and then we're
 

989
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,900
click I've opened IP and then we're
gonna go to firewall we've already seen

990
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:45,910
gonna go to firewall we've already seen
 

991
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,510
gonna go to firewall we've already seen

we were here but what I want to do this

998
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:54,850
we were here but what I want to do this
 

999
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,870
we were here but what I want to do this
time is I want to create a rule to be

1000
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:57,880
time is I want to create a rule to be
 

1001
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,330
time is I want to create a rule to be
able to make it so that the Wi-Fi for

1002
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:00,340
able to make it so that the Wi-Fi for
 

1003

able to make it so that the Wi-Fi for
the guest network is not able to get

the guest network is not able to get
 

1005
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:12,270
the guest network is not able to get
access to 10.0.0.0 all rule and you're

access to 10.0.0.0 all rule and you're
 

1007
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,250
access to 10.0.0.0 all rule and you're
gonna laugh at how easy this is you'll

1008
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:14,260
gonna laugh at how easy this is you'll
 

1009

1073
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,060
your things on your network it's just an
example but I mean you can probably

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,700
think of devices that you'd want to have
kind of separate from your network so

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:23,710
kind of separate from your network so
 

1079
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,380
kind of separate from your network so
that if somebody grabs it if somebody

1080
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,390
that if somebody grabs it if somebody
 

1081
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,460
that if somebody grabs it if somebody
steals that let's say you've got a

1082
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:26,470
steals that let's say you've got a
 

1083
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,960
steals that let's say you've got a
Raspberry Pi sitting in the roof

1084
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:27,970
Raspberry Pi sitting in the roof
 

1085
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,240
Raspberry Pi sitting in the roof
somewhere connected to your Wi-Fi well

1086
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,250
somewhere connected to your Wi-Fi well
 

1087
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,350
somewhere connected to your Wi-Fi well
if someone steals that you don't want

1088
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
if someone steals that you don't want
 

1089
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,299
if someone steals that you don't want
them having access to your network so

1090
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:33,309
them having access to your network so
 

1091
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,430
them having access to your network so
putting it on a separate network but

1092
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
putting it on a separate network but
 

1093
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,409
putting it on a separate network but
allowing you to be able to connect to it

1094
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:37,419
allowing you to be able to connect to it
 

1095
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:39,980
allowing you to be able to connect to it
so we understand that we're doing this

so we understand that we're doing this
unidirectionally this is only going to

unidirectionally this is only going to
 

1099
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,899
unidirectionally this is only going to
affect the guest Wi-Fi this is not

00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:44,909
affect the guest Wi-Fi this is not

has placed it at the bottom and we've
 

1111
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,230
has placed it at the bottom and we've
already talked about this we want to

1112
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,240
already talked about this we want to
 

1113
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,330
already talked about this we want to
make sure that our forward rules happen

1114
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:03,340
make sure that our forward rules happen
 

1115
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,789
make sure that our forward rules happen
before some of the mikrotik stuff and I

1116
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:05,799
before some of the mikrotik stuff and I
 

1117
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,320
before some of the mikrotik stuff and I
certainly want to make sure that this

1118
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,330
certainly want to make sure that this
 

1119
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,899
certainly want to make sure that this
happens before the rules that I've

1120
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:09,909
happens before the rules that I've
 

1121
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,779
happens before the rules that I've
created if they involve internal

1122
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:12,789
created if they involve internal
 

1123
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:15,029
created if they involve internal
infrastructure I want this one to happen

1124
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
infrastructure I want this one to happen
 

1125
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,290
infrastructure I want this one to happen
after

1126
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:17,300
after
 

1127
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,270
after
this no I don't I want it to happen

1128
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,280
this no I don't I want it to happen
 

1129
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,430
this no I don't I want it to happen
before this because if they're gonna

1130
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:22,440
before this because if they're gonna
 

1131
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:33,440
before this because if they're gonna
access 10.0.0.0 it they would actually

1132
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,450
access 10.0.0.0 it they would actually
 

1133
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:41,780
access 10.0.0.0 it they would actually
have access to 10.0.0.0 category-five TV

1134
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:41,790
have access to 10.0.0.0 category-five TV
 

1135
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,870
have access to 10.0.0.0 category-five TV
so I'm gonna drop as the first thing so

1136
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
so I'm gonna drop as the first thing so
 

1137
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
so I'm gonna drop as the first thing so

we're also going to learn in coming
 

1199
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,150
we're also going to learn in coming
weeks how we can throttle that I

1200
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:20,160
weeks how we can throttle that I
 

1201
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,920
weeks how we can throttle that I
mentioned that that we are going to be

1202
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:21,930
mentioned that that we are going to be
 

1203
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,360
mentioned that that we are going to be
looking at throttling but we're out of

1204
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,370
looking at throttling but we're out of
 

1205
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,480
looking at throttling but we're out of
time for this week segment so I will

1206
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:26,490
time for this week segment so I will
 

1207
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,750
time for this week segment so I will
move that into a future

1208
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:28,760
move that into a future
 

1209
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,430
move that into a future
as well so make sure you watch for that

1210
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:30,440
as well so make sure you watch for that
 

1211
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,080
as well so make sure you watch for that
we're gonna learn how to throttle the

1212
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,090
we're gonna learn how to throttle the
 

1213
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,600
we're gonna learn how to throttle the
connection for our guests Wi-Fi to make

1214
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:34,610
connection for our guests Wi-Fi to make
 

1215
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,730
connection for our guests Wi-Fi to make
sure that even you know if I give the

1216
