see okay so find your 2.4 gigahertz - so
 

555
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,210
see okay so find your 2.4 gigahertz - so
there it is - gigahertz it's the one in

556
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:42,220
there it is - gigahertz it's the one in

but find out which one it is you need to

562
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:50,649
but find out which one it is you need to
 

563
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,129
but find out which one it is you need to
know the name of that so in my case it's

564
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:53,139
know the name of that so in my case it's
 

565
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,759
know the name of that so in my case it's
all lowercase W LAN 1 now what I want to

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,269
in the course of this series I have
mentioned that the mikrotik is

mentioned that the mikrotik is
 

573
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,860
mentioned that the mikrotik is
programmable so that's essentially what

574

programmable so that's essentially what
 

575
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,730
programmable so that's essentially what
we're going to do we're going to program

we're going to do we're going to program
 

577
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,460
we're going to do we're going to program
it using the scheduler because you

578
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:11,470
it using the scheduler because you
 

579
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,079
it using the scheduler because you
mentioned that you want this to happen

580
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:13,089
mentioned that you want this to happen
 

581
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:14,879
mentioned that you want this to happen
you said at random times it's not

you said at random times it's not
 

583
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,069
you said at random times it's not
actually going to be random in our case

584
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:17,079
actually going to be random in our case

we'll do it on a schedule and it will

586
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:19,750
we'll do it on a schedule and it will
 

587
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,800
we'll do it on a schedule and it will
recur so it will turn on and then off

going to call this one name it

592
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:32,019
going to call this one name it

599
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,900
tomorrow's date I want to set it to
today just so that you see it happening

601
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,290
today just so that you see it happening
right away and

right away and
 

603
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,770
right away and
to set it to 12 o'clock on the button

604
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:47,780
to set it to 12 o'clock on the button
 

605
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,950
to set it to 12 o'clock on the button
with an interval now you would probably

606
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:50,960
with an interval now you would probably
 

607
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,680
with an interval now you would probably
if you want it to be every minute right

608
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:53,690
if you want it to be every minute right
 

609
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,080
if you want it to be every minute right
you could do something like that if you

610
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,090
you could do something like that if you
 

611
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,790
you could do something like that if you
want it to be every 10 minutes something

612
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:57,800
want it to be every 10 minutes something
 

613
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
want it to be every 10 minutes something
like that for the case of the for the

614
00:14:59,800 --> 00:14:59,810
like that for the case of the for the
 

615
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,970
like that for the case of the for the
sake of the demonstration I'm gonna do

616
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:00,980
sake of the demonstration I'm gonna do
 

617
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,580
sake of the demonstration I'm gonna do
every 10 seconds keeping in mind we're

618
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:03,590
every 10 seconds keeping in mind we're
 

619
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,980
every 10 seconds keeping in mind we're
going to be turning it on and off on and

620
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:05,990
going to be turning it on and off on and
 

621
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,660
going to be turning it on and off on and
off so it's actually gonna be every 5

622
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:07,670
off so it's actually gonna be every 5
 

623
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,400
off so it's actually gonna be every 5
seconds I'm going to set the intervals

624
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,410
seconds I'm going to set the intervals
 

625
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,460
seconds I'm going to set the intervals
as such so but that will just make it so

626
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,470
as such so but that will just make it so
 

627
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,560
as such so but that will just make it so
that we can see it right away so the on

628
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:14,570
that we can see it right away so the on
 

629
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,810
that we can see it right away so the on
event is where we're actually going to

630
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:16,820
event is where we're actually going to
 

631
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,020
event is where we're actually going to
program it so we're gonna say interphase

632
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,030
program it so we're gonna say interphase
 

633
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,490
program it so we're gonna say interphase
Wireless disable

634
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:21,500
Wireless disable
 

635
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,080
Wireless disable
what was the name of it W LAN 1 okay as

636
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,090
what was the name of it W LAN 1 okay as
 

637
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,210
what was the name of it W LAN 1 okay as
soon as I hit OK I'm gonna lose my W LAN

638
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,220
soon as I hit OK I'm gonna lose my W LAN
 

639
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,270
soon as I hit OK I'm gonna lose my W LAN
1 so if I head over to cos C its it's

640
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,280
1 so if I head over to cos C its it's
 

641
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,620
1 so if I head over to cos C its it's
already scheduled it and it's gonna say

642
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:32,630
already scheduled it and it's gonna say
 

643
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,090
already scheduled it and it's gonna say
run count and that's going to start

644
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,100
run count and that's going to start
 

645
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,250
run count and that's going to start
increasing see that one so now my

646
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,260
increasing see that one so now my
 

647
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,100
increasing see that one so now my
Wireless is off so if I go to wireless

648
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,110
Wireless is off so if I go to wireless
 

649
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,460
Wireless is off so if I go to wireless
now you can see W LAN 1 has been

650
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,470
now you can see W LAN 1 has been
 

651
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,650
now you can see W LAN 1 has been
disabled so go back to your scheduler

652
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:44,660
disabled so go back to your scheduler
 

653
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,540
disabled so go back to your scheduler
because we need to now the van is driven

654
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:46,550
because we need to now the van is driven
 

655
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,330
because we need to now the van is driven
away presumably right so we want to make

656
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:49,340
away presumably right so we want to make
 

657
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,170
away presumably right so we want to make
it so that the van has returned let's

658
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,180
it so that the van has returned let's
 

659
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,810
it so that the van has returned let's
put this into a scenario that maybe

660
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:55,820
put this into a scenario that maybe
 

661
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,580
put this into a scenario that maybe
makes a little more sense because I

662
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:57,590
makes a little more sense because I
 

663
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,980
makes a little more sense because I
understand rockaway CCW is being a

664
00:15:59,980 --> 00:15:59,990
understand rockaway CCW is being a
 

665
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,560
understand rockaway CCW is being a
little bit silly here but I'm still

666
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,570
little bit silly here but I'm still
 

667
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,600
little bit silly here but I'm still
happy to oblige let's think about a

668
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:04,610
happy to oblige let's think about a
 

669
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,060
happy to oblige let's think about a
parent who wants to be able to turn so

670
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,070
parent who wants to be able to turn so
 

671
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,040
parent who wants to be able to turn so
set your guest Wi-Fi use that tutorial

672
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,050
set your guest Wi-Fi use that tutorial
 

673
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,980
set your guest Wi-Fi use that tutorial
to create a Wi-Fi for your kids to use

674
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:14,990
to create a Wi-Fi for your kids to use
 

675
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,280
to create a Wi-Fi for your kids to use
then have it turn it off automatically

676
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,290
then have it turn it off automatically
 

677
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,710
then have it turn it off automatically
at curfew okay

678
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
at curfew okay
 

679
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,170
at curfew okay
so let's use that as the there's a

680
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,180
so let's use that as the there's a
 

681
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,360
so let's use that as the there's a
really good scenario I like that so

682
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,370
really good scenario I like that so
 

683
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,190
really good scenario I like that so
there you go

684
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,200
there you go
 

685
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,440
there you go
ok so here we are now creating remember

686
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,450
ok so here we are now creating remember
 

687
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,000
ok so here we are now creating remember
where I am here I'm under system

688
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,010
where I am here I'm under system
 

689
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,160
where I am here I'm under system
scheduler and I'm creating a new one so

690
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,170
scheduler and I'm creating a new one so
 

691
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,980
scheduler and I'm creating a new one so
add new I don't have anything to turn it

692
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:35,990
add new I don't have anything to turn it
 

693
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:42,190
add new I don't have anything to turn it
back on so re-enable 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi

694
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,200
back on so re-enable 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi
 

695
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,390
back on so re-enable 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi
and this could be any interface right it

696
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:46,400
and this could be any interface right it
 

697
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,480
and this could be any interface right it
doesn't have to be Wi-Fi in our case

698
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,490
doesn't have to be Wi-Fi in our case
 

699
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,520
doesn't have to be Wi-Fi in our case
where that's the demonstration but so

700
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:51,530
where that's the demonstration but so
 

701
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,620
where that's the demonstration but so
interface wireless and able W LAN

702
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:56,630
interface wireless and able W LAN
 

703
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,930
interface wireless and able W LAN
is what that one is called so now it's

704
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:58,940
is what that one is called so now it's
 

705
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,430
is what that one is called so now it's
to look at the schedule so remember I

706
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:00,440
to look at the schedule so remember I
 

707
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,620
to look at the schedule so remember I
set the other one to 12 o clock right on

708
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:05,630
set the other one to 12 o clock right on
 

709
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,480
set the other one to 12 o clock right on
the button so I'm setting this the same

710
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,490
the button so I'm setting this the same
 

711
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,390
the button so I'm setting this the same
just to make it easy for you to see on

712
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
just to make it easy for you to see on
 

713
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,490
just to make it easy for you to see on
the third which is when I'm filming this

714
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:12,500
the third which is when I'm filming this
 

715
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,710
the third which is when I'm filming this
live and we're setting this to 10

716
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
live and we're setting this to 10
 

717
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,990
live and we're setting this to 10
seconds so right now it's it's set to

718
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,000
seconds so right now it's it's set to
 

719
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,380
seconds so right now it's it's set to
happen at exactly the same time as our

720
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,390
happen at exactly the same time as our
 

721
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,029
happen at exactly the same time as our
other schedule which turns it off so

722
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:22,039
other schedule which turns it off so
 

723
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,289
other schedule which turns it off so
basically these are going to cancel each

724
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:23,299
basically these are going to cancel each
 

725
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,789
basically these are going to cancel each
other out so what I'm going to do is I'm

726
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
other out so what I'm going to do is I'm
 

727
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,130
other out so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to offset this one by 5 seconds so

728
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,140
going to offset this one by 5 seconds so
 

729
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,260
going to offset this one by 5 seconds so
every 5 seconds we're gonna have the

730
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,270
every 5 seconds we're gonna have the
 

731
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,940
every 5 seconds we're gonna have the
Wi-Fi turn off and then five seconds

732
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:30,950
Wi-Fi turn off and then five seconds
 

733
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,710
Wi-Fi turn off and then five seconds
later it's going to turn back on even

734
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
later it's going to turn back on even
 

735
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,810
later it's going to turn back on even
though each task is happening every 10

736
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:34,820
though each task is happening every 10
 

737
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,490
though each task is happening every 10
seconds

738
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:35,500
seconds
 

739
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,649
seconds
so if all goes well I'm gonna hit ok and

740
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:38,659
so if all goes well I'm gonna hit ok and
 

741
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,659
so if all goes well I'm gonna hit ok and
we should see that that one is going to

742
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:40,669
we should see that that one is going to
 

743
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,470
we should see that that one is going to
run and see the schedule there they're

744
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
run and see the schedule there they're
 

745
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,020
run and see the schedule there they're
off by 5 seconds re-enable has run ok

746
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,030
off by 5 seconds re-enable has run ok
 

747
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,289
off by 5 seconds re-enable has run ok
let's jump back over to wireless and

748
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:53,299
let's jump back over to wireless and
 

749
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,320
let's jump back over to wireless and
watch my WLAN just watch it I'm not

750
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,330
watch my WLAN just watch it I'm not
 

751
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,149
watch my WLAN just watch it I'm not
gonna touch a thing here my hands are

752
00:17:58,149 --> 00:17:58,159
gonna touch a thing here my hands are
 

753
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:05,470
gonna touch a thing here my hands are
off it's on watch wn1 and it's off that

754
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:05,480
off it's on watch wn1 and it's off that
 

755
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,010
off it's on watch wn1 and it's off that
is going to continue happening

756
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,020
is going to continue happening
 

757
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,090
is going to continue happening
indefinitely it's gonna keep going on

758
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,100
indefinitely it's gonna keep going on
 

759
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,250
indefinitely it's gonna keep going on
and off and on and off now use the

760
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,260
and off and on and off now use the
 

761
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,409
and off and on and off now use the
scenario that I gave you for those of

762
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:14,419
scenario that I gave you for those of
 

763
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,890
scenario that I gave you for those of
you who are not trying to simulate a van

764
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:16,900
you who are not trying to simulate a van
 

765
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,440
you who are not trying to simulate a van
and maybe use this to schedule that the

766
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,450
and maybe use this to schedule that the
 

767
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,210
and maybe use this to schedule that the
internet turns off for the particular

768
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:22,220
internet turns off for the particular
 

769
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,549
internet turns off for the particular
Wi-Fi that your kids are using at 9

770
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
Wi-Fi that your kids are using at 9
 

771
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,890
Wi-Fi that your kids are using at 9
o'clock p.m. and it turns back on at 7

772
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:26,900
o'clock p.m. and it turns back on at 7
 

773
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,750
o'clock p.m. and it turns back on at 7
o'clock in the morning or maybe you even

774
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:28,760
o'clock in the morning or maybe you even
 

775

Pro if you're newly arrived pine book
 

991
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,900
Pro if you're newly arrived pine book
pro simply won't boot first thing you

992
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,910
pro simply won't boot first thing you
 

993
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,430
pro simply won't boot first thing you
want to do is try to boot from an SD

994
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440
want to do is try to boot from an SD
 

995
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,520
want to do is try to boot from an SD
card and if it boots from the SD it's

996
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,530
card and if it boots from the SD it's
 

997

possible the emmc storage is disabled

998
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:35,830
possible the emmc storage is disabled
 

999
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,950
possible the emmc storage is disabled
with a hardware switch and you may need

1000
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:37,960
with a hardware switch and you may need
 

1001
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,000
with a hardware switch and you may need
to flip the emmc disabled switch

1002
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,010
to flip the emmc disabled switch
 

1003
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,920
to flip the emmc disabled switch
unfortunately it seems that while some

1004
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:43,930
unfortunately it seems that while some
 

1005
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,870
unfortunately it seems that while some
of the current run of pine book pros had

1006
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:45,880
of the current run of pine book pros had
 

1007
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,270
of the current run of pine book pros had
that switch enabled out of the factory

1008
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,280
that switch enabled out of the factory
 

1009
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,310
that switch enabled out of the factory
which means there emmc storage is

1010
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
which means there emmc storage is
 

1011
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,890
which means there emmc storage is
physically disabled and when I say emmc

1012
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:52,900
physically disabled and when I say emmc
 

1013
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,130
physically disabled and when I say emmc
think of that in terms of hard drive the

1014
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:56,140
think of that in terms of hard drive the
 

1015
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,620
think of that in terms of hard drive the

this procedure for the air this is the
 

1025
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,490
this procedure for the air this is the
hinge at the back and I'm just gonna

1026
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:11,500
hinge at the back and I'm just gonna
 

1027
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,790
hinge at the back and I'm just gonna
carefully pry upward but not all the way

1028
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:14,800
carefully pry upward but not all the way
 

1029

because the speakers are affixed with a

1030
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,530
because the speakers are affixed with a
 

1031
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,920
because the speakers are affixed with a
double-sided adhesive so I want to just

1032
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:19,930
double-sided adhesive so I want to just
 

1033
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,770
double-sided adhesive so I want to just
kind of carefully reach in here and peel

1034
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:22,780
kind of carefully reach in here and peel
 

1035
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,890
kind of carefully reach in here and peel
those off so one over here and one here

1036
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:25,900
those off so one over here and one here
 

1037
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,710
those off so one over here and one here
and the reason I've done that is because

1038
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
and the reason I've done that is because
 

1039
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,420
and the reason I've done that is because
I don't want to pull on these very very

that's included with your pine Book Pro

1074
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:12,220
that's included with your pine Book Pro
 

1075
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,330
that's included with your pine Book Pro
however as we can see here the switch is

1076
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:15,340
however as we can see here the switch is
 

1077
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,330
however as we can see here the switch is
set toward the front this is the switch

1078
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:18,340
set toward the front this is the switch
 

1079
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,830
set toward the front this is the switch
that enables and disables the emmc so

1080
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:22,840
that enables and disables the emmc so
 

1081
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,600
that enables and disables the emmc so
what I need to do is take that switch

1082
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:24,610
what I need to do is take that switch
 

1083
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,139
what I need to do is take that switch
and very carefully flip it toward the

1084
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:28,149
and very carefully flip it toward the
 

1085
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:30,840
and very carefully flip it toward the
hinge mechanism alright so I've just

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:30,850
hinge mechanism alright so I've just
 

1087
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,899
hinge mechanism alright so I've just
flipped that over and now it's as simple

1088
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:33,909
flipped that over and now it's as simple
 

1089
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,789
flipped that over and now it's as simple
as that let's put this case back on

1090
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:35,799
as that let's put this case back on
 

1091
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,060
as that let's put this case back on
being mindful of the sharp edges always

00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,070
being mindful of the sharp edges always
 

1093
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,250
being mindful of the sharp edges always
put the case back on before you flip it

1094
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:41,260
put the case back on before you flip it
 

1095
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,080
put the case back on before you flip it
over otherwise you may lose some of the

internal plastic components that kind of
 

1099
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,980
internal plastic components that kind of
elevate things flip that over and let's

1100
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:49,990
elevate things flip that over and let's
 

1101
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,680
elevate things flip that over and let's
give it a test so I'm going to carefully
