first computer that I ever sat down and
 

331
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,980

I used that thing like crazy like I I
got to the point where I was writing

336
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:17,940
got to the point where I was writing
 

337
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,060
got to the point where I was writing
code at you know five six years old

338
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,070
code at you know five six years old
 

339
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,140
code at you know five six years old
which incidentally you know I always

340
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,150
which incidentally you know I always
 

341
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,270
which incidentally you know I always
thought oh that's crazy like coding at

342
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,280
thought oh that's crazy like coding at
 

343
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,820
thought oh that's crazy like coding at
six years old and then my sons have done

344
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:28,830
six years old and then my sons have done
 

345

now our youngest is is coding in roblox

348
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:35,459
now our youngest is is coding in roblox
 

349
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:37,940
now our youngest is is coding in roblox
and it's and it's so that throws me back

350
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:37,950
and it's and it's so that throws me back

to those days and and I really like that
 

353
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,209
to those days and and I really like that
time where computers we understood how

354
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:44,219
time where computers we understood how
 

355
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,920
time where computers we understood how
they worked we understood the inner

356
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:45,930
they worked we understood the inner
 

357
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,870
they worked we understood the inner
workings of them so taking apart the

allowed to have a computer so it was
 

373
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,590
allowed to have a computer so it was
under blankets hidden in my closet like

374
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,600
under blankets hidden in my closet like
 

375
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,840
under blankets hidden in my closet like
that that's the kind of nerd I am that

376

that that's the kind of nerd I am that
 

377
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:19,350
that that's the kind of nerd I am that
as a child I hid an XT computer in my

378
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
as a child I hid an XT computer in my
 

379
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,720
as a child I hid an XT computer in my
closet so that my dad wouldn't find it

380
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:21,730
closet so that my dad wouldn't find it
 

381
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,840
closet so that my dad wouldn't find it
and get me in trouble I don't I can't

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:24,850
and get me in trouble I don't I can't
 

383
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,910
and get me in trouble I don't I can't
even imagine what I did with the monitor

384
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:26,920
even imagine what I did with the monitor
 

385
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,309
even imagine what I did with the monitor
I don't know how I figured out how to

386
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:29,319
I don't know how I figured out how to
 

387
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,199
I don't know how I figured out how to
hide a CRT monitor find it

388
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:31,209
hide a CRT monitor find it
 

389
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,329
hide a CRT monitor find it
I can't imagine he didn't but he never

390
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:33,339
I can't imagine he didn't but he never
 

391
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,210
I can't imagine he didn't but he never
mentioned it so I think he probably must

392
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,220
mentioned it so I think he probably must
 

393
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,460
mentioned it so I think he probably must
have known but my naive stupid kid mind

394
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,470
have known but my naive stupid kid mind
 

395
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,160
have known but my naive stupid kid mind
thinks that oh that dad doesn't know and

396
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,170
thinks that oh that dad doesn't know and
 

397
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,780
thinks that oh that dad doesn't know and
it's like this massive computer now how

398
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:45,790
it's like this massive computer now how
 

399
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,689
it's like this massive computer now how
long is it before you make the switch to

400
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:48,699
long is it before you make the switch to
 

401
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:51,840
long is it before you make the switch to
Linux well then those windows was a

402
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:51,850
Linux well then those windows was a
 

403
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,729
Linux well then those windows was a
complete switch yeah complete switch

404
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:53,739
complete switch yeah complete switch
 

405
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:58,049
complete switch yeah complete switch
right from there yeah I use an early

406
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:58,059
right from there yeah I use an early
 

407
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,319
right from there yeah I use an early
version of Adobe Photoshop in wine

408
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,329
version of Adobe Photoshop in wine
 

409
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,090
version of Adobe Photoshop in wine
because the old version ran fine under

410
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,100
because the old version ran fine under
 

411
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,340
because the old version ran fine under
under whines so and then as soon as like

412
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,350
under whines so and then as soon as like
 

413
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,609
under whines so and then as soon as like
cs2 came out it was no longer it wasn't

414
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:08,619
cs2 came out it was no longer it wasn't
 

415
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:10,139
cs2 came out it was no longer it wasn't
working quite what real quite right so

416
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:10,149
working quite what real quite right so
 

417
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:12,590
working quite what real quite right so
because back then was really bad

418
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,600
because back then was really bad
 

419
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,259
because back then was really bad
but they've since fixed that with 2.10

420
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:16,269
but they've since fixed that with 2.10
 

421
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:21,229
but they've since fixed that with 2.10
so like scaling is a lot better now but

to very carefully pry up that key and

628
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,090
to very carefully pry up that key and
 

629
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,570
to very carefully pry up that key and
get some compressed air underneath and

630
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:14,580
get some compressed air underneath and
 

631
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,570
get some compressed air underneath and
blow out underneath of the the contact

632
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:17,580
blow out underneath of the the contact
 

633
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,180
blow out underneath of the the contact
and for some reason that fixed it for

634
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,190
and for some reason that fixed it for
 

635
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,040
and for some reason that fixed it for
him so I'm glad to hear that the D key

636
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,050
him so I'm glad to hear that the D key
 

637
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,580
him so I'm glad to hear that the D key
is now working vp9 also mentioning that

638
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,590
is now working vp9 also mentioning that
 

639
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,970
is now working vp9 also mentioning that
while I showed on my pine Book Pro that

640
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:28,980
while I showed on my pine Book Pro that
 

641
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,380
while I showed on my pine Book Pro that
a quick tap on the pine logo and f11

642
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,390
a quick tap on the pine logo and f11
 

643
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,600
a quick tap on the pine logo and f11
would enable and disable Wi-Fi and that

644
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:35,610
would enable and disable Wi-Fi and that
 

645
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,520
would enable and disable Wi-Fi and that
seemed to work fine for for our

646
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,530
seemed to work fine for for our
 

647
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,190
seemed to work fine for for our
demonstration last week he's mentioning

648
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,200
demonstration last week he's mentioning
 

649
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,260
demonstration last week he's mentioning
that on his notebook on his pine Book

650
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,270
that on his notebook on his pine Book
 

651
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,690
that on his notebook on his pine Book
Pro he had to actually hold in that key

652
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:44,700
Pro he had to actually hold in that key
 

653
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,000
Pro he had to actually hold in that key
sequence for three seconds so if you're

654
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,010
sequence for three seconds so if you're
 

655
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,920
sequence for three seconds so if you're
finding that it's not having an impact

656
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,930
finding that it's not having an impact
 

657
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,050
finding that it's not having an impact
perhaps that's the difference followed

658
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,060
perhaps that's the difference followed
 

659
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,850
perhaps that's the difference followed
the same tutorial from last week on how

660
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:52,860
the same tutorial from last week on how
 

661
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,410
the same tutorial from last week on how
to get the Wi-Fi working on your new

662
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:54,420
to get the Wi-Fi working on your new
 

663
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,930
to get the Wi-Fi working on your new
pine Book Pro but try holding it in for

664
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:56,940
pine Book Pro but try holding it in for
 

665
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,300
pine Book Pro but try holding it in for
three seconds if my demonstration of

666
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,310
three seconds if my demonstration of
 

667
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,490
three seconds if my demonstration of
really quickly tapping didn't do it for

668
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:01,500
really quickly tapping didn't do it for
 

669
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,130
really quickly tapping didn't do it for
you so that's good to know as well

670
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,140
you so that's good to know as well
 

671
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,970
you so that's good to know as well
the final thing the bp9 mentions is that

672
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:06,980
the final thing the bp9 mentions is that
 

673
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,870
the final thing the bp9 mentions is that
his keyboard came preset up with the UK

674
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:11,880
his keyboard came preset up with the UK
 

675
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,640
his keyboard came preset up with the UK
keyboard layout well that could be

676
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,650
keyboard layout well that could be
 

677
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,410
keyboard layout well that could be
frustrating because your keys are not

678
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:15,420
frustrating because your keys are not
 

679
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,630
frustrating because your keys are not
gonna be in the right spot so basically

680
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:17,640
gonna be in the right spot so basically
 

681
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,750
gonna be in the right spot so basically
ISO layout versus ANSI and so you'd have

682
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:20,760
ISO layout versus ANSI and so you'd have
 

683
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,490
ISO layout versus ANSI and so you'd have
trouble entering your password and

684
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:22,500
trouble entering your password and
 

685
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,470
trouble entering your password and
things like that interestingly enough

686
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
things like that interestingly enough
 

687
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,050
things like that interestingly enough
when I booted up and fired up Manjaro

688
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,060
when I booted up and fired up Manjaro
 

689
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,690
when I booted up and fired up Manjaro
for the first time it asked me whether I

690
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:29,700
for the first time it asked me whether I
 

691
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,720
for the first time it asked me whether I
wanted ISO or ANSI so I went through

692
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:32,730
wanted ISO or ANSI so I went through
 

693
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,450
wanted ISO or ANSI so I went through
that process of telling it what keyboard

694
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:35,460
that process of telling it what keyboard
 

695
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,360
that process of telling it what keyboard
layout I had

696
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,370
layout I had
 

697
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,610
layout I had
and it worked just fine for me but in

698
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:38,620
and it worked just fine for me but in
 

699
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,640
and it worked just fine for me but in
bp9 s case that wasn't the case and he

700
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:41,650
bp9 s case that wasn't the case and he
 

701
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,470
bp9 s case that wasn't the case and he
was very quickly able to go in and just

702
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:43,480
was very quickly able to go in and just
 

703
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,440
was very quickly able to go in and just
change the keyboard settings within the

704
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,450
change the keyboard settings within the
 

705
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,440
change the keyboard settings within the
menu system found his way there says it

706
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,450
menu system found his way there says it
 

707
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,780
menu system found his way there says it
wasn't a big deal it was a simple fix

708
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:51,790
wasn't a big deal it was a simple fix
 

709
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,500
wasn't a big deal it was a simple fix
that I didn't even need the wiki for

710
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,510
that I didn't even need the wiki for
 

711
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,730
that I didn't even need the wiki for
since I knew how to change the layout

712
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:56,740
since I knew how to change the layout
 

713
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,250
since I knew how to change the layout

video would be great well here you are
 

743
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,020
video would be great well here you are
this is video so I I will do this thing

744
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,030
this is video so I I will do this thing
 

745
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,970
this is video so I I will do this thing
all right so the first thing that we

746
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:41,980
all right so the first thing that we
 

747
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,430
all right so the first thing that we
need to determine is whether we want to

748
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,440
need to determine is whether we want to
 

749
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,549
need to determine is whether we want to
use an SD card or the built-in emmc and

750
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:49,559
use an SD card or the built-in emmc and
 

751
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,750
use an SD card or the built-in emmc and
there are a couple of things that would

752
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
there are a couple of things that would
 

753
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,510
there are a couple of things that would
be kind of a deciding factor SD cards

754
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:54,520
be kind of a deciding factor SD cards
 

755
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,640
be kind of a deciding factor SD cards
are a really really easy way to be able

756
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:56,650
are a really really easy way to be able
 

757
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,660
are a really really easy way to be able
to switch back and forth between

758
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:57,670
to switch back and forth between
 

759
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,690
to switch back and forth between
multiple distros you got to kind of pop

760
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:00,700
multiple distros you got to kind of pop
 

761
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,480
multiple distros you got to kind of pop
you push in if you have one in there and

762
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,490
you push in if you have one in there and
 

763
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,120
you push in if you have one in there and
then it pops out so that's my SD card

764
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,130
then it pops out so that's my SD card
 

765
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,669
then it pops out so that's my SD card
right there I think I just ejected my OS

766
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:08,679
right there I think I just ejected my OS
 

767
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,360
right there I think I just ejected my OS
while it's on oh don't do that

768
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,370
while it's on oh don't do that
 

769
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,570
while it's on oh don't do that
that's like pulling your hard drive but

770
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:15,580
that's like pulling your hard drive but
 

771
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,240
that's like pulling your hard drive but
the built-in emmc can be a little bit

772
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,250
the built-in emmc can be a little bit
 

773
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,600
the built-in emmc can be a little bit
more challenging to to set up but think

774
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,610
more challenging to to set up but think
 

775
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,790
more challenging to to set up but think
about this one of the things and I'll

776
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:23,800
about this one of the things and I'll
 

777
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,040
about this one of the things and I'll
touch on that I'll explain that but one

778
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,050
touch on that I'll explain that but one
 

779
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,690
touch on that I'll explain that but one
of the things I like about SD cards and

780
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:27,700
of the things I like about SD cards and
 

781
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,210
of the things I like about SD cards and
the ability to boot from an SD card yeah

782

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,430
the ability to boot from an SD card yeah
sure enough I just crashed my system I'm

784
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:32,440
sure enough I just crashed my system I'm
 

785
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,880
sure enough I just crashed my system I'm
going to reboot the nice thing about

786
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:34,890
going to reboot the nice thing about
 

787
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,799
going to reboot the nice thing about
being able to boot from an SD card is

788
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:37,809
being able to boot from an SD card is
 

789
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,799
being able to boot from an SD card is
let's say you've got a household where

790
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:40,809
let's say you've got a household where
 

791
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:43,110
let's say you've got a household where
everybody shares the same devices so you

792
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
everybody shares the same devices so you
 

793
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
everybody shares the same devices so you
could give each family member for

794
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,610
could give each family member for
 

795
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,460
could give each family member for
example or maybe you're an education

796
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:47,470
example or maybe you're an education
 

797
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,180
example or maybe you're an education
facility and you want to give each dude

798
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,190
facility and you want to give each dude
 

799
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,780
facility and you want to give each dude
or each teacher their own SD card so you

800
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:52,790
or each teacher their own SD card so you
 

801
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,760
or each teacher their own SD card so you
set up the operating system on that SD

802
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,770
set up the operating system on that SD
 

803
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,760
set up the operating system on that SD
card and everyone who goes to use it

804
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:57,770
card and everyone who goes to use it
 

805
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,110
card and everyone who goes to use it
with the power off boots from their SD

806
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,120
with the power off boots from their SD
 

807
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,340
with the power off boots from their SD
card and all their applications

808
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:03,350
card and all their applications
 

809
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,610
card and all their applications
everything else is set up on a per user

810
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:06,620
everything else is set up on a per user
 

811
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,470
everything else is set up on a per user
basis and nobody affects any other user

812
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
basis and nobody affects any other user
 

813
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,450
basis and nobody affects any other user
because the SD card is in fact their

814
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:10,460
because the SD card is in fact their
 

815
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,210
because the SD card is in fact their
booting harddrive now I just proved that

816
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,220
booting harddrive now I just proved that
 

817
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,000
booting harddrive now I just proved that
doing what I just did while stupid did

818
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,010
doing what I just did while stupid did
 

819
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,960
doing what I just did while stupid did
not destroy my Pyne Book Pro operating

820
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:19,970
not destroy my Pyne Book Pro operating
 

821
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,490
not destroy my Pyne Book Pro operating
system on my SD card so that's a good

822
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:21,500
system on my SD card so that's a good
 

823
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,140
system on my SD card so that's a good
thing so that's kind of cool because

824
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,150
thing so that's kind of cool because
 

825
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,030
thing so that's kind of cool because
with your own SD card you can just boot

826
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,040
with your own SD card you can just boot
 

827
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,710
with your own SD card you can just boot
it up and have your own settings so I

828
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
it up and have your own settings so I
 

829
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,030
it up and have your own settings so I
like that

830
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,040
like that
 

831
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,860
like that
if you've settled on the distro that you

832
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:29,870
if you've settled on the distro that you
 

833
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,220
if you've settled on the distro that you
prefer it may be time to install it on

834
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,230
prefer it may be time to install it on
 

835
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,280
prefer it may be time to install it on
an emmc but it can be more involved as I

836
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,290
an emmc but it can be more involved as I
 

837
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,620
an emmc but it can be more involved as I
mentioned because it requires sometimes

838
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:38,630
mentioned because it requires sometimes
 

839
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,450
mentioned because it requires sometimes
opening the pine Book Pro and you've got

840
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:40,460
opening the pine Book Pro and you've got
 

841
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,300
opening the pine Book Pro and you've got
to use a special adapter to flash it but

842
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,310
to use a special adapter to flash it but
 

843
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,450
to use a special adapter to flash it but
the process itself is the same even in

844
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:46,460
the process itself is the same even in
 

845
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,070
the process itself is the same even in
that case so if you have the adapter

846
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
that case so if you have the adapter
 

847
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,800
that case so if you have the adapter
you're gonna burn to an emmc I use the

848
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:50,810
you're gonna burn to an emmc I use the
 

849
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,880
you're gonna burn to an emmc I use the
term burn using an adapter plugged into

850
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:54,890
term burn using an adapter plugged into
 

851
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,550
term burn using an adapter plugged into
the USB port or something like that and

852
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:57,560
the USB port or something like that and
 

853
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,260
the USB port or something like that and
it's going to be the same process you're

854
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,270
it's going to be the same process you're
 

855
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,630
it's going to be the same process you're
gonna use the same software you may have

856
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:01,640
gonna use the same software you may have
 

857
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,340
gonna use the same software you may have
to use a different image depending on

858
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,350
to use a different image depending on
 

859
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,440
to use a different image depending on
which distro you're looking at but

860
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,450
which distro you're looking at but
 

861
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,190
which distro you're looking at but
speaking of there are some distros such

862
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
speaking of there are some distros such
 

863
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,710
speaking of there are some distros such
as Manjaro that actually offer an

864
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,720
as Manjaro that actually offer an
 

865
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,170
as Manjaro that actually offer an
installer so if you burn it to an SD

866
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:14,180
installer so if you burn it to an SD
 

867
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,170
installer so if you burn it to an SD
card then you boot the pine book pro you

868
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:17,180
card then you boot the pine book pro you
 

869
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,810
card then you boot the pine book pro you
can then install it to the emmc so you

870
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:19,820
can then install it to the emmc so you
 

871
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,490
can then install it to the emmc so you
don't have to open up the pine Book Pro

872
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:21,500
don't have to open up the pine Book Pro
 

873
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,860
don't have to open up the pine Book Pro
you don't have to buy an adapter to be

874
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:23,870
you don't have to buy an adapter to be
 

875
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,920
you don't have to buy an adapter to be
able to flash any MMC card so that's

876
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:26,930
able to flash any MMC card so that's
 

877
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,540
able to flash any MMC card so that's
pretty brilliant you've got to look

878
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,550
pretty brilliant you've got to look
 

879
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,270
pretty brilliant you've got to look

893
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,240
wiki and go to pine book pro software
now I'm going to go with Manjaro because

894
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,250
now I'm going to go with Manjaro because
 

895
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,070
now I'm going to go with Manjaro because
we know that it's tried-and-true it's

896
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,080
we know that it's tried-and-true it's
 

897
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,890
we know that it's tried-and-true it's
the one that's coming on it and I've

898
00:20:59,890 --> 00:20:59,900
the one that's coming on it and I've
 

899
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,380
the one that's coming on it and I've
actually downloaded Debian on my SD card

900
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,390
actually downloaded Debian on my SD card
 

901
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,860
actually downloaded Debian on my SD card
so I'm

902
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:02,870
so I'm
 

903
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,970
so I'm
from an SD card normally so this is

904
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:06,980
from an SD card normally so this is
 

905
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,360
from an SD card normally so this is
Debian running off of the SD card we're

906
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,370
Debian running off of the SD card we're
 

907
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,890
Debian running off of the SD card we're
going to change that in a couple of

908
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:11,900
going to change that in a couple of
 

909
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,190
going to change that in a couple of
moments so next step is we need to get a

910
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
moments so next step is we need to get a
 

911
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,160
moments so next step is we need to get a
tool to do the burning we're gonna use a

912
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,170
tool to do the burning we're gonna use a
 

913
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,640
tool to do the burning we're gonna use a
tool called B'Elanna both villena both

914
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:21,650
tool called B'Elanna both villena both
 

915

collaborate with other programmers but
 

2179
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,300

essentially what it does for me is it

2180
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:11,310
essentially what it does for me is it
 

2181
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,700
essentially what it does for me is it
allows me to share my code online in

2182
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:13,710
allows me to share my code online in
 

2183
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,350
allows me to share my code online in
such a way that other people can use it

2184
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:15,360
such a way that other people can use it
 

2185
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,330
such a way that other people can use it
open source they can compile it or use

2186
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:17,340
open source they can compile it or use
 

2187
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,500
open source they can compile it or use
it or run it on their own computers and

2188
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,510
it or run it on their own computers and
 

2189
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,270
it or run it on their own computers and
then if they decide oh well I'd rather

2190
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
then if they decide oh well I'd rather
 

2191
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,370
then if they decide oh well I'd rather
it work this way or maybe here's a bug

2192
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:25,380
it work this way or maybe here's a bug
 

2193
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,350
it work this way or maybe here's a bug
and I can fix that they can do what's

2194
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:27,360
and I can fix that they can do what's
 

2195
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,960
and I can fix that they can do what's
called a pull request so basically they

2196
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:29,970
called a pull request so basically they
 

2197
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,260
called a pull request so basically they
clone my github repository my software

2198
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:33,270
clone my github repository my software
 

2199
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,110
clone my github repository my software
code they fix it on their computer and

2200
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:36,120
code they fix it on their computer and
 

2201
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,720
code they fix it on their computer and
then they do a pull request which pushes

2202
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:38,730
then they do a pull request which pushes
 

2203
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,090
then they do a pull request which pushes
it back while they push it back to their

2204
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:41,100
it back while they push it back to their
 

2205
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,940
it back while they push it back to their
fork and then it creates a pull request

2206
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:43,950
fork and then it creates a pull request
 

2207
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,360
fork and then it creates a pull request
for me so that I see that Hey Joe will

2208
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,370
for me so that I see that Hey Joe will
 

2209
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,580
for me so that I see that Hey Joe will
blow over their fix this bug with my

2210
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:49,590
blow over their fix this bug with my
 

2211
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,800
blow over their fix this bug with my
software I can click a button and it

2212
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:51,810
software I can click a button and it
 

2213
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,590
software I can click a button and it
will import that fix into my software so

2214
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:54,600
will import that fix into my software so
 

2215
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,350
will import that fix into my software so
there's a whole lot to it and it's

2216
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:57,360
there's a whole lot to it and it's
 

2217
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,730
there's a whole lot to it and it's
really it's very powerful it can be

2218
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:01,740
really it's very powerful it can be
 

2219
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,290
really it's very powerful it can be
confusing especially when you get into

2220
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:03,300
confusing especially when you get into
 

2221
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,390
confusing especially when you get into
squashing and merging them and those

2222
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:05,400
squashing and merging them and those
 

2223
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,740
squashing and merging them and those
kinds of things which we're not gonna

2224
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:06,750
kinds of things which we're not gonna
 

2225
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,260
kinds of things which we're not gonna
get into today but what I do want to

2226
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,270
get into today but what I do want to
 

2227
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,600
get into today but what I do want to
show you is how the very most basic

2228
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:11,610
show you is how the very most basic
 

2229
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,990
show you is how the very most basic
knowledge about how it works is going to

2230
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:15,000
knowledge about how it works is going to
 

2231
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,540
knowledge about how it works is going to
allow you to use github in an effective

2232
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:17,550
allow you to use github in an effective
 

2233
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,590
allow you to use github in an effective
manner think of it as that where you're

2234
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:21,600
manner think of it as that where you're
 

2235
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,200
manner think of it as that where you're
putting your code out there as open

2236
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,210
putting your code out there as open
 

2237
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,240
putting your code out there as open
source software and it doesn't have to

2238
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,250
source software and it doesn't have to
 

2239
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,610
source software and it doesn't have to
be you can have it private if you want

2240
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:28,620
be you can have it private if you want
 

2241
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,280
be you can have it private if you want
but in my case that's what I'm doing I

2242
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:31,290
but in my case that's what I'm doing I
 

2243
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,810
but in my case that's what I'm doing I
want people to collaborate with me

2244
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:32,820
want people to collaborate with me
 

2245
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,970
want people to collaborate with me
occasionally maybe they'll post issues

2246
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:34,980
occasionally maybe they'll post issues
 

2247
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,980
occasionally maybe they'll post issues
if they find a bug and then I'm still

2248
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:36,990
if they find a bug and then I'm still
 

2249
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,270
if they find a bug and then I'm still
the person who has to fix it but at

2250
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:38,280
the person who has to fix it but at
 

2251
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,520
the person who has to fix it but at
least my community is coming into my

2252
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:40,530
least my community is coming into my
 

2253
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,460
least my community is coming into my
software repository and saying this is a

2254
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:43,470
software repository and saying this is a
 

2255
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:46,570
software repository and saying this is a
problem and you need to fix it

how this works so you can see that I've
 

2283
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,370
how this works so you can see that I've
got a ton of software repositories and

2284
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:30,380
got a ton of software repositories and
 

2285
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,660
got a ton of software repositories and
they're all different projects all

2286
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:31,670
they're all different projects all
 

2287
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,970
they're all different projects all
different things that I've done or that

2288
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:33,980
different things that I've done or that
 

2289
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,400
different things that I've done or that
I am continuing to do and there's pages

2290
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:36,410
I am continuing to do and there's pages
 

2291
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,820
I am continuing to do and there's pages
and pages and pages of it so once you

2292
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:39,830
and pages and pages of it so once you
 

2293
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,450
and pages and pages of it so once you
have your github account you can log in

2294
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:43,460
have your github account you can log in
 

2295
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,910
have your github account you can log in
to what you see here which is my

2296
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
to what you see here which is my
 

2297
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,650
to what you see here which is my
repositories list but when you first

2298
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:47,660
repositories list but when you first
 

2299
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,970
repositories list but when you first
sign up you're not going to have all of

2300
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:48,980
sign up you're not going to have all of
 

2301
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,370
sign up you're not going to have all of
these you need to create your first

2302
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:51,380
these you need to create your first
 

2303
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,530
these you need to create your first
repository so the way that I'm going to

2304
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:53,540
repository so the way that I'm going to
 

2305
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,230
repository so the way that I'm going to
do that now understand github is not

2306
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
do that now understand github is not
 

2307
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,350
do that now understand github is not
required forget ok and git is not the

2308
00:51:59,350 --> 00:51:59,360
required forget ok and git is not the
 

2309
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,720
required forget ok and git is not the
same as github github is an online

2310
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:01,730
same as github github is an online
 

2311
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,870
same as github github is an online
service and think of it as cloud storage

2312
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:04,880
service and think of it as cloud storage
 

2313
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,980
service and think of it as cloud storage
forget ok it is not the same thing it is

2314
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:08,990
forget ok it is not the same thing it is
 

2315
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,130
forget ok it is not the same thing it is
a online storage for that open-source

2316
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:12,140
a online storage for that open-source
 

2317
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,530
a online storage for that open-source
package management tool or a project

2318
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:14,540
package management tool or a project
 

2319
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,830
package management tool or a project
management tool so here on github

2320
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:17,840
management tool so here on github
 

2321
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,450
management tool so here on github
they've made it really really easy to

2322
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,460
they've made it really really easy to
 

2323
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,090
they've made it really really easy to
simply say new repository so I've gone

2324
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:22,100
simply say new repository so I've gone
 

2325
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,650
simply say new repository so I've gone
to my repositories and I've clicked on

2326
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:23,660
to my repositories and I've clicked on
 

2327
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,440
to my repositories and I've clicked on
new and then I'm going to give it a name

2328
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,450
new and then I'm going to give it a name
 

2329
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,320
new and then I'm going to give it a name
I'm going to call this one my underscore

2330
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,330
I'm going to call this one my underscore
 

2331
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,010
I'm going to call this one my underscore
test and a an optional description this

2332
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:33,020
test and a an optional description this
 

2333
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,580

is a test for the show whether you want

2334
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:36,590
is a test for the show whether you want
 

2335
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,240
is a test for the show whether you want
it to be public or private and then

2336
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,250
it to be public or private and then
 

2337
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,530
it to be public or private and then
initialize it with a readme it's always

2338
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:41,540
initialize it with a readme it's always
 

2339
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,020
initialize it with a readme it's always
best to do that it's it makes it so that

get pull again I'm doing this all within
 

2629
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,130
get pull again I'm doing this all within
the my underscore test folder so git

2630
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:24,140
the my underscore test folder so git
 

2631
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,560
the my underscore test folder so git
pull is going to then look for any

2632
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:26,570
pull is going to then look for any
 

2633
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,420

and pull them down to my computer so
 

2637
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,860
and pull them down to my computer so
it's always synchronizing those changes

2638
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:32,870
it's always synchronizing those changes
 

2639
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,320
it's always synchronizing those changes
so now if I open Nano and open that file

2640
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:35,330
so now if I open Nano and open that file
 

2641
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,550
so now if I open Nano and open that file
you can see that new

2642
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:36,560

you go to the repository you click on
 

2697
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,100
you go to the repository you click on
the button called fork and it basically

2698
01:00:59,100 --> 01:00:59,110
the button called fork and it basically

that you can make changes to and then
 

2703
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,410
that you can make changes to and then
that's where you can do pull requests

2704
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:05,420
that's where you can do pull requests
