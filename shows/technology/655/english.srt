00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,430
the SOC Wi-Fi chip everything else so
we're familiar with that I don't need to

312
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,440
we're familiar with that I don't need to
 

313
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,310
we're familiar with that I don't need to
get into too many details the argon 1 PI

314
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:01,320
get into too many details the argon 1 PI
 

315
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,470
get into too many details the argon 1 PI
4 case however and I should mention they

316
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:03,480
4 case however and I should mention they
 

317
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,430
4 case however and I should mention they
do sell a PI 3 compatible argon one so

318
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
do sell a PI 3 compatible argon one so
 

319
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,410
do sell a PI 3 compatible argon one so
keep that in mind however you can't

320
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:09,420
keep that in mind however you can't
 

321
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,860
keep that in mind however you can't
intermix so if you're using an PI 4 you

322
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:12,870
intermix so if you're using an PI 4 you
 

323
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,870
intermix so if you're using an PI 4 you
have to get the PI 4 model if you're

324
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:14,880
have to get the PI 4 model if you're
 

325
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,870
have to get the PI 4 model if you're
using a PI 3 make sure you get the PI 3

326
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:17,880
using a PI 3 make sure you get the PI 3
 

327
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,000
using a PI 3 make sure you get the PI 3
model in our case we're going big or

Raspberry Pi or any single board
 

371
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,469
Raspberry Pi or any single board
computer for the most part is that

372
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:47,479
computer for the most part is that
 

373
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,289
computer for the most part is that
you've got these connectors all around

374
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:50,299
you've got these connectors all around
 

375
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,179
you've got these connectors all around
the board so it's really hard to make it

376
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:52,189
the board so it's really hard to make it
 

377
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,439
the board so it's really hard to make it
look nice on a shelf

378
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:53,449
look nice on a shelf
 

379
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,149
look nice on a shelf
you've got the ethernet coming out one

380
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:55,159
you've got the ethernet coming out one
 

381
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,039
you've got the ethernet coming out one
side you got HDMI coming out the other

382
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,049
side you got HDMI coming out the other
 

383
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,929
side you got HDMI coming out the other
and power coming out here and video

384
00:09:58,929 --> 00:09:58,939
and power coming out here and video

coming out here and Jeep and all that
 

387
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:02,439
coming out here and Jeep and all that
kind of stuff so what they've done is

388
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:02,449
kind of stuff so what they've done is
 

389
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:05,919
kind of stuff so what they've done is
they've provided a basically an adapter

390
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:05,929
they've provided a basically an adapter
 

391
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:08,439
they've provided a basically an adapter
that is going to simply plug in to the

392
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:08,449
that is going to simply plug in to the
 

393
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,869
that is going to simply plug in to the
board to the headphone jack and the dual

394
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:10,879
board to the headphone jack and the dual
 

395
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,289
board to the headphone jack and the dual
HDMI output and what does it do it puts

396
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:14,299
HDMI output and what does it do it puts
 

397
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,799
HDMI output and what does it do it puts
all of those jacks directly onto the

398
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:17,809
all of those jacks directly onto the
 

399
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:21,159
all of those jacks directly onto the
back of the Raspberry Pi so I'm just

400
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,169
back of the Raspberry Pi so I'm just
 

401
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,109
back of the Raspberry Pi so I'm just
given that a nice snug little push I'm

402
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:23,119
given that a nice snug little push I'm
 

403
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:26,279
given that a nice snug little push I'm
being careful I'm actually holding the

404
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:26,289
being careful I'm actually holding the
 

405
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,079
being careful I'm actually holding the
the points on the board that I'm pushing

406
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:29,089
the points on the board that I'm pushing
 

407
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,999
the points on the board that I'm pushing
so I don't accidentally break that off

408
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:31,009
so I don't accidentally break that off
 

409
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,210
so I don't accidentally break that off
break the solder joints for that I don't

410
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:34,220
break the solder joints for that I don't
 

411
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,469
break the solder joints for that I don't
know that it would happen but I want to

412
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:35,479
know that it would happen but I want to
 

413
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:37,599
know that it would happen but I want to
be careful so there you have it so this

414
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:37,609
be careful so there you have it so this
 

415
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,519
be careful so there you have it so this
is going to put the audio and the dual

416
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:39,529
is going to put the audio and the dual
 

417
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,589
is going to put the audio and the dual
HDMI at the back along with USB USB 3

418
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:44,599
HDMI at the back along with USB USB 3
 

419
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:49,269
HDMI at the back along with USB USB 3
and Gigabit Ethernet further into the

420
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
and Gigabit Ethernet further into the
 

421
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,369
and Gigabit Ethernet further into the
box okay we've got some thermal pads

422
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:51,379
box okay we've got some thermal pads
 

423
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,539
box okay we've got some thermal pads
we're going to need those to make

424
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:52,549
we're going to need those to make
 

425
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,929
we're going to need those to make
thermal contact with the SOC and the the

426
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:55,939
thermal contact with the SOC and the the
 

427
00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:00,189
thermal contact with the SOC and the the
RAM and here is the interior of the

428
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:00,199
RAM and here is the interior of the
 

429
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:04,119
RAM and here is the interior of the
argon one case for the Raspberry Pi 4 so

430
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:04,129
argon one case for the Raspberry Pi 4 so
 

431
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,109
argon one case for the Raspberry Pi 4 so
we can see a fan controller with GPIO

432
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:07,119
we can see a fan controller with GPIO
 

433
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,319
we can see a fan controller with GPIO
GPIO

434
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:08,329
GPIO
 

435
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,189
GPIO
riser pins so the Raspberry Pi 4 is

436
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:12,199
riser pins so the Raspberry Pi 4 is
 

437
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,649
riser pins so the Raspberry Pi 4 is
going to connect with the GPIO

438
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:14,659
going to connect with the GPIO
 

439
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,710
going to connect with the GPIO
so it's actually this is really really

440
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:17,720
so it's actually this is really really
 

441
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,960
so it's actually this is really really
cool if I can show you internally so

442
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:19,970
cool if I can show you internally so
 

443
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,379
cool if I can show you internally so
you're not losing the GPIO what it

444
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:23,389
you're not losing the GPIO what it
 

445
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,149
you're not losing the GPIO what it
actually does is under this magnetic

446
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:25,159
actually does is under this magnetic
 

447
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,789
actually does is under this magnetic
hood here if I can just get that off

448
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:27,799
hood here if I can just get that off
 

449
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,409
hood here if I can just get that off
there we go it has the GPIO risen out

450
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:32,419
there we go it has the GPIO risen out
 

451
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,449
there we go it has the GPIO risen out
from the board so here's where the

452
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:34,459
from the board so here's where the
 

453
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,299
from the board so here's where the
actual GPIO is and it displaces it over

454
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:37,309
actual GPIO is and it displaces it over
 

455
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,550
actual GPIO is and it displaces it over
here with a nice edge

456
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:39,560
here with a nice edge
 

457
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,700
here with a nice edge
GPIO header identifier so you don't have

458
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:42,710
GPIO header identifier so you don't have
 

459
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,860
GPIO header identifier so you don't have
to look for that card how cool is that

460
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:44,870
to look for that card how cool is that
 

461
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,600
to look for that card how cool is that
so if you want to get into maker tech

462
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:46,610
so if you want to get into maker tech
 

463
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,030
so if you want to get into maker tech
while this is looking so beautiful you

464
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
while this is looking so beautiful you
 

465
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,100
while this is looking so beautiful you
can easily remove this magnetic cover

466
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,110
can easily remove this magnetic cover
 

467
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:56,050
can easily remove this magnetic cover
and access the GPIO alright so let's get

468
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,060
and access the GPIO alright so let's get
 

469
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,640
and access the GPIO alright so let's get
this thing assembled and put together so

470
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:57,650
this thing assembled and put together so
 

471
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:03,640
this thing assembled and put together so
we can fire it up now I mentioned that

472
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:03,650
we can fire it up now I mentioned that
 

473
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,640
we can fire it up now I mentioned that
this is both active and passive cooling

474
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:06,650
this is both active and passive cooling
 

475
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,240
this is both active and passive cooling
so keep in mind while this is a plastic

476
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,250
so keep in mind while this is a plastic
 

477
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,370
so keep in mind while this is a plastic
base for the for the argon one this is

478
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:15,380
base for the for the argon one this is
 

479
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,519
base for the for the argon one this is
an aluminum cover okay so this is for

480
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:18,529
an aluminum cover okay so this is for
 

481
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,680
an aluminum cover okay so this is for
heat dissipation the aluminum actually

482
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:20,690
heat dissipation the aluminum actually
 

483
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,780
heat dissipation the aluminum actually
kind of pulls the heat away from the SOC

484
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:22,790
kind of pulls the heat away from the SOC
 

485
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,870
kind of pulls the heat away from the SOC
and these are the two contacts so we've

486
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:25,880
and these are the two contacts so we've
 

487
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,110
and these are the two contacts so we've
got one for the the SOC itself and one

488
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
got one for the the SOC itself and one
 

489
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,970
got one for the the SOC itself and one
for the RAM and then we've got the

490
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:30,980
for the RAM and then we've got the
 

491
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,660
for the RAM and then we've got the
active cooler so if it still gets too

492
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:34,670
active cooler so if it still gets too
 

493
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,110
active cooler so if it still gets too
hot even though it is dissipating the

494
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,120
hot even though it is dissipating the
 

495
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,300
hot even though it is dissipating the
heat through the aluminum then the fan

496
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,310
heat through the aluminum then the fan
 

497
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,300
heat through the aluminum then the fan
which is on a fan controller will spin

498
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,310
which is on a fan controller will spin
 

499
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,020
which is on a fan controller will spin
up to designated speeds that you specify

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,950
Raspberry Pi where there is no standoff
so you're not screwing into that and

624
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:19,960
so you're not screwing into that and
 

625
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,560
so you're not screwing into that and
we're leaving these four outer ones for

626
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:22,570
we're leaving these four outer ones for
 

627
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,540
we're leaving these four outer ones for
the bottom of the case so now I'm just

628
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:24,550
the bottom of the case so now I'm just
 

629
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,120
the bottom of the case so now I'm just
gonna put that on top and grab the four

630
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,130
gonna put that on top and grab the four
 

631
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,670
gonna put that on top and grab the four
longer screws and we're gonna put those

632
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
longer screws and we're gonna put those
 

633
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:44,670
longer screws and we're gonna put those
ones in there we have it congratulations

634
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:44,680
ones in there we have it congratulations
 

635
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,280
ones in there we have it congratulations
you did it you did it it wasn't that

636
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,290
you did it you did it it wasn't that
 

637
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,150
you did it you did it it wasn't that
hard was it

638
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
hard was it
 

639
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,210
hard was it
check out the ports on the back I love

640
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,220
check out the ports on the back I love
 

641
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,640
check out the ports on the back I love
how sleek that looks notice there's no

00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,420
we do have an SD micro SD port at the
 

647
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,540
we do have an SD micro SD port at the
front kind of hidden away on the bottom

651
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,020
however all of the i/o has been moved to
the back I love that plus we've got this

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,030
the back I love that plus we've got this
 

653
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,890
the back I love that plus we've got this
power button and it's just absolutely

657
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,270
sleep we do have to take a quick break
when we return I'm gonna fire this up

658
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
when we return I'm gonna fire this up
 

659
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,370
when we return I'm gonna fire this up
and together we're gonna check out the

660
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:17,380
and together we're gonna check out the
 

661
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,670
and together we're gonna check out the
features of the argon one case with the

during the break I grabbed my micro SD

670
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:46,630
during the break I grabbed my micro SD
 

671
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,000
during the break I grabbed my micro SD
card with the latest version of a

Raspberry Pi OS on it I wanted to say

674
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:50,680
Raspberry Pi OS on it I wanted to say
 

675
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,350
Raspberry Pi OS on it I wanted to say
raspbian but they've changed the name so

676
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,360
raspbian but they've changed the name so
 

677
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,450
raspbian but they've changed the name so
it's called Raspberry Pi os now I

678
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:54,460
it's called Raspberry Pi os now I
 

679
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,420
it's called Raspberry Pi os now I
tracked down my 5 volt 3.5 amp power

680
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:57,430
tracked down my 5 volt 3.5 amp power
 

681
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,700
tracked down my 5 volt 3.5 amp power
supply and just keep in mind the

682
00:17:59,700 --> 00:17:59,710
supply and just keep in mind the
 

683
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,490

Raspberry Pi 4 is a power-hungry beast

684
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:02,500
Raspberry Pi 4 is a power-hungry beast
 

685
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,490
Raspberry Pi 4 is a power-hungry beast
so while I could probably power it with

686
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:05,500
so while I could probably power it with
 

687
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,800
so while I could probably power it with
my 3 amp power supply or potentially

688
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:07,810
my 3 amp power supply or potentially
 

689
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,270

even something a little bit less you

even something a little bit less you

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,850
even something a little bit less you
could damage your SD card if there isn't

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:11,860
could damage your SD card if there isn't
 

693
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,250
could damage your SD card if there isn't
enough power and that's surprisingly

694
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,260
enough power and that's surprisingly
 

695
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,830
enough power and that's surprisingly
easy to do let's say I willy-nilly plug

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:16,840
easy to do let's say I willy-nilly plug
 

697
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,900
easy to do let's say I willy-nilly plug
in a USB device that draws an amp or

in a USB device that draws an amp or

in a USB device that draws an amp or
something from the USB port well there

you go so I prefer to err on the side of

00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
you go so I prefer to err on the side of
 

703
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,030
you go so I prefer to err on the side of
caution so using a 3.5 amp power supply

704
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,040
caution so using a 3.5 amp power supply
 

705
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,280
caution so using a 3.5 amp power supply
is just playing it safe that'll ensure

706
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,290
is just playing it safe that'll ensure
 

707
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,230
is just playing it safe that'll ensure
that I get the best reliability out of

708
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,240
that I get the best reliability out of
 

709
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,170
that I get the best reliability out of
my Raspberry Pi 4 alright with all the

710
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:34,180
my Raspberry Pi 4 alright with all the
 

711
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,210
my Raspberry Pi 4 alright with all the
cables connected I'm going to fire up

712
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:36,220
cables connected I'm going to fire up
 

713
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,940
cables connected I'm going to fire up
the Raspberry Pi 4 with a single press

714
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:38,950
the Raspberry Pi 4 with a single press
 

715
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,360
the Raspberry Pi 4 with a single press
on the power button on the Aragon one

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,370
on the power button on the Aragon one
 

717
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,150
on the power button on the Aragon one
and I can hear just a little spin of a

718
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,160
and I can hear just a little spin of a
 

719
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,910
and I can hear just a little spin of a
fan I don't even think you'll be able to

720
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:47,920
fan I don't even think you'll be able to
 

721
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,290
fan I don't even think you'll be able to
hear that with our compressors and

722
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:49,300
hear that with our compressors and
 

723
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,420
hear that with our compressors and
everything else but it's just a slight I

724
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,430
everything else but it's just a slight I
 

725
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,340
everything else but it's just a slight I
can tell that the fan has turned on and

726
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,350
can tell that the fan has turned on and
 

727
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,230
can tell that the fan has turned on and
it's off and I am booted into my distro

728
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,240
it's off and I am booted into my distro
 

729
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,970
it's off and I am booted into my distro
man that is great ok one thing I'm just

730
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:02,980
man that is great ok one thing I'm just
 

731
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,820
man that is great ok one thing I'm just
gonna mention right out the gate because

732
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:05,830
gonna mention right out the gate because
 

733
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:11,960
gonna mention right out the gate because
running cool feels good powered up great

734
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:11,970

 

735
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,030

there's one thing that I think are gone

736
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,040
there's one thing that I think are gone
 

737
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,330
there's one thing that I think are gone
one potentially misses the boat on and

738
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,340
one potentially misses the boat on and
 

739
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,160
one potentially misses the boat on and
that's that we're still using the micro

740
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,170
that's that we're still using the micro
 

741
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,220
that's that we're still using the micro
HDMI okay so I'm still having to use a

742
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,230
HDMI okay so I'm still having to use a
 

743
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,560
HDMI okay so I'm still having to use a
micro HDMI to HDMI cable in order to

744
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,570
micro HDMI to HDMI cable in order to
 

745
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,510
micro HDMI to HDMI cable in order to
plug this into my TV and into the

746
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
plug this into my TV and into the
 

747
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,980
plug this into my TV and into the
capture devices so that you can see it

748
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:28,990
capture devices so that you can see it
 

749
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,139
capture devices so that you can see it
at home

750
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:30,149
at home
 

751
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,619
at home
however now while I feel like a bee they

752
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:33,629
however now while I feel like a bee they
 

753
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:34,639
however now while I feel like a bee they
missed the boat on that they could have

754
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:34,649
missed the boat on that they could have
 

755
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,409
missed the boat on that they could have
made it full HDMI they've got room for

756
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:36,419
made it full HDMI they've got room for
 

757
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,749
made it full HDMI they've got room for
it they could have done that and besides

758
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:38,759
it they could have done that and besides
 

759
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,549
it they could have done that and besides
they're in control of what they put on

760
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
they're in control of what they put on
 

761
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,039
they're in control of what they put on
the case however as I move this around

762
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,049
the case however as I move this around
 

763
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,419
the case however as I move this around
it's not janky at all

764
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:47,429
it's not janky at all
 

765
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,139
it's not janky at all
there's no disconnection on the HDMI and

766
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:51,149
there's no disconnection on the HDMI and
 

767
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,029
there's no disconnection on the HDMI and
I don't know about you but when I plug

768
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
I don't know about you but when I plug
 

769
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,479
I don't know about you but when I plug
my Raspberry Pi board directly into an

my Raspberry Pi board directly into an
 

771
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,429
my Raspberry Pi board directly into an
HDMI cable just like I've done with the

772
00:19:58,429 --> 00:19:58,439
HDMI cable just like I've done with the
 

773
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:01,489
HDMI cable just like I've done with the
argon one if I move it ever so slightly

774
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:01,499
argon one if I move it ever so slightly
 

775
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,489
argon one if I move it ever so slightly
the screen goes green or it goes kind of

776
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:04,499
the screen goes green or it goes kind of
 

777
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,799
the screen goes green or it goes kind of
digitally distorted or something and so

778
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:06,809
digitally distorted or something and so
 

779
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,239
digitally distorted or something and so
I've got to jiggle that cable again and

780
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:08,249
I've got to jiggle that cable again and
 

781
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,069
I've got to jiggle that cable again and
then if it ever gets moved I lose that

782
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:10,079
then if it ever gets moved I lose that
 

783
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,469
then if it ever gets moved I lose that
connectivity and it causes problems well

784
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:12,479
connectivity and it causes problems well
 

785
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,589
connectivity and it causes problems well
the argon one seems like even though

786
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:15,599
the argon one seems like even though
 

787
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,809
the argon one seems like even though
it's still micro HDMI which mmm it's not

788
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:20,819
it's still micro HDMI which mmm it's not
 

789
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,239
it's still micro HDMI which mmm it's not
the perfect connection for this kind of

790
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:23,249
the perfect connection for this kind of
 

791
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:26,029
the perfect connection for this kind of
thing even though it is still micro HDMI

792
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,039
thing even though it is still micro HDMI
 

793
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,539
thing even though it is still micro HDMI
it is significantly more solid than the

794
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:29,549
it is significantly more solid than the
 

795
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,759
it is significantly more solid than the
micro HDMI that's built into the

796
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:31,769
micro HDMI that's built into the
 

797
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:33,789
micro HDMI that's built into the
Raspberry Pi and I noticed that

798
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:33,799
Raspberry Pi and I noticed that
 

799
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,799
Raspberry Pi and I noticed that
immediately so I think you will

800
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:36,809
immediately so I think you will
 

801
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,499
immediately so I think you will
appreciate that as I mentioned I'm using

802
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:39,509
appreciate that as I mentioned I'm using
 

803
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:42,499
appreciate that as I mentioned I'm using
an HD micro HDMI to HDMI cable you can

804
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:42,509
an HD micro HDMI to HDMI cable you can
 

805
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,979
an HD micro HDMI to HDMI cable you can
also use a micro HDMI to full-sized HDMI

806
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:45,989
also use a micro HDMI to full-sized HDMI
 

807
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:48,649
also use a micro HDMI to full-sized HDMI
adapter if you like and the argon one

808
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:48,659
adapter if you like and the argon one
 

809
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:51,379
adapter if you like and the argon one
case is definitely giving me a better

810
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:51,389
case is definitely giving me a better
 

811
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:56,899
case is definitely giving me a better
connection to that HDMI output alright I

812
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:56,909
connection to that HDMI output alright I
 

813
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:00,069
connection to that HDMI output alright I
got a plug in a keyboard

814
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:00,079

 

815
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,049

I've already plugged in my USB wireless

816
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:03,059
I've already plugged in my USB wireless
 

817
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,309
I've already plugged in my USB wireless
mouse I've got my keyboard here and I'm

818
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:07,319
mouse I've got my keyboard here and I'm
 

819
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,779
mouse I've got my keyboard here and I'm
just gonna plug that into the USB 2

820
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:08,789
just gonna plug that into the USB 2
 

821
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,579
just gonna plug that into the USB 2
because I'm gonna save those USB 3s for

822
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:10,589
because I'm gonna save those USB 3s for
 

823
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:15,519
because I'm gonna save those USB 3s for
something else there we go alright so

824
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:15,529
something else there we go alright so
 

825
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,199
something else there we go alright so
the firt Oh a little bit of latency

826
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:18,209
the firt Oh a little bit of latency
 

827
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,379
the firt Oh a little bit of latency
there the first thing that I want to

828
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:21,389
there the first thing that I want to
 

829
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:23,809
there the first thing that I want to
consider is I want to I mentioned that

830
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:23,819
consider is I want to I mentioned that
 

831
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,599
consider is I want to I mentioned that
this is that this is a smart power

832
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:26,609
this is that this is a smart power
 

833
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,819
this is that this is a smart power
switch so the power switch is

834
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:28,829
switch so the power switch is
 

835
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,759
switch so the power switch is
programmable the heat dissipation the

836
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:31,769
programmable the heat dissipation the
 

837
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:35,769
programmable the heat dissipation the
active heat cooler is actually

838
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:35,779
active heat cooler is actually
 

839
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:38,599
active heat cooler is actually
programmable and I'm starting to feel a

840
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:38,609
programmable and I'm starting to feel a
 

841
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,669
programmable and I'm starting to feel a
little bit of warmth there this is

842
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:40,679
little bit of warmth there this is
 

843
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:41,929
little bit of warmth there this is
what's making me think of that cooling

844
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:41,939
what's making me think of that cooling
 

845
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:42,790
what's making me think of that cooling
system

846
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:42,800
system
 

847
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,710
system
so you can see there's vents at the side

848
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
so you can see there's vents at the side
 

849
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,570
so you can see there's vents at the side
and this is doing a really good job of

850
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:46,580
and this is doing a really good job of
 

851
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,690
and this is doing a really good job of
cooling the Raspberry Pi for however it

852
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:49,700
cooling the Raspberry Pi for however it
 

853
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,130
cooling the Raspberry Pi for however it
is starting to get warm and I want that

854
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,140
is starting to get warm and I want that
 

855
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,020
is starting to get warm and I want that
fan to come on if it starts to get a

856
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,030
fan to come on if it starts to get a
 

857
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,040
fan to come on if it starts to get a
little bit too warm so it has that

858
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,050
little bit too warm so it has that
 

859
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,050
little bit too warm so it has that
passive cooling from the aluminum and it

860
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,060
passive cooling from the aluminum and it
 

861
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,090
passive cooling from the aluminum and it
has an active cooling system the fan

862
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,100
has an active cooling system the fan
 

863
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,880
has an active cooling system the fan
that will turn on as needed so let's get

864
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:03,890
that will turn on as needed so let's get
 

865
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,610
that will turn on as needed so let's get
into our terminal and I need to become

866
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:06,620
into our terminal and I need to become
 

867
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,100
into our terminal and I need to become
root so I'm just gonna type sudo su -

868
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,110
root so I'm just gonna type sudo su -
 

869
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,230
root so I'm just gonna type sudo su -
and there boom I am root so I am root

870
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
and there boom I am root so I am root
 

871
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,140
and there boom I am root so I am root
you see the instructions that say to go

872
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,150
you see the instructions that say to go
 

873
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,300
you see the instructions that say to go
curl and then the URL HTTP colon slash

874
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,310
curl and then the URL HTTP colon slash
 

875
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:28,840
curl and then the URL HTTP colon slash
slash download dot argon-40 comm / argon

876
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:28,850
slash download dot argon-40 comm / argon
 

877
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,580
slash download dot argon-40 comm / argon
and then it's one the number one SH and

878
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:33,590
and then it's one the number one SH and
 

879
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:41,020
and then it's one the number one SH and
then a pipe why can't I think of the

880
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,030
then a pipe why can't I think of the
 

881
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,840
then a pipe why can't I think of the
word bash okay so I want to break down

882
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:43,850
word bash okay so I want to break down
 

883
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,580
word bash okay so I want to break down
that command for you okay what I'm

884
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:45,590
that command for you okay what I'm
 

885
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,870
that command for you okay what I'm
actually doing is I'm telling it to use

886
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
actually doing is I'm telling it to use
 

887
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,190
actually doing is I'm telling it to use
curl to download basically to the output

888
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
curl to download basically to the output
 

889
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
curl to download basically to the output
this script from download argon-40 comm

890
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,370
this script from download argon-40 comm
 

891
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,040
this script from download argon-40 comm
/ argon one dot sh but instead of

892
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,050
/ argon one dot sh but instead of
 

893
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,960
/ argon one dot sh but instead of
outputting it to my screen which is what

894
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:01,970
outputting it to my screen which is what
 

895
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,470
outputting it to my screen which is what
would happen if I remove the pipe bash

896
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
would happen if I remove the pipe bash
 

897
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,450
would happen if I remove the pipe bash
see that that's the script so the pipe

898
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:07,460
see that that's the script so the pipe
 

899
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,590
see that that's the script so the pipe
bash says let's actually run that script

900
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
bash says let's actually run that script
 

901
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,350
bash says let's actually run that script
in bash it's piping that output into

902
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:14,360
in bash it's piping that output into
 

903
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,580
in bash it's piping that output into
bash so if I wanted to take a different

904
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:18,590
bash so if I wanted to take a different
 

905
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,910
bash so if I wanted to take a different
approach and say I want to control what

906
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:21,920
approach and say I want to control what
 

907
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,380
approach and say I want to control what
this is actually doing or I want to

908
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:23,390
this is actually doing or I want to
 

909
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,110
this is actually doing or I want to
modify this installer the scripts before

910
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,120
modify this installer the scripts before
 

911
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,420
modify this installer the scripts before
I actually install it well let's take a

912
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,430
I actually install it well let's take a
 

913
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,660
I actually install it well let's take a
different approach so instead I'm going

914
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:31,670
different approach so instead I'm going
 

915
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:38,590
different approach so instead I'm going
to W get that or I could have piped the

916
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:38,600
to W get that or I could have piped the
 

917
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,050
to W get that or I could have piped the
curl so I'm gonna double you get o and

918
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,060
curl so I'm gonna double you get o and
 

919
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,340
curl so I'm gonna double you get o and
it's kind of monkeyed with my terminal

920
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,350
it's kind of monkeyed with my terminal
 

921
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,170
it's kind of monkeyed with my terminal
window there I'm going to ctrl C so that

922
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:44,180
window there I'm going to ctrl C so that
 

923
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,330
window there I'm going to ctrl C so that
you can see that a little better

924
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:45,340
you can see that a little better
 

925
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,910
you can see that a little better
W get oh there we go

926
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:48,920
W get oh there we go
 

927
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,520
W get oh there we go
so W get is another download tool but

928
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:51,530
so W get is another download tool but
 

929
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,720
so W get is another download tool but
this one is going to actually save the

930
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:52,730
this one is going to actually save the
 

931
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,050
this one is going to actually save the
file to argon one SH now it's grabbing

932
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,060
file to argon one SH now it's grabbing
 

933
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,470
file to argon one SH now it's grabbing
the

934
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:56,480
the
 

935
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,230
the
I've got it and all I have to do in

936
00:23:59,230 --> 00:23:59,240
I've got it and all I have to do in
 

937
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,419
I've got it and all I have to do in
order to edit that file is I can use

938
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:01,429
order to edit that file is I can use
 

939
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,230
order to edit that file is I can use
Nano for example so nano argon one dot

940
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,240
Nano for example so nano argon one dot
 

941
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,690
Nano for example so nano argon one dot
Sh it's gonna bring it up into my

942
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:07,700
Sh it's gonna bring it up into my
 

943
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,360
Sh it's gonna bring it up into my
favorite text editor alright so first

944
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,370
favorite text editor alright so first
 

945
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,010
favorite text editor alright so first
thing that I see and I should say that

946
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,020
thing that I see and I should say that
 

947
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,480
thing that I see and I should say that
one of the nice things about doing it

948
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,490
one of the nice things about doing it
 

949
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,950
one of the nice things about doing it
this way is that you can inspect the

950
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
this way is that you can inspect the
 

951
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,140
this way is that you can inspect the
code it's this is one of the things

952
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,150
code it's this is one of the things
 

953
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,909
code it's this is one of the things
about open source and the way the Linux

954
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:18,919
about open source and the way the Linux
 

955
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,860
about open source and the way the Linux
works is you can look through and see if

956
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:20,870
works is you can look through and see if
 

957
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,000
works is you can look through and see if
there's anything that you want to change

958
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,010
there's anything that you want to change
 

959
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,280
there's anything that you want to change
or whatever you want to do but so first

960
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,290
or whatever you want to do but so first
 

961
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,080
or whatever you want to do but so first
of all I see a couple of functions just

962
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,090
of all I see a couple of functions just
 

963
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,120
of all I see a couple of functions just
basically so that they can reuse some of

964
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,130
basically so that they can reuse some of
 

965
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,370
basically so that they can reuse some of
the things like creating a file touching

966
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:30,380
the things like creating a file touching
 

967
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,669
the things like creating a file touching
it and setting the permissions before

968
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:32,679
it and setting the permissions before
 

969
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,669
it and setting the permissions before
adding the content check if a package is

970
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:36,679
adding the content check if a package is
 

971
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,310
adding the content check if a package is
installed it's gonna allow them to see a

972
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,320
installed it's gonna allow them to see a
 

973
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,409
installed it's gonna allow them to see a
response code of either ng which is

974
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:41,419
response code of either ng which is
 

975
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:44,710
response code of either ng which is
presumably not good or okay if the

976
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
presumably not good or okay if the
 

977
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,560
presumably not good or okay if the
package is not found in dpkg query and

978
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:47,570
package is not found in dpkg query and
 

979
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,659
package is not found in dpkg query and
that is going to be called further down

980
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:49,669
that is going to be called further down
 

981
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:51,669
that is going to be called further down
using this loop which grabs a package

982
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
using this loop which grabs a package
 

983
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,900
using this loop which grabs a package
list like raspy - GPIO Python - our PI

984
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:55,910
list like raspy - GPIO Python - our PI
 

985
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,390
list like raspy - GPIO Python - our PI
GPIO and so on and so forth so basically

986
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
GPIO and so on and so forth so basically
 

987
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,130
GPIO and so on and so forth so basically
packages that are going to get installed

988
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,140
packages that are going to get installed
 

989
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,470
packages that are going to get installed
with apt-get so then it goes through a

990
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
with apt-get so then it goes through a
 

991
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,620
with apt-get so then it goes through a
loop here in package list and it goes

992
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:05,630
loop here in package list and it goes
 

993
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,330
loop here in package list and it goes
through that loop installing and

994
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:07,340
through that loop installing and
 

995
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,890
through that loop installing and
approving the installation of each of

996
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:08,900
approving the installation of each of
 

997
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,409
approving the installation of each of
those packages but if any of the

998
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:11,419
those packages but if any of the
 

999
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:14,200
those packages but if any of the
packages fail to install response with

1000
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,210
packages fail to install response with
 

1001
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,659
packages fail to install response with
ng then it's gonna say hey there's

1002
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:16,669
ng then it's gonna say hey there's
 

1003
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:18,190
ng then it's gonna say hey there's
something wrong you're not connected to

1004
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,200
something wrong you're not connected to
 

1005
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,470
something wrong you're not connected to
the internet and it's going to die if

1006
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
the internet and it's going to die if
 

1007
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,530
the internet and it's going to die if
however it because there's no else it's

1008
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:23,540
however it because there's no else it's
 

1009
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,480
however it because there's no else it's
just going to resume if that doesn't

1010
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,490
just going to resume if that doesn't
 

1011
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,700
just going to resume if that doesn't
happen so then it's going to move on to

1012
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:27,710
happen so then it's going to move on to
 

1013
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,820
happen so then it's going to move on to
here so we've named the daemon Argan one

1014
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:30,830
here so we've named the daemon Argan one
 

1015
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,450
here so we've named the daemon Argan one
D and we've got a power button script

1016
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:34,460
D and we've got a power button script
 

1017
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,980
D and we've got a power button script
going to be created in user slash bin

1018
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:35,990
going to be created in user slash bin
 

1019
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,510
going to be created in user slash bin
slash Argan 1d dot pi we've got a

1020
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:40,520
slash Argan 1d dot pi we've got a
 

1021
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,419
slash Argan 1d dot pi we've got a
shutdown script in Lib system D called

1022
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:43,429
shutdown script in Lib system D called
 

1023
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:49,240
shutdown script in Lib system D called
Argan D Argan one D dot - power off dot

1024
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,250
Argan D Argan one D dot - power off dot
 

1025
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,020
Argan D Argan one D dot - power off dot
PI and so on and so forth so those are

1026
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,030
PI and so on and so forth so those are
 

1027
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,970
PI and so on and so forth so those are
just the file names so that they can be

1028
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:54,980
just the file names so that they can be
 

1029
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,070
just the file names so that they can be
reused alright these commands are

1030
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,080
reused alright these commands are
 

1031
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,850
reused alright these commands are
enabling I squared C and I guess do

1032
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:00,860
enabling I squared C and I guess do
 

1033
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,570
enabling I squared C and I guess do
serial that must be serial that's just

1034
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,580
serial that must be serial that's just
 

1035
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,480
serial that must be serial that's just
my guess okay and then we're starting to

1036
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:07,490
my guess okay and then we're starting to
 

1037
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,039
my guess okay and then we're starting to
write out the file so if the daemon

1038
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:09,049
write out the file so if the daemon
 

1039
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,289
write out the file so if the daemon
config file does not

1040
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:10,299
config file does not
 

1041
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:13,079
config file does not
let's create it so we touch it for some

1042
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:13,089
let's create it so we touch it for some
 

1043
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:15,359
let's create it so we touch it for some
reason they're not using their their

1044
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:15,369
reason they're not using their their
 

1045
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,820
reason they're not using their their
function here maybe that's a bug and we

1046
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:17,830
function here maybe that's a bug and we
 

1047
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,649
function here maybe that's a bug and we
could fix it it doesn't matter it's

1048
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:19,659
could fix it it doesn't matter it's
 

1049
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:20,999
could fix it it doesn't matter it's
doing exactly the same thing it's just

1050
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:21,009
doing exactly the same thing it's just
 

1051
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:24,180
doing exactly the same thing it's just
funny that it it is happening

1052
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,190
funny that it it is happening
 

1053
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,680
funny that it it is happening
redundantly they could have used the

1054
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:25,690
redundantly they could have used the
 

1055
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,479
redundantly they could have used the
function these are comments and then at

1056
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:27,489
function these are comments and then at
 

1057
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:29,310
function these are comments and then at
the bottom of the config file are the

1058
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,320
the bottom of the config file are the
 

1059
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,299
the bottom of the config file are the
temperature to fan speed ratios so if it

1060
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:33,309
temperature to fan speed ratios so if it
 

1061
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:36,389
temperature to fan speed ratios so if it
hits 55 degrees C it's gonna set the fan

1062
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:36,399
hits 55 degrees C it's gonna set the fan
 

1063
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,940
hits 55 degrees C it's gonna set the fan
speed to 10% if it hits 60 degrees C

1064
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:38,950
speed to 10% if it hits 60 degrees C
 

1065
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,529
speed to 10% if it hits 60 degrees C
it's gonna set the fan speed to 55 and

1066
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:40,539
it's gonna set the fan speed to 55 and
 

1067
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:44,219
it's gonna set the fan speed to 55 and
65 degrees Celsius is going to set the

1068
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:44,229
65 degrees Celsius is going to set the
 

1069
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:48,239
65 degrees Celsius is going to set the
fan speed to a full 100% so hopefully we

1070
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:48,249
fan speed to a full 100% so hopefully we
 

1071
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:49,889
fan speed to a full 100% so hopefully we
never hit that point so those

1072
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:49,899
never hit that point so those
 

1073
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,079
never hit that point so those
configuration items of course they can

1074
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,089
configuration items of course they can
 

1075
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:54,029
configuration items of course they can
be changed here before you install it or

1076
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,039
be changed here before you install it or
 

1077
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,709
be changed here before you install it or
and that's just going to change the

1078
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:55,719
and that's just going to change the
 

1079
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:58,049
and that's just going to change the
output of the daemon config file or of

1080
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,059
output of the daemon config file or of
 

1081
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:00,119
output of the daemon config file or of
course you can edit that later or you

1082
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:00,129
course you can edit that later or you
 

1083
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,229
course you can edit that later or you
can use the tool that they're going to

1084
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:01,239
can use the tool that they're going to
 

1085
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,569
can use the tool that they're going to
give you in order to make those changes

1086
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:03,579
give you in order to make those changes

there use an argon create file now and

1090
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:10,539
there use an argon create file now and
 

1091
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,509
there use an argon create file now and
this is a Python script that it is

1092
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:12,519
this is a Python script that it is
 

1093
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:15,089
this is a Python script that it is
creating although it's running this in

1094
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:15,099
creating although it's running this in
 

1095
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,129
creating although it's running this in
bash it's so what is doing is it's using

1096
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:17,139
bash it's so what is doing is it's using
 

1097
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:18,959
bash it's so what is doing is it's using
the bash command to output to the

1098
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:18,969
the bash command to output to the
 

1099
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:21,869
the bash command to output to the
shutdown script it's importing sis SM

1100
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:21,879
shutdown script it's importing sis SM

bus from Raspberry Pi GPIO as GPIO and I

1102
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:25,179
bus from Raspberry Pi GPIO as GPIO and I
 

1103
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,029
bus from Raspberry Pi GPIO as GPIO and I
was checking the revision number of the

1104
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
was checking the revision number of the
 

1105
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,989
was checking the revision number of the
Raspberry Pi and acting accordingly

1106
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:29,999
Raspberry Pi and acting accordingly
 

1107
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,669
Raspberry Pi and acting accordingly
moving down power button script this is

1108
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:32,679
moving down power button script this is
 

1109
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:34,469
moving down power button script this is
going to be what happens when you push

1110
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:34,479
going to be what happens when you push
 

1111
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,909
going to be what happens when you push
that power button so again a Python

1112
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
that power button so again a Python
 

1113
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,619
that power button so again a Python
script lets grabbing the bus it's

1114
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:37,629
script lets grabbing the bus it's
 

1115
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:38,629
script lets grabbing the bus it's
grabbing the GPIO

1116
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:38,639
grabbing the GPIO
 

1117
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:43,019
grabbing the GPIO
OS the time and that's not just the time

1118
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:43,029
OS the time and that's not just the time
 

1119
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,789
OS the time and that's not just the time
that's the like the counter and the

1120
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
that's the like the counter and the
 

1121
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,849
that's the like the counter and the
clock and everything else okay what's

1122
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:47,859
clock and everything else okay what's
 

1123
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,709
clock and everything else okay what's
happening here so checks the revision

1124
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:49,719
happening here so checks the revision
 

1125
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:53,399
happening here so checks the revision
again and acts accordingly because it

1126
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:53,409
again and acts accordingly because it
 

1127
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,579
again and acts accordingly because it
may be a little bit different response

1128
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:55,589
may be a little bit different response
 

1129
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:59,779
may be a little bit different response
based on the revision of the board so

1130
00:27:59,779 --> 00:27:59,789
based on the revision of the board so
 

1131
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:03,930
based on the revision of the board so
it's checking the shutdown check this is

1132
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:03,940
it's checking the shutdown check this is
 

1133
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,569
it's checking the shutdown check this is
a function so yeah when you push the

1134
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:06,579
a function so yeah when you push the
 

1135
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:09,419
a function so yeah when you push the
button it responds so when you push it

1136
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:09,429
button it responds so when you push it
 

1137
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:11,999
button it responds so when you push it
when you okay so it's incrementing

1138
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:12,009
when you okay so it's incrementing
 

1139
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:13,879
when you okay so it's incrementing
something called pulse time that's a an

1140
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:13,889
something called pulse time that's a an
 

1141
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,969
something called pulse time that's a an
integer string that well not an integer

1142
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:17,979
integer string that well not an integer
 

1143
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,019
integer string that well not an integer
string but an integer that's

1144
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:19,029
string but an integer that's
 

1145
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:21,539
string but an integer that's
incrementing and every time you push the

1146
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:21,549
incrementing and every time you push the
 

1147
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:23,339
incrementing and every time you push the
button it's kind of it's counting that

1148
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:23,349
button it's kind of it's counting that
 

1149
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:23,810
button it's kind of it's counting that
so

1150
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:23,820
so
 

1151
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,360
so
when you push it twice it's going to

1152
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,370
when you push it twice it's going to
 

1153
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,020
when you push it twice it's going to
safely reboot the the Raspberry Pi now

1154
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,030
safely reboot the the Raspberry Pi now
 

1155
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,670
safely reboot the the Raspberry Pi now
note what's actually happening when you

1156
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:31,680
note what's actually happening when you
 

1157
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,240
note what's actually happening when you
push that button twice is that it's

1158
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,250
push that button twice is that it's
 

1159
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,080
push that button twice is that it's
running the OS system command reboot so

1160
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,090
running the OS system command reboot so
 

1161
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,000
running the OS system command reboot so
it's not doing a hard reboot is not

1162
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,010
it's not doing a hard reboot is not
 

1163
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,290
it's not doing a hard reboot is not
cutting power and then powering it back

1164
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:42,300
cutting power and then powering it back
 

1165
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,360
cutting power and then powering it back
on no it's actually running the reboot

1166
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,370
on no it's actually running the reboot
 

1167
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,710
on no it's actually running the reboot
command that I would run in my bash

1168
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:45,720
command that I would run in my bash
 

1169
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,800
command that I would run in my bash
prompt so it's a safe reboot it's going

1170
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:48,810
prompt so it's a safe reboot it's going
 

1171
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,170
prompt so it's a safe reboot it's going
to automatically sync your SSD it's

1172
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:51,180
to automatically sync your SSD it's
 

1173
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,330
to automatically sync your SSD it's
gonna save your files and whatever else

1174
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:53,340
gonna save your files and whatever else
 

1175
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,830
gonna save your files and whatever else
that it normally would do during a

1176
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:54,840
that it normally would do during a
 

1177
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,050
that it normally would do during a
reboot command you can also add your own

1178
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,060
reboot command you can also add your own
 

1179
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,140
reboot command you can also add your own
stuff here if you wanted to like I could

1180
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,150
stuff here if you wanted to like I could
 

1181
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,970
stuff here if you wanted to like I could
do something like remember this is this

1182
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:01,980
do something like remember this is this
 

1183
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,520
do something like remember this is this
is even though we're typing this in bash

1184
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,530
is even though we're typing this in bash
 

1185
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,740
is even though we're typing this in bash
this is going to be a Python script so

1186
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:06,750
this is going to be a Python script so
 

1187
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,520
this is going to be a Python script so
you could put any Python here any Python

1188
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:10,530
you could put any Python here any Python
 

1189
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,370
you could put any Python here any Python
and then just make sure that you pipe

1190
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:13,380
and then just make sure that you pipe
 

1191
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,120
and then just make sure that you pipe
that with not pipe but direct that to

1192
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,130
that with not pipe but direct that to
 

1193
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,690
that with not pipe but direct that to
dollar sign power button script you

1194
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:20,700
dollar sign power button script you
 

1195
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,780
dollar sign power button script you
could also edit that that file at any

1196
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:26,790
could also edit that that file at any
 

1197
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,050
could also edit that that file at any
time you could edit that power button

1198
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,060
time you could edit that power button
 

1199
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,270
time you could edit that power button
script which is if you go back up it's

1200
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,280
script which is if you go back up it's
 

1201
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,110
script which is if you go back up it's
going to be saved power button script

1202
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,120
going to be saved power button script

pi so you can edit that script and then

1206
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,070
pi so you can edit that script and then
 

1207
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,920
pi so you can edit that script and then
you'll be able to change the what it

1208
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:45,930
you'll be able to change the what it
 

1209
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,060
you'll be able to change the what it
does when you push the power button

1210
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,070
does when you push the power button
 

1211
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,680
does when you push the power button
twice or when you hold it in for three

1212
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:48,690
twice or when you hold it in for three
 

1213
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,670
twice or when you hold it in for three
seconds and and you can make it react

1214
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:52,680
seconds and and you can make it react
 

1215
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,810
seconds and and you can make it react
the way you want maybe you want it to

1216
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:53,820
the way you want maybe you want it to
 

1217
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,040
the way you want maybe you want it to
send you an email or something like that

1218
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,050
send you an email or something like that
 

1219
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,830
send you an email or something like that
you can do that or you have something

1220
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
you can do that or you have something
 

1221
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,170
you can do that or you have something
else like a APC UPS that you want to

1222
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,180
else like a APC UPS that you want to
 

1223
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,790
else like a APC UPS that you want to
have safely turned off or something

1224
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:01,800
have safely turned off or something
 

1225
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,380
have safely turned off or something
after a 30 second time or I don't know

1226
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,390
after a 30 second time or I don't know
 

1227
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,760
after a 30 second time or I don't know
maybe you've got a watchdog plugged into

1228
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:04,770
maybe you've got a watchdog plugged into
 

1229
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,490
maybe you've got a watchdog plugged into
the GPIO you can use that as well

1230
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:07,500
the GPIO you can use that as well
 

1231
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,840
the GPIO you can use that as well
okay so if you push the button for if

1232
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:11,850
okay so if you push the button for if
 

1233
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,660
okay so if you push the button for if
you long press for three seconds it's

1234
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:14,670
you long press for three seconds it's
 

1235
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,960
you long press for three seconds it's
going to run shutdown now - eh so that's

1236
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:17,970
going to run shutdown now - eh so that's
 

1237
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,810
going to run shutdown now - eh so that's
actually a safe shutdown command to

1238
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:20,820
actually a safe shutdown command to
 

1239
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,160
actually a safe shutdown command to
power off your computer so you're not

1240
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,170
power off your computer so you're not
 

1241
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,440
power off your computer so you're not
just killing power like you would if you

1242
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:24,450
just killing power like you would if you
 

1243
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,420
just killing power like you would if you
continue to hold in that button for five

1244
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:26,430
continue to hold in that button for five
 

1245
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,610
continue to hold in that button for five
seconds which is not a safe way to do it

1246
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:28,620
seconds which is not a safe way to do it
 

1247
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,190
seconds which is not a safe way to do it
that's like your last resort but this

1248
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
that's like your last resort but this
 

1249
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,470
that's like your last resort but this
script is as you can see running those

1250
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:33,480
script is as you can see running those
 

1251
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,740
script is as you can see running those
commands as you normally would safely so

1252
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:36,750
commands as you normally would safely so
 

1253
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,610
commands as you normally would safely so
you push that button

1254
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:37,620
you push that button
 

1255
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,560
you push that button
triggers the gpio and it's monitoring

1256
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:39,570
triggers the gpio and it's monitoring
 

1257
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,240
triggers the gpio and it's monitoring
how long you press it or how many times

1258
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,250
how long you press it or how many times
 

1259
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,350
how long you press it or how many times
you press it and then it reacts

1260
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,360
you press it and then it reacts
 

1261
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,390
you press it and then it reacts
accordingly so with a little python

1262
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:44,400
accordingly so with a little python
 

1263
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,799
accordingly so with a little python
knowledge you could make that do

1264
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:45,809
knowledge you could make that do
 

1265
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:48,470
knowledge you could make that do
whatever you want if I push it three

1266
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480
whatever you want if I push it three
 

1267
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,220
whatever you want if I push it three
times I want it to play my favorite song

1268
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,230
times I want it to play my favorite song
 

1269
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,760
times I want it to play my favorite song
that kind of stuff

1270
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:52,770
that kind of stuff
 

1271
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,350
that kind of stuff
whatever you think you can look through

1272
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,360
whatever you think you can look through
 

1273
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,070

here lots of fun so I love that as you

1274
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
here lots of fun so I love that as you
 

1275
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,110

know people who like to look under the
 

1277
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,590
know people who like to look under the
hood we can do so and then when we're

1278
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
hood we can do so and then when we're
 

1279
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,330
hood we can do so and then when we're
done say we've made some changes we can

1280
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:05,340
done say we've made some changes we can
 

1281
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,149
done say we've made some changes we can
control o enter to write our changes and

control o enter to write our changes and
 

1283
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,310
control o enter to write our changes and
then control X to exit and now I just

1284
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
then control X to exit and now I just
 

1285
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,909
then control X to exit and now I just
need to go chmod plus x are gone one dot

press Y alright what do you wanna do

1322
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:07,620
press Y alright what do you wanna do
 

1323
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,430
press Y alright what do you wanna do
always-on let's try it yeah I hear it

1324
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:10,440
always-on let's try it yeah I hear it
 

1325
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,700
always-on let's try it yeah I hear it
you guys hear that it's so quiet even at

1326
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:13,710
you guys hear that it's so quiet even at
 

1327
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,870
you guys hear that it's so quiet even at
on that's pretty good I'm pleased with

1328
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:17,880
on that's pretty good I'm pleased with
 

1329
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,560
on that's pretty good I'm pleased with
that however because it is controlled by

1330
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:21,570
that however because it is controlled by
 

1331
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,340
that however because it is controlled by
an I squared C controller rather than

1332
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,350
an I squared C controller rather than
 

1333
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,440
an I squared C controller rather than
just a GPIO pin it's not just on or off

1334
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,450
just a GPIO pin it's not just on or off
 

1335
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,779
just a GPIO pin it's not just on or off
it's you're able to set the threshold so

1336
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:32,789
it's you're able to set the threshold so
 

1337
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,039
it's you're able to set the threshold so
that's where we can run that

1338
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,049
that's where we can run that
 

1339
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:35,570
that's where we can run that
configuration script again and say

1340
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:35,580
configuration script again and say
 

1341
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,690
configuration script again and say
adjust the temperature so let's bring

1342
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:38,700
adjust the temperature so let's bring
 

1343
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,190
adjust the temperature so let's bring
that up on our screen a little bit I'm

1344
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,200
that up on our screen a little bit I'm
 

1345
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,909
that up on our screen a little bit I'm
having trouble seeing that on my screen

1346
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:46,919

 

1347
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,859

okay so please provide fan speeds for

1348
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:49,869
okay so please provide fan speeds for
 

1349
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:54,229
okay so please provide fan speeds for
the following temperatures 55 C let's do

1350
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:54,239
the following temperatures 55 C let's do
 

1351
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:59,909
the following temperatures 55 C let's do
25% fan speed 60 C let's do 50% fan

1352
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
25% fan speed 60 C let's do 50% fan
 

1353
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,340
25% fan speed 60 C let's do 50% fan
speed 65 C all right 90% okay so now the

1354
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,350
speed 65 C all right 90% okay so now the
 

1355
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,529
speed 65 C all right 90% okay so now the
fan just shut right off because it is

1356
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:07,539
fan just shut right off because it is
 

1357
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:10,619
fan just shut right off because it is
using the passive cooling to keep that

1358
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:10,629
using the passive cooling to keep that
 

1359
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:14,759
using the passive cooling to keep that
thing below 55 I think it was so it's

1360
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:14,769
thing below 55 I think it was so it's
 

1361
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:17,430
thing below 55 I think it was so it's
completely silent if I start using my

1362
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,440
completely silent if I start using my
 

1363
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,330
completely silent if I start using my
raspberry pi to death it's going to spin

1364
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:21,340
raspberry pi to death it's going to spin
 

1365
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,299
raspberry pi to death it's going to spin
up that fan alright so now that I've got

1366
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:24,309
up that fan alright so now that I've got
 

1367
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:25,859
up that fan alright so now that I've got
that script installed presumably if I

1368
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:25,869
that script installed presumably if I
 

1369
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:27,479
that script installed presumably if I
push the power button it's not going to

1370
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:27,489
push the power button it's not going to
 

1371
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:32,009
push the power button it's not going to
do anything nothing however if I push it

1372
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:32,019
do anything nothing however if I push it
 

1373
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,810
do anything nothing however if I push it
two times what's it going to do and

1374
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:33,820
two times what's it going to do and
 

1375
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,970
two times what's it going to do and
we're gonna lose the screen here but if

1376
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:35,980
we're gonna lose the screen here but if
 

1377
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,369
we're gonna lose the screen here but if
it works we know and there it goes and

1378
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:38,379
it works we know and there it goes and
 

1379
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:40,519
it works we know and there it goes and
now notice it's not killing the power I

1380
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:40,529
now notice it's not killing the power I
 

1381
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:43,470
now notice it's not killing the power I
don't know if you can see that but it is

1382
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:43,480
don't know if you can see that but it is
 

1383
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,299
don't know if you can see that but it is
actually done a safe reboot that's

1384
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:48,309
actually done a safe reboot that's
 

1385
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:51,180
actually done a safe reboot that's
fantastic that is the Raspberry Pi 4

1386
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,190
fantastic that is the Raspberry Pi 4
 

1387
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,269
fantastic that is the Raspberry Pi 4
