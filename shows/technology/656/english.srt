ever
um taken carpet adhesive off of uh

1142
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
um taken carpet adhesive off of uh
 

1143
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,750
um taken carpet adhesive off of uh
uh floorboard it's horrible very

1144
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
uh floorboard it's horrible very
 

1145
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,110
uh floorboard it's horrible very
difficult oh yeah i've been using

1146
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
difficult oh yeah i've been using
 

1147
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,390
difficult oh yeah i've been using
that iron on steam

1148
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
that iron on steam
 

1149
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,110
that iron on steam
and just steaming the vegetables out of

1150
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
and just steaming the vegetables out of
 

1151
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,669
and just steaming the vegetables out of
that

1152
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679

 

1153
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,990

if i go to the other side of the attic

1154
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
if i go to the other side of the attic
 

1155
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,350
if i go to the other side of the attic
obviously there's still

1156
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
obviously there's still
 

1157
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,190
obviously there's still
like lots of work that needs to be done

1158
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
like lots of work that needs to be done
 

1159
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,990
like lots of work that needs to be done
up here this is like a horror movie

1160
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
up here this is like a horror movie
 

1161
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,789
up here this is like a horror movie
yeah when you move really quickly

1162
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
yeah when you move really quickly
 

1163
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,070
yeah when you move really quickly
this is going to be my cat 5

1164
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
this is going to be my cat 5
 

1165
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,950
this is going to be my cat 5
office there's plenty of room

1166
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
office there's plenty of room
 

1167
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,470
office there's plenty of room
is it insulated though i mean what's it

1168
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
is it insulated though i mean what's it
 

1169
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,549
is it insulated though i mean what's it
going to be like in the middle of summer

1170
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
going to be like in the middle of summer
 

1171
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,630
going to be like in the middle of summer
that'll be hot well it's really stinking

1172
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
that'll be hot well it's really stinking
 

1173
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,669
that'll be hot well it's really stinking
hot right now

1174
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
hot right now
 

1175
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,830
hot right now
i'm not surprised no insulation in the

1176
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
i'm not surprised no insulation in the
 

1177
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,950
i'm not surprised no insulation in the
rafters

1178
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
rafters
 

1179
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,870
rafters
no none at all in the um

1180
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
no none at all in the um
 

1181
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,149
no none at all in the um
yeah you're gonna have to insulate that

1182
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
yeah you're gonna have to insulate that
 

1183
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,070
yeah you're gonna have to insulate that
whole area there so for that to be

1184
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
whole area there so for that to be
 

1185
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,269
whole area there so for that to be
reliable yeah that

1186
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:43,279
reliable yeah that
 

1187
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,510
reliable yeah that
is my washing machine uh this should be

1188
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
is my washing machine uh this should be
 

1189
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,630
is my washing machine uh this should be
my office down here

1190
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640
my office down here
 

1191
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,470
my office down here
yes you really need to make this part of

1192
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
yes you really need to make this part of
 

1193
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,470
yes you really need to make this part of
your part of this your office it's

1194
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
your part of this your office it's
 

1195
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,750
your part of this your office it's
far more suitable yeah and yeah and in

1196
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
far more suitable yeah and yeah and in
 

1197
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,310
far more suitable yeah and yeah and in
really hot days it will be a very cool

1198
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
really hot days it will be a very cool
 

1199
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,510
really hot days it will be a very cool
little bit cooler

1200
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
little bit cooler
 

1201
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,029
little bit cooler
yeah in my house oh this should be

1202
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
yeah in my house oh this should be
 

1203
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,549
yeah in my house oh this should be
cool

1204
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559

 

1205
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,990

what i think we've decided on is making

1206
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
what i think we've decided on is making
 

1207
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,110
what i think we've decided on is making
a cluster of independent

1208
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
a cluster of independent
 

1209
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,230
a cluster of independent
so a cluster as in uh multiple devices

1210
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
so a cluster as in uh multiple devices
 

1211
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,549
so a cluster as in uh multiple devices
but

1212
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
but
 

1213
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,549
but
independent as in each one will have its

1214
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
independent as in each one will have its
 

1215
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,590
independent as in each one will have its
own distro

1216
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
own distro
 

1217
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,789
own distro
uh raspberry pi unit

1218
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
uh raspberry pi unit
 

1219
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,990
uh raspberry pi unit
that will each have uh the

1220
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
that will each have uh the
 

1221
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,669
that will each have uh the
raspberry pi os and zoom installed

1222
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
raspberry pi os and zoom installed
 

1223
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,990
raspberry pi os and zoom installed
and each one of those has an hdmi output

1224
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
and each one of those has an hdmi output
 

1225
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,789
and each one of those has an hdmi output
so

1226
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
so
 

1227
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,070
so
then each raspberry pi becomes a camera

1228
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
then each raspberry pi becomes a camera
 

1229
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,549
then each raspberry pi becomes a camera
source

1230
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
source
 

1231
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,830
source
essentially for zoom so i'd have

1232
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
essentially for zoom so i'd have
 

1233
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,390
essentially for zoom so i'd have
one raspberry pi dedicated to jeff and

1234
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
one raspberry pi dedicated to jeff and
 

1235
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,710
one raspberry pi dedicated to jeff and
that would be hdmi out into his capture

1236
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
that would be hdmi out into his capture
 

1237
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,990
that would be hdmi out into his capture
and then when i push the button

1238
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
and then when i push the button
 

1239
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,390
and then when i push the button
on the on the stream deck it would

1240
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
on the on the stream deck it would
 

1241
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,310
on the on the stream deck it would
switch to his camera basically

1242
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
switch to his camera basically
 

1243
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,149
switch to his camera basically
uh and then have one for sasha and one

1244
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
uh and then have one for sasha and one
 

1245
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,310
uh and then have one for sasha and one
for henry and however we want to set it

1246
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
for henry and however we want to set it
 

1247
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,789
for henry and however we want to set it
up so

1248
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
up so
 

1249
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,789
up so
it's just like one raspberry pi per

1250
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
it's just like one raspberry pi per
 

1251
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,590
it's just like one raspberry pi per
person

1252
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600

 

1253
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,149

it might work so that's kind of where

1254
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
it might work so that's kind of where
 

1255
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:02,789
it might work so that's kind of where
i'm sorry

1256
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
i'm sorry
 

1257
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,870
i'm sorry
i think i missed what it is you were

1258
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
i think i missed what it is you were
 

1259
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,669
i think i missed what it is you were
meaning to do with that raspberry pi

1260
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
meaning to do with that raspberry pi
 

1261
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,789
meaning to do with that raspberry pi
being able to have it have them come in

1262
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
being able to have it have them come in
 

1263
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,990
being able to have it have them come in
remotely through zoom ah i

1264
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
remotely through zoom ah i
 

1265
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,630
remotely through zoom ah i
see okay because for the show we

1266
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
see okay because for the show we
 

1267
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,149
see okay because for the show we
obviously don't want this grid layout

1268
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
obviously don't want this grid layout
 

1269
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,630
obviously don't want this grid layout
and we

1270
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
and we
 

1271
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,390
and we
can't have it so that it's switching

1272
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
can't have it so that it's switching
 

1273
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,630
can't have it so that it's switching
back and forth every time someone speaks

1274
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:22,640
back and forth every time someone speaks
 

1275
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,710
back and forth every time someone speaks
and but you need to you need a separate

1276
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
and but you need to you need a separate
 

1277
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,390
and but you need to you need a separate
input for each of them so you can edit

1278
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
input for each of them so you can edit
 

1279
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,909
input for each of them so you can edit
them post as much as

1280
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:27,919
them post as much as
 

1281
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,230
them post as much as
any way you like and even live we need

1282
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
any way you like and even live we need
 

1283
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,990
any way you like and even live we need
to be able to switch to the person who's

1284
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
to be able to switch to the person who's
 

1285
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,350
to be able to switch to the person who's
speaking manually

1286
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
speaking manually
 

1287
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,710
speaking manually
and i and and people may not realize but

1288
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
and i and and people may not realize but
 

1289
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,110
and i and and people may not realize but
um zoom cannot be running on the

1290
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
um zoom cannot be running on the
 

1291
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,470
um zoom cannot be running on the
broadcast system because it's

1292
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
broadcast system because it's
 

1293
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,269
broadcast system because it's
broadcasting

1294
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
broadcasting
 

1295
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,990
broadcasting
so that means the good camera that i use

1296
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
so that means the good camera that i use
 

1297
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,789
so that means the good camera that i use
is

1298
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
is
 

1299
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,430
is
out of it basically so during the

1300
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440

live changes yeah i was about to say
this

1316
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600
this
 

1317
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,990
this
wednesday we found that out when my pine

1318
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
wednesday we found that out when my pine
 

1319
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,630
wednesday we found that out when my pine
book pro

1320
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
book pro
 

1321
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,750
book pro
would not work for the feature and then

1322
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
would not work for the feature and then
 

1323
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,110
would not work for the feature and then
so then signed off rebooted

1324
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
so then signed off rebooted
 

1325
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,710
so then signed off rebooted
changed the way i connected things i

1326
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
changed the way i connected things i
 

1327
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,870
changed the way i connected things i
plugged the uh i plugged the

1328
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
plugged the uh i plugged the
 

1329
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,870
plugged the uh i plugged the
atomos ninja flame into the pine book

1330
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
atomos ninja flame into the pine book
 

1331
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,029
atomos ninja flame into the pine book
pro and pushed the cord

1332
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
pro and pushed the cord
 

1333
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,350
pro and pushed the cord
worked flawlessly so so we need about a

1334
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
worked flawlessly so so we need about a
 

1335
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,350
worked flawlessly so so we need about a
half a dozen raspberry pi for eight gigs

1336
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
half a dozen raspberry pi for eight gigs
 

1337
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,630
half a dozen raspberry pi for eight gigs
yeah exactly so well i think four would

1338
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
yeah exactly so well i think four would
 

1339
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,430
yeah exactly so well i think four would
do it because

1340
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
do it because
 

1341
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,070
do it because
four is as many inputs as i have oh

1342
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
four is as many inputs as i have oh
 

1343
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,909
four is as many inputs as i have oh
that's still fun

1344
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919

 

1345
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,990

so then we just so basically that would

1346
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
so then we just so basically that would
 

1347
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,110
so then we just so basically that would
allow us to treat

1348
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,120
allow us to treat
 

1349
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,669
allow us to treat
each person on their zoom connection as

1350
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
each person on their zoom connection as
 

1351
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,310
each person on their zoom connection as
a

1352
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
a
 

1353
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,430
a
as a camera source so i think that could

1354
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
as a camera source so i think that could
 

1355
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,430
as a camera source so i think that could
work and it's probably a pretty good way

1356
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
work and it's probably a pretty good way
 

1357
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,029
work and it's probably a pretty good way
to do it on the cheap

1358
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
to do it on the cheap
 

1359
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,789
to do it on the cheap
on the cheap it's gonna cost like you

1360
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
on the cheap it's gonna cost like you
 

1361
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,710
on the cheap it's gonna cost like you
know four raspberry pies here in canada

1362
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
know four raspberry pies here in canada
 

1363
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,990
know four raspberry pies here in canada
it's like 600 bucks

1364
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000
it's like 600 bucks
 

1365
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,630
it's like 600 bucks
so you know what it's like two dollars

1366
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
so you know what it's like two dollars
 

1367
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,870
so you know what it's like two dollars
american right

because robert's in florida right and
 

1373
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,789
because robert's in florida right and
he's like oh yeah raspberry pi it's only

1374
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
he's like oh yeah raspberry pi it's only
 

1375
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,510
he's like oh yeah raspberry pi it's only
75 bucks for the new one

1376
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
75 bucks for the new one
 

1377
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,310

board
plus you got to buy the power supply

1382
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:19,039
plus you got to buy the power supply
 

1383
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,510
plus you got to buy the power supply
plus you got to buy the case

i'm not even sure i would use it i'm not

1386
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
i'm not even sure i would use it i'm not
 

1387

00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
odroid um
 

1399
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,149

uh what was it c4 i believe
yeah i don't know i haven't looked yet i

1402
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
yeah i don't know i haven't looked yet i
 

1403
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,430
yeah i don't know i haven't looked yet i
don't know if they're any cheaper

1404
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,440
don't know if they're any cheaper
 

1405
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,070
don't know if they're any cheaper
i need to hit up a miradroid and see

1406
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,080
i need to hit up a miradroid and see
 

1407
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,430
i need to hit up a miradroid and see
what they've got but

1408
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
what they've got but
 

1409
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:55,590
what they've got but
maybe that's an option

1410
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600

 

1411
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,070

you've seen this too right um you've

1412
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
you've seen this too right um you've
 

1413
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,110
you've seen this too right um you've
seen where the

1414
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,120
seen where the
 

1415
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,470
seen where the
raspberry pi if it loses power uh

1416
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
raspberry pi if it loses power uh
 

1417
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,789
raspberry pi if it loses power uh
potentially that sd card yeah it's

1418
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
potentially that sd card yeah it's
 

1419
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,830
potentially that sd card yeah it's
corrupted

1420
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
corrupted
 

1421
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,590
corrupted
you can't afford that especially

1422
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:07,600
you can't afford that especially
 

1423
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,870
you can't afford that especially
especially not live

1424
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:08,880
especially not live
 

1425
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,909
especially not live
so you know maybe maybe that's an option

1426
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
so you know maybe maybe that's an option
 

1427
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,230
so you know maybe maybe that's an option
but

1428
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
but
 

1429
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,590
but
i don't know what the price point is

1430
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
i don't know what the price point is
 

1431
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,750
i don't know what the price point is
though so maybe maybe just a bunch of

1432
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
though so maybe maybe just a bunch of
 

1433
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,950
though so maybe maybe just a bunch of
xu4s with

1434
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
xu4s with
 

1435
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,350
xu4s with
uh with emmc

1436
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360

 

1437
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,190

with the desktop yeah i like i like what

1438
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
with the desktop yeah i like i like what
 

1439
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,430
with the desktop yeah i like i like what
you're thinking and it's got hdmi out i

1440
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
you're thinking and it's got hdmi out i
 

1441
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,510
you're thinking and it's got hdmi out i
was strictly thinking

1442
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,520
was strictly thinking
 

1443
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,029
was strictly thinking
you know i i just need a sbc with some

1444
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:31,039
you know i i just need a sbc with some
 

1445
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,029
you know i i just need a sbc with some
hdmi output but you're right it doesn't

1446
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:33,039
hdmi output but you're right it doesn't
 

1447
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,710
hdmi output but you're right it doesn't
have to be raspberry pi

1448
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
have to be raspberry pi
 

1449
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,549
have to be raspberry pi
no um you need for it to work

1450
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
no um you need for it to work
 

1451
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,310
no um you need for it to work
especially when you're live you can't

1452
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
especially when you're live you can't
 

1453
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,830
especially when you're live you can't
afford to be having it break down

1454
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
afford to be having it break down
 

1455
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,630
afford to be having it break down
unexpectedly not just not to say that

1456
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
unexpectedly not just not to say that
 

1457
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,350
unexpectedly not just not to say that
they will

1458
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
they will
 

1459
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,630
they will

1621
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,149
this cooling system is on its last legs
maybe it's about to fail maybe just the

1622
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,159
maybe it's about to fail maybe just the
 

1623
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,110
maybe it's about to fail maybe just the
bearings have gone whatever it might be

1624
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
bearings have gone whatever it might be
 

1625
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,389
bearings have gone whatever it might be
it needs replacing

1626
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399

 

1627
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,470

but it's a big apparatus it's not just a

1628
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480
but it's a big apparatus it's not just a
 

1629
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,509
but it's a big apparatus it's not just a
little fan

1630
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:25,519
little fan
 

1631
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,630
little fan
it's got this whole pipe cooling system

1632
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
it's got this whole pipe cooling system
 

1633
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,710
it's got this whole pipe cooling system
going over to the cpu

1634
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
going over to the cpu
 

1635
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,830
going over to the cpu
so i had to get online and place an

1636
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
so i had to get online and place an
 

1637
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,710
so i had to get online and place an
order

1638
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
order
 

1639
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,630
order
for an identical replacement

1640
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:38,640
for an identical replacement
 

1641
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,470
for an identical replacement
so the laptop while

1642
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
so the laptop while
 

1643
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,909
so the laptop while
i might have thought okay it's dead

1644
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
i might have thought okay it's dead
 

1645
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,149
i might have thought okay it's dead
the cooling system is gone it's going to

1646
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
the cooling system is gone it's going to
 

1647
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,909
the cooling system is gone it's going to
be a lot of work or money

1648
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:49,919
be a lot of work or money
 

1649
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,750
be a lot of work or money
possibly i mean if you took it to a shop

1650
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
possibly i mean if you took it to a shop
 

1651
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,750
possibly i mean if you took it to a shop
it might cost you

1652
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
it might cost you
 

1653
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,909
it might cost you
you know take the price of parts mark it

1654
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
you know take the price of parts mark it
 

1655
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,190
you know take the price of parts mark it
up a bunch and then

1656
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
up a bunch and then
 

1657
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,870
up a bunch and then
add another i don't know

1658
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
add another i don't know
 

1659
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,509
add another i don't know
a couple hundred bucks for labor but

1660
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519
a couple hundred bucks for labor but
 

1661
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,789
a couple hundred bucks for labor but
what if i told you you could do this

1662
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:04,799
what if i told you you could do this
 

1663
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,070
what if i told you you could do this
yourself

1664
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
yourself
 

1665
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,389
yourself
pretty straightforward so that's what

1666
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
pretty straightforward so that's what
 

1667
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,509
pretty straightforward so that's what
i'm gonna set out to do and we're going

1668
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
i'm gonna set out to do and we're going
 

1669
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,830
i'm gonna set out to do and we're going
to see if this is going to make

1670
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:11,840
to see if this is going to make
 

1671
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,990
to see if this is going to make
any amount of difference and kind of how

1672
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
any amount of difference and kind of how
 

1673
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,870
any amount of difference and kind of how
tedious

1674
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
tedious
 

1675
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,549

00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
this is now i've already already had
 

1677
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,470
this is now i've already already had
this old one

this old one
 

1679
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,070
this old one
kind of removed so i've tightened things

1680
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
kind of removed so i've tightened things
 

1681
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,750
kind of removed so i've tightened things
up again just so that the

1682
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
up again just so that the
 

1683
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,149
up again just so that the
thermal compound wouldn't have a problem

you've missed a screw or something you

1720
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,440
you've missed a screw or something you

don't
 

1723
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,430
don't
have to pull so right now for example

00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440
have to pull so right now for example
 

1725
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,550
have to pull so right now for example
i'm noting that there is a

1726
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
i'm noting that there is a

00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
there you go uh a wire that is
 

1729
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,109
there you go uh a wire that is
not wanting to give and it's because

1730
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:17,119
not wanting to give and it's because
 

1731
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,629
not wanting to give and it's because
it's actually part of

so you gotta be mindful of that kind of

1738
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,240
so you gotta be mindful of that kind of
 

1739

so you gotta be mindful of that kind of
thing never yank never pull

let's get our maker on
so this is the central processing unit

1748
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
so this is the central processing unit
 

1749
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,829
so this is the central processing unit

the cpu
 

1751
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,069
the cpu
of our laptop computer so just like your

of our laptop computer so just like your
 

1753
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,069
of our laptop computer so just like your
desktop computer you've got a cpu

now ideally you're going to have
 

1761
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,669
now ideally you're going to have
something like a lint-free

something like a lint-free
 

1763
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,990
something like a lint-free
cloth or perhaps some cotton or

cloth or perhaps some cotton or
 

1765

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,750
something like that to clean with
in pandemic times we're steampunking it

1768
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,760
in pandemic times we're steampunking it
 

1769
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,310
in pandemic times we're steampunking it
out

1770
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,320
out
 

1771
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,230
out
and i'm using paper towel because it's

1772
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
and i'm using paper towel because it's
 

1773
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,390
and i'm using paper towel because it's
all i got and it's all i can get

1774
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
all i got and it's all i can get
 

1775
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,230
all i got and it's all i can get
because the stores are hard to get

1776
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,240
because the stores are hard to get
 

1777
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,589
because the stores are hard to get

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,430
so i just need to be careful that i
don't get lint on that so

1782
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
don't get lint on that so
 

1783
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,349
don't get lint on that so
i do have 99 alcohol this is a

1784
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,359
i do have 99 alcohol this is a
 

1785
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,870
i do have 99 alcohol this is a
solvent that is going to help me to

1786
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
solvent that is going to help me to
 

1787
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,190
solvent that is going to help me to
clean off all of this

1788
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,200
clean off all of this
 

1789
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,910
clean off all of this
thermal paste so you can see how there's

1790
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
thermal paste so you can see how there's
 

1791
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,190
thermal paste so you can see how there's
a bunch of sticky gunk

1792
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
a bunch of sticky gunk
 

1793
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,349
a bunch of sticky gunk
on there which is the thermal compound

1794
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
on there which is the thermal compound
 

1795
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,030
on there which is the thermal compound
that is a conductive

1796
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
that is a conductive
 

1797
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,390
that is a conductive
uh a heat conductive

not to leave like chunks of paper towel
 

1907
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,589
not to leave like chunks of paper towel
behind because paper towel is not

it works it's makeshift it's pandemic
 

1915
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,510
it works it's makeshift it's pandemic
but it works and there is my cpu now so

1916
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,520
but it works and there is my cpu now so
 

1917

receive the new cooling system
 

1923
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,430
receive the new cooling system
and some good new thermal compound

1924
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440
and some good new thermal compound
 

1925
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,030
and some good new thermal compound
all right so here's our cooling system

1926
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,040
all right so here's our cooling system
 

1927
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,790
all right so here's our cooling system
that i picked up online

1928
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
that i picked up online
 

1929
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,030
that i picked up online
and incidentally buying the parts myself

1930

and incidentally buying the parts myself
 

1931
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,950
and incidentally buying the parts myself
was significantly cheaper than getting

1932
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
was significantly cheaper than getting
 

1933
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,630
was significantly cheaper than getting
the parts through a local

1934
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640
the parts through a local
 

1935
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,829
the parts through a local
computer shop and i'm not afraid to goof

1936
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:16,839
computer shop and i'm not afraid to goof
 

1937
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,230
computer shop and i'm not afraid to goof
around

1938
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,240
around
 

1939
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,430
around
there we are again don't force things

1940
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
there we are again don't force things
 

1941
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,790
there we are again don't force things
take your time there it is so here's the

1942
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
take your time there it is so here's the
 

1943
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,470
take your time there it is so here's the
original

1944
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,480
original
 

1945
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,829
original
here's the new one can you tell the

1946
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:30,839

 

1947
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,190

difference

1948
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,200
difference
 

1949
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,829
difference
all right so we want to take a peek at

1950
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
all right so we want to take a peek at
 

1951
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,670
all right so we want to take a peek at
this it looks like they have some

1952
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
this it looks like they have some
 

1953
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,270
this it looks like they have some
thermal compound

1954
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,280
thermal compound
 

1955
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,790
thermal compound
added to the block

1956
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:42,800
added to the block
 

1957
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,510
added to the block
but it has a piece of plastic over top

1958
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:47,520
but it has a piece of plastic over top
 

1959
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,790
but it has a piece of plastic over top
i believe i'm just going to confirm that

1960
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800
i believe i'm just going to confirm that
 

1961
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,270
i believe i'm just going to confirm that
maybe not maybe it's like a

1962
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280

 

1963
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,390

a solid kind of thermal sticker

1964
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,400
a solid kind of thermal sticker
 

1965
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,430
a solid kind of thermal sticker
yeah it is so what i want to do

1966
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:01,440
yeah it is so what i want to do
 

1967
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,349
yeah it is so what i want to do
is i actually want to grab a tube of

1968
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:03,359
is i actually want to grab a tube of
 

1969
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,349
is i actually want to grab a tube of
thermal compound that i've chosen and

1970
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:05,359
thermal compound that i've chosen and
 

1971
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,270
thermal compound that i've chosen and
you can pick up some of this like online

1972
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
you can pick up some of this like online
 

1973
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,710
you can pick up some of this like online
or at your local computer shop if

they're open
 

1977
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,589
they're open
and you just want to get some dabs on

1978
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
and you just want to get some dabs on
 

1979
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,349
and you just want to get some dabs on
there right on

1980
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:13,359
there right on
 

1981
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,870
there right on
the processor this is going to give us a

1982
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:16,880
the processor this is going to give us a
 

1983
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,349
the processor this is going to give us a
good

1984
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:17,359
good
 

1985
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,550
good
thermal contact between the two

1986
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
thermal contact between the two
 

1987
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,950
thermal contact between the two
whoa did that ever come out fast that

1988
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:22,960
whoa did that ever come out fast that
 

1989
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,990
whoa did that ever come out fast that
was not intentional

1990
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
was not intentional
 

1991
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,349
was not intentional
it doesn't really matter you want to

1992
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
it doesn't really matter you want to
 

1993
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,109
it doesn't really matter you want to
just have a little tiny doppel there

1994
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
just have a little tiny doppel there
 

1995
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,190
just have a little tiny doppel there
because as soon as i stick that down

1996
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
because as soon as i stick that down
 

1997
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,470
because as soon as i stick that down
that's just going to go

1998
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:36,480

 

1999
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,589

which is fine but it's a little bit

2000
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
which is fine but it's a little bit
 

2001
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,150
which is fine but it's a little bit
messy

2002
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,160
messy
 

2003
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,790
messy
all right so now i want to remount this

2004
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:42,800
all right so now i want to remount this
 

2005
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,270
all right so now i want to remount this
the new one so i'm mounting the new one

2006
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
the new one so i'm mounting the new one
 

2007
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,750
the new one so i'm mounting the new one
exactly as the old one came out

2008
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760

 

2009
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,829

and that is going to go let's see here

2010
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
and that is going to go let's see here
 

2011
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,950
and that is going to go let's see here
right over top of the cpu

2012
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
right over top of the cpu
 

2013
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,510
right over top of the cpu
let's grab our screwdriver and start

2014
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
let's grab our screwdriver and start
 

2015
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,150
let's grab our screwdriver and start
screwing that down so that that can

2016
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,160
screwing that down so that that can
 

2017
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,390
screwing that down so that that can
get a nice thermal

2018
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,400

 

2019
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,470

linkage between the processor and the

2020
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
linkage between the processor and the
 

2021
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,069
linkage between the processor and the
the copper cooler

2022
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
the copper cooler
 

2023
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,349
the copper cooler
so i'm just tightening them about a

2024
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:15,359
so i'm just tightening them about a
 

2025
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,430
so i'm just tightening them about a
third of the way just to get it

2026
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
third of the way just to get it
 

2027
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,270
third of the way just to get it
affixed and then i'm going to tighten it

2028
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,280
affixed and then i'm going to tighten it
 

2029
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,150
affixed and then i'm going to tighten it
right up there we are

2030
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,160

 

2031
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,069

see there's nothing overly complicated

2032
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
see there's nothing overly complicated
 

2033
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,069
see there's nothing overly complicated
about this type of repair

2034
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:32,079
about this type of repair
 

2035
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,630
about this type of repair
things like upgrading your ram you can

2036
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,640
things like upgrading your ram you can
 

2037
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,550
things like upgrading your ram you can
see that i've got an extra ram module

2038
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
see that i've got an extra ram module
 

2039
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,309
see that i've got an extra ram module
slot here so if i wanted to i could buy

2040
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:38,319
slot here so if i wanted to i could buy
 

2041
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,630
slot here so if i wanted to i could buy
an identical ram

2042
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
an identical ram
 

2043
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,910
an identical ram
dim here and put it here and then i'd

2044
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
dim here and put it here and then i'd
 

2045
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,230
dim here and put it here and then i'd
basically get twice as much ram if you

2046
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,240
basically get twice as much ram if you
 

2047
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,750
basically get twice as much ram if you
wanted to do an upgrade

2048
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,760
wanted to do an upgrade
 

2049
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,510
wanted to do an upgrade
this is my hard drive if i wanted to

2050
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
this is my hard drive if i wanted to
 

2051
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,589
this is my hard drive if i wanted to
upgrade the hard drive put an ssd in

2052
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
upgrade the hard drive put an ssd in
 

2053
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,230
upgrade the hard drive put an ssd in
there

2054
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,240
there
 

2055
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,150
there
i could replace that with an ssd and

2056
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
i could replace that with an ssd and
 

2057
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,470
i could replace that with an ssd and
then reinstall my linux mint

2058
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:56,480
then reinstall my linux mint
 

2059
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,990
then reinstall my linux mint
what else could i do here's a battery

2060
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,000
what else could i do here's a battery
 

2061
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,510
what else could i do here's a battery
for the cmos the

2062
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
for the cmos the
 

2063
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,069
for the cmos the
the memory so i could replace that if i

2064
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
the memory so i could replace that if i
 

2065
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,829
the memory so i could replace that if i
ever start losing

2066
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:04,839
ever start losing
 

2067
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,670
ever start losing
memory which happens after the battery

2068
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
memory which happens after the battery
 

2069
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,390
memory which happens after the battery
gets old

2070
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
gets old
 

2071
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,510
gets old
this is the wi-fi chip here um what else

2072
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:11,520
this is the wi-fi chip here um what else
 

2073
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,349
this is the wi-fi chip here um what else
do we need to see like it's like there

2074
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359
do we need to see like it's like there
 

2075
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,190
do we need to see like it's like there
are so many components here that are so

2076
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200
are so many components here that are so
 

2077
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,510
are so many components here that are so
easily accessible that i could repair

2078
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
easily accessible that i could repair
 

2079
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,790
easily accessible that i could repair
myself which is brilliant

2080
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:20,800
myself which is brilliant
 

2081
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,390
myself which is brilliant
all right so now i need to just give

2082
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,400
all right so now i need to just give
 

2083
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,150
all right so now i need to just give
this a little bit of a

2084
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160

 

2085
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,910

a shimmy there because it's never been

2086
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
a shimmy there because it's never been
 

2087
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,150
a shimmy there because it's never been
in a computer so it's just a little bit

2088
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
in a computer so it's just a little bit
 

2089
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,109
in a computer so it's just a little bit
off on its fitting

2090
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:35,119
off on its fitting
 

2091
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,630
off on its fitting
but it looks great perfect fit really

2092
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
but it looks great perfect fit really
 

2093
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,349
but it looks great perfect fit really
if i can get this final screw to go in

2094
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,359
if i can get this final screw to go in
 

2095
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,829
if i can get this final screw to go in
oh

2096
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839

 

2097
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,870

remember just take your time it's not

2098
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
remember just take your time it's not
 

2099
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,069
remember just take your time it's not
like you're doing a tv

2100
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:50,079
like you're doing a tv
 

2101
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,910
like you're doing a tv
show and you need to make it look like

2102
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:51,920
show and you need to make it look like
 

2103
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,670
show and you need to make it look like
you know what you're doing

2104
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680

 

2105
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,190

there it is so that is strapped in okay

2106
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,200
there it is so that is strapped in okay
 

2107
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,950
there it is so that is strapped in okay
so now we've got

2108
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
so now we've got
 

2109
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,910
so now we've got
our fan in place we've got this guy here

2110
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:05,920
our fan in place we've got this guy here
 

2111
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,950
our fan in place we've got this guy here
which we need to

2112
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
which we need to
 

2113
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,230
which we need to
so this is the cable that was affixed to

2114
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,240
so this is the cable that was affixed to
 

2115
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,270
so this is the cable that was affixed to
the other one it looks like they've

2116
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
the other one it looks like they've
 

2117
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,349
the other one it looks like they've
already included like a double-sided

2118
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:13,359
already included like a double-sided
 

2119
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,670
already included like a double-sided
sticker here an adhesive to reapply that

2120
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
sticker here an adhesive to reapply that
 

2121
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,550
sticker here an adhesive to reapply that
to the new fan that's kind of cool so

2122
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:20,560
to the new fan that's kind of cool so
 

2123
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,230
to the new fan that's kind of cool so
they've thought of it all

2124
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
they've thought of it all
 

2125
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:29,349
they've thought of it all
and then that's going to go right here

2126
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359

 

2127
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,470

whatever this is it might be video or

2128
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,480
whatever this is it might be video or
 

2129
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,390
whatever this is it might be video or
audio or some crazy thing

2130
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,400
audio or some crazy thing
 

2131
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,069
audio or some crazy thing
connecting into the board i'm not too

2132
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
connecting into the board i'm not too
 

2133
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,550
connecting into the board i'm not too
sure

2134
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560

 

2135
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,150

as long as you put it back the way it

2136
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,160
as long as you put it back the way it
 

2137
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,390
as long as you put it back the way it
should go

2138
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
should go
 

2139
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:51,430
should go
you're golden

2140
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:51,440

 

2141
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,190

just like anything as you disassemble

2142
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
just like anything as you disassemble
 

2143
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,349
just like anything as you disassemble
something make sure you observe

2144
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:55,359
something make sure you observe
 

2145
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,470
something make sure you observe
how it goes back together and now here's

2146
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,480
how it goes back together and now here's
 

2147
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:58,950
how it goes back together and now here's
the

2148
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
the
 

2149
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,309
the
fan power and pwm

2150
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
fan power and pwm
 

2151
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,790
fan power and pwm
for the power management and i'm just

2152
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
for the power management and i'm just
 

2153
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,230
for the power management and i'm just
going to carefully

2154
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
going to carefully
 

2155
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,829
going to carefully
plug that in where the old fan

2156
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:10,839

 

2157
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,990

unplugged

2158
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000

 

2159
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,190

and that

2160
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,200

 

2161
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,589

that is a problem because the fan that i

2162
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:25,599
that is a problem because the fan that i
 

2163
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,710
that is a problem because the fan that i
ordered has

2164
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
ordered has
 

2165
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,910
ordered has
two more pins

2166
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920

 

2167
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,750

or it's just a different adapter let's

2168
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
or it's just a different adapter let's
 

2169
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,309
or it's just a different adapter let's
count the cables so let's see

2170
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:36,319
count the cables so let's see
 

2171
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,510
count the cables so let's see
we've got one

2172
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:39,520

 

2173
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,109

one two three four five

2174
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:43,119
one two three four five
 

2175
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,309
one two three four five
and on the old fan we've got

2176
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
and on the old fan we've got
 

2177
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,990
and on the old fan we've got
one two three four five okay

2178
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,000
one two three four five okay
 

2179
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,150
one two three four five okay
so i'm going to have to do a little bit

2180
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160
so i'm going to have to do a little bit
 

2181
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,990
so i'm going to have to do a little bit
of a modification here in order to

2182
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,000
of a modification here in order to
 

2183
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,030
of a modification here in order to
get this fan to be able to connect

2184
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,040
get this fan to be able to connect
 

2185
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,550
get this fan to be able to connect
to this power supply which is fine

2186
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:00,560
to this power supply which is fine
 

2187
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,589
to this power supply which is fine
except i have a problem

2188
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:05,599

 

2189
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,030

i'm operating in pandemic mode

2190
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,040
i'm operating in pandemic mode
 

2191
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,790
i'm operating in pandemic mode
and i in this studio space

2192
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:12,800
and i in this studio space
 

2193
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,190
and i in this studio space
have not yet unpacked my soldering tools

2194
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
have not yet unpacked my soldering tools
 

2195
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,750
have not yet unpacked my soldering tools
so this feature which is meant to be

2196
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:19,760
so this feature which is meant to be
 

2197
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,349
so this feature which is meant to be
just finished today

2198
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
just finished today
 

2199
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,190
just finished today
is going to end up being a two-part

2200
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
is going to end up being a two-part
 

2201
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,630
is going to end up being a two-part
because i'm going to have to solder

2202
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
because i'm going to have to solder
 

2203
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,829
because i'm going to have to solder
these wires together

2204
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
these wires together
 

2205
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,910
these wires together
so what i have done is i've removed the

2206
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:29,920
so what i have done is i've removed the
 

2207
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,430
so what i have done is i've removed the
incorrect header and i've separated out

2208
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
incorrect header and i've separated out
 

2209
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,670
incorrect header and i've separated out
the wires they are all color coded so

2210
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:35,680
the wires they are all color coded so
 

2211
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,630
the wires they are all color coded so
i'm good to go

2212
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
i'm good to go
 

2213
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,190
i'm good to go
and i've got the correct header right

2214
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:39,200
and i've got the correct header right
 

2215
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,109
and i've got the correct header right
here from the old fan

2216
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
here from the old fan
 

2217
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,630
here from the old fan
so what we're going to be doing is we're

2218
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:42,640
so what we're going to be doing is we're
 

2219
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,390
so what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be connecting these wires

2220
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
going to be connecting these wires
 

2221
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,750
going to be connecting these wires
together correctly

2222
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
together correctly
 

2223
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,790
together correctly
but i need to heat shrink tube them

2224
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,800
but i need to heat shrink tube them
 

2225
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,069
but i need to heat shrink tube them
heat tube shrink them i don't know

2226
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
heat tube shrink them i don't know
 

2227
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,710
heat tube shrink them i don't know
i need to connect those together with

2228
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:54,720
i need to connect those together with
 

2229
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,349
i need to connect those together with
solder

2230
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
solder
 

2231
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,910
solder
and i need to shrink tube them as well

2232
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
and i need to shrink tube them as well
 

2233
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,670
and i need to shrink tube them as well
to protect the cable

2234
00:44:59,670 --> 00:44:59,680
to protect the cable
 

2235
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,630
to protect the cable
so unfortunately i don't have the tools

2236
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:02,640
so unfortunately i don't have the tools
 

2237
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,990
so unfortunately i don't have the tools
at my disposal

2238
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,000
at my disposal
 

2239
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,750
at my disposal
in order to do that right now that said

2240
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:07,760
in order to do that right now that said
 

2241
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,670
in order to do that right now that said
i will have and we'll be able to

2242
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
i will have and we'll be able to
 

2243
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,790
i will have and we'll be able to
complete this

2244
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:10,800
complete this
 

2245
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,790
complete this
on a very soon future episode

2246
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
on a very soon future episode
 

2247
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,870
on a very soon future episode
but everything else fit perfectly it's

2248
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,880
but everything else fit perfectly it's
 

2249
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,309
but everything else fit perfectly it's
just that header

2250
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
just that header
 

2251
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,990
just that header
which is unfortunate i had hoped that

2252
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,000
which is unfortunate i had hoped that
 

2253
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,829
which is unfortunate i had hoped that
we'd be able just to pull this off very

2254
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
we'd be able just to pull this off very
 

2255
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,630
we'd be able just to pull this off very
easily tonight but it does turn into a

2256
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:24,640
easily tonight but it does turn into a
 

2257
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,630
easily tonight but it does turn into a
bit more of a maker tech solution

2258
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
bit more of a maker tech solution
 

2259
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,829
bit more of a maker tech solution
doesn't it since the

2260
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
doesn't it since the
 

2261
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,750
doesn't it since the
since we do have to do some soldering

2262

seven days
 

2767
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,069
seven days
as we can see no big changes here last

2768
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
as we can see no big changes here last
 

2769

week it was a draw on

2770
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:57,599
week it was a draw on
 

2771
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,270
week it was a draw on
274 billion today or currently it's 278

2772
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
274 billion today or currently it's 278
 

2773
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,390
274 billion today or currently it's 278
billion

2774
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
billion
 

2775
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,950
billion
bitcoin had an increase of 2.4 percent

2776
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:04,960
bitcoin had an increase of 2.4 percent
 

2777
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,470
bitcoin had an increase of 2.4 percent
in last seven days

2778
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:06,480
in last seven days
 

2779
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,190
in last seven days
but if we sort this year by seven days

2780
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,200
but if we sort this year by seven days
 

2781
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,270
but if we sort this year by seven days
we see suddenly compound

2782
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
we see suddenly compound
 

2783
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,630
we see suddenly compound
increasing by 292 percent the over 20

2784
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,640
increasing by 292 percent the over 20
 

2785
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,190
increasing by 292 percent the over 20
coins

2786
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200
coins
 

2787
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,309
coins
that had an increase of over 15 percent

2788
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:18,319
that had an increase of over 15 percent
 

2789
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,190
that had an increase of over 15 percent
and on the downside only two coins lost

2790
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:21,200
and on the downside only two coins lost
 

2791
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,950
and on the downside only two coins lost
more than 15 percent

2792
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960
more than 15 percent
 

2793
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,030
more than 15 percent
so what happened here why is there

2794
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,040
so what happened here why is there
 

2795
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,430
so what happened here why is there
suddenly such a big change

2796
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:27,440
suddenly such a big change
 

2797
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,589
suddenly such a big change
and if we look into the d5 market cap

2798
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
and if we look into the d5 market cap
 

2799
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,710
and if we look into the d5 market cap
because compound

2800
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
because compound
 

2801
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,510
because compound
is part of the d5 market we see that

2802
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
is part of the d5 market we see that
 

2803
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,710
is part of the d5 market we see that
most of those changes

2804
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
most of those changes
 

2805
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,150
most of those changes
are coming from uh compound so last week

2806
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:38,160
are coming from uh compound so last week
 

2807
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,030
are coming from uh compound so last week
i showed you this

2808
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
i showed you this
 

2809
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,150
i showed you this
uh this chart and it was a 2.3 billion

2810
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
uh this chart and it was a 2.3 billion
 

2811
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,630
uh this chart and it was a 2.3 billion
now it's

2812
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,640
now it's
 

2813
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,670
now it's
6.7 billion as you can see most of that

2814
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
6.7 billion as you can see most of that
 

2815
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,710
6.7 billion as you can see most of that
is coming from compound now let's dive a

2816
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
is coming from compound now let's dive a
 

2817
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,069
is coming from compound now let's dive a
little bit deeper into this here and

2818
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:50,079
little bit deeper into this here and
 

2819
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,990
little bit deeper into this here and
check what happened

2820
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,000
check what happened
 

2821
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,750
check what happened
and if we take a look at the compound

2822
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
and if we take a look at the compound
 

2823
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,829
and if we take a look at the compound
plat platform so compound

2824
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:55,839
plat platform so compound
 

2825
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,549
plat platform so compound
dot finance we see it's basically like a

2826
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
dot finance we see it's basically like a
 

2827
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,990
dot finance we see it's basically like a
bank so you can

2828
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,000
bank so you can
 

2829
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,270
bank so you can
supply money to the environment or you

2830
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:03,280
supply money to the environment or you
 

2831
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,470
supply money to the environment or you
can borrow money

2832
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,480
can borrow money
 

2833
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,030
can borrow money
and in the case of let's say bit basic

2834
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040
and in the case of let's say bit basic
 

2835
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,549
and in the case of let's say bit basic
attention token

2836
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:08,559
attention token
 

2837
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,430
attention token
you will receive 27 and if you borrow

2838
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:11,440
you will receive 27 and if you borrow
 

2839
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,910
you will receive 27 and if you borrow
money you have to pay 34

2840
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:13,920
money you have to pay 34
 

2841
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,030
money you have to pay 34
so far everything is fine now

2842
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
so far everything is fine now
 

2843
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,349
so far everything is fine now
last week a compound was listed on

2844
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:19,359
last week a compound was listed on
 

2845
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,789
last week a compound was listed on
coinbase and that

2846
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
coinbase and that
 

2847
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,190
coinbase and that
caused a huge increase in price and

2848
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:23,200
caused a huge increase in price and
 

2849
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,150
caused a huge increase in price and
because of that

2850
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,160
because of that
 

2851
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,390
because of that
this environment went absolutely crazy

2852
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:26,400
this environment went absolutely crazy
 

2853
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,510
this environment went absolutely crazy
and the reason is

2854
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,520
and the reason is
 

2855
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,349
and the reason is
that every time you take out a loan or

2856
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
that every time you take out a loan or
 

2857
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,910
that every time you take out a loan or
receive money you'll be compensated with

2858
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:31,920
receive money you'll be compensated with
 

2859
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,549
receive money you'll be compensated with
comps

2860
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
comps
 

2861
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,710
comps
which is the native token of this

2862
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,720
which is the native token of this
