date that is all there is to it so your
 

341
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,150
date that is all there is to it so your
mikrotik router is now running the

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,160
mikrotik router is now running the
 

343
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,380
mikrotik router is now running the
latest and greatest firmware

latest and greatest firmware
 

345
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,760
latest and greatest firmware
next in our mikrotik series is how to

346
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:38,770
next in our mikrotik series is how to
 

347
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,700
next in our mikrotik series is how to
assign a static IP address to a device

348
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:41,710
assign a static IP address to a device
 

349
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,770
assign a static IP address to a device
in your DHCP in your DHCP pool so I'm

350
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:46,780
in your DHCP in your DHCP pool so I'm
 

351
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,740
in your DHCP in your DHCP pool so I'm
gonna just sign in to web fig here on my

352
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:49,750
gonna just sign in to web fig here on my
 

353
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,610
gonna just sign in to web fig here on my
laptop and I want to show you how easy

354
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:53,620
laptop and I want to show you how easy
 

355
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,500
laptop and I want to show you how easy
this is to do so click on IP and click

356
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:58,510
this is to do so click on IP and click
 

357
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:04,170
this is to do so click on IP and click
on DHCP server and click on leases this

358
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,180
on DHCP server and click on leases this
 

359
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,290
on DHCP server and click on leases this
is an important thing to do because

360
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,300
is an important thing to do because
 

361
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,880
is an important thing to do because
you're gonna need to have static IP

362
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:08,890
you're gonna need to have static IP
 

363
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,250
you're gonna need to have static IP
addressing on your network for things

364
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,260
addressing on your network for things
 

365
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,060
addressing on your network for things

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:17,860
looking at piehole for example so my
 

369
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,780
looking at piehole for example so my
piehole Server is in fact set as

so these ones are dynamic see these

376
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:34,919
so these ones are dynamic see these
 

377
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,880
so these ones are dynamic see these

dynamic Dee the ones that are that have
 

379
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,829
dynamic Dee the ones that are that have
a Dee button that button will actually

380
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:40,839
a Dee button that button will actually
 

381
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,630
a Dee button that button will actually
convert it to dynamic but they are

382
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
convert it to dynamic but they are
 

383
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,260
convert it to dynamic but they are
currently static so let's look at I've

384
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,270
currently static so let's look at I've
 

385
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,470
currently static so let's look at I've
got a let's grab my phone there's my

386
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,480
got a let's grab my phone there's my
 

387
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,970
got a let's grab my phone there's my
poco phone so I'm just going to click on

388
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:50,980
poco phone so I'm just going to click on
 

389
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,920
poco phone so I'm just going to click on
that and it's currently assigned to

390
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:52,930
that and it's currently assigned to
 

391
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,360
that and it's currently assigned to
10.0.0.0 7 so I'm just simply going to

392
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,370
10.0.0.0 7 so I'm just simply going to
 

393
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,250
10.0.0.0 7 so I'm just simply going to
press make static and now it has been

394
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,260
press make static and now it has been
 

395
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,530
press make static and now it has been
assigned to 10.0.0.0 7 static but if I

396
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:07,540
assigned to 10.0.0.0 7 static but if I
 

397
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,840
assigned to 10.0.0.0 7 static but if I
close that now you'll see 107 has that D

398
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:12,850
close that now you'll see 107 has that D
 

399
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,790
close that now you'll see 107 has that D
next to it and no longer is it dynamic

400
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
next to it and no longer is it dynamic
 

401
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,920
next to it and no longer is it dynamic
so now if I open it by single clicking

402
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:16,930
so now if I open it by single clicking
 

403
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,230
so now if I open it by single clicking
on it I get all these new options and

404
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,240
on it I get all these new options and
 

405
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,480
on it I get all these new options and
now I can assign it its own IP address

406
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,490
now I can assign it its own IP address
 

407
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,690
now I can assign it its own IP address
something that is not currently in use

something that is not currently in use
 

409
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,510
something that is not currently in use
on my pool so I can assign that 2.88 and

410
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:27,520
on my pool so I can assign that 2.88 and
 

411
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,340
on my pool so I can assign that 2.88 and
hit OK and now my polka phone is 10 0

you install a new printer on a network

and you go to that printer and you type
 

465
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,300
and you go to that printer and you type

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,150
the pool now your DHCP server doesn't
even know that it exists because it did

470
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
even know that it exists because it did
 

471
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,300
even know that it exists because it did
not assign the IP address so what we're

472
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,310
not assign the IP address so what we're
 

473
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,980
not assign the IP address so what we're
doing here is completely different what

474
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:14,990
doing here is completely different what
 

475
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,060
doing here is completely different what
we're doing is we're setting the

476
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,070
we're doing is we're setting the
 

477
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,700
we're doing is we're setting the
reservation in the DHCP server

478
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:18,710
reservation in the DHCP server
 

479
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,280
reservation in the DHCP server
so that printer is still just getting

480
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,290
so that printer is still just getting
 

481
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,460
so that printer is still just getting
the IP address from the DHCP server so

482
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:24,470
the IP address from the DHCP server so
 

483
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,140
the IP address from the DHCP server so
does it have to be outside of the pool

484
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,150
does it have to be outside of the pool
 

485
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,110
does it have to be outside of the pool
now no the reason it would have to be if

486
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
now no the reason it would have to be if
 

487
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,760
now no the reason it would have to be if
I was typing it in manually onto the

I was typing it in manually onto the

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,610
I was typing it in manually onto the
printer is because when the DHCP server

490
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:33,620
printer is because when the DHCP server
 

491
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,730
printer is because when the DHCP server
then assigns that IP address to another

492
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:36,740
then assigns that IP address to another
 

493
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,890
then assigns that IP address to another
device on your network it's going to

494
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:38,900
device on your network it's going to
 

495
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,050
device on your network it's going to
cause an IP collision conflict so you're

496
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,060
cause an IP collision conflict so you're
 

497
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,360
cause an IP collision conflict so you're
gonna have two devices sharing the same

498
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,370
gonna have two devices sharing the same
 

499
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,420
gonna have two devices sharing the same
IP address and you're gonna get all

500
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,430
IP address and you're gonna get all
 

501
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,820

kinds of like ARP attacks warning ARP
attack warnings things like that because

attack warnings things like that because
 

505
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,570
attack warnings things like that because
you've got these collisions occurring

you've got these collisions occurring

slow all of a sudden that's a problem
 

511
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,810

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,060
okay so now that you've apparently got
 

627
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,600
okay so now that you've apparently got
your piehole all set up let's see how to

628
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:50,610
your piehole all set up let's see how to
 

629
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,690
your piehole all set up let's see how to
configure this on our mikrotik router so

630
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:53,700
configure this on our mikrotik router so
 

631
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,800
configure this on our mikrotik router so
on my network my piehole device is at

632
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:57,810
on my network my piehole device is at
 

633
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,940
on my network my piehole device is at
10.00 - your DNS server obviously has to

634
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:01,950
10.00 - your DNS server obviously has to
 

635
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,890
10.00 - your DNS server obviously has to
have a static IP address within your

636
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:03,900
have a static IP address within your
 

637
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,110
have a static IP address within your
network so that's the IP address that

638
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,120
network so that's the IP address that
 

639
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,060
network so that's the IP address that
I'm going to be routing my DNS traffic

640
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,070
I'm going to be routing my DNS traffic
 

641
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,130
I'm going to be routing my DNS traffic
to so I want to show you a couple things

642
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,140
to so I want to show you a couple things
 

643
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,810
to so I want to show you a couple things
here in web Figg so I'm gonna click on

644
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:11,820
here in web Figg so I'm gonna click on
 

645
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,720
here in web Figg so I'm gonna click on
IP which is already open and then DNS so

646
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:14,730
IP which is already open and then DNS so
 

647
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,520
IP which is already open and then DNS so
when I go in there you're gonna see the

648
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:16,530
when I go in there you're gonna see the
 

649
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,260
when I go in there you're gonna see the
dynamic servers that my network is

650
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,270
dynamic servers that my network is
 

651
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,060
dynamic servers that my network is
currently dishing out to all my devices

652
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,070
currently dishing out to all my devices
 

653
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,160
currently dishing out to all my devices
through DHCP well I want to change that

654
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,170
through DHCP well I want to change that
 

655
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,140
through DHCP well I want to change that
I want to actually set these to be my

656
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,150
I want to actually set these to be my
 

657
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,310
I want to actually set these to be my
piehole

658
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,320
piehole
 

659
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,350
piehole
but you notice I can't actually change

660
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
but you notice I can't actually change
 

661
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,270
but you notice I can't actually change
those it doesn't allow me to make any

662
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,280
those it doesn't allow me to make any
 

663
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,480
those it doesn't allow me to make any
changes here so first what I have to do

664
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:32,490
changes here so first what I have to do
 

665
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,260
changes here so first what I have to do
is click on DHCP client click on your

666
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,270
is click on DHCP client click on your
 

667
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,050
is click on DHCP client click on your
ether one in my case which is you'll

668
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,060
ether one in my case which is you'll
 

669
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,120
ether one in my case which is you'll
remember from earlier in our mikrotik

670
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,130
remember from earlier in our mikrotik
 

671
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,800
remember from earlier in our mikrotik
series the ether one interface is my

672
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:44,810
series the ether one interface is my
 

673
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,270
series the ether one interface is my
internet connection so that's the actual

674
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,280
internet connection so that's the actual
 

675
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,730
internet connection so that's the actual
connection to the router from the router

676
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,740
connection to the router from the router
 

677
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,310
connection to the router from the router
to the modem to give me my internet

678
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
to the modem to give me my internet
 

679
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,420
to the modem to give me my internet
connectivity so I'm going to click on

680
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,430
connectivity so I'm going to click on
 

681
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,720
connectivity so I'm going to click on
that

682
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:53,730
that
 

683
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,620
that
and I'm going to turn off use peer DNS

684
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:57,630
and I'm going to turn off use peer DNS
 

685
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,840
and I'm going to turn off use peer DNS
so basically I'm saying I don't want to

686
00:15:59,840 --> 00:15:59,850
so basically I'm saying I don't want to
 

687
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,210
so basically I'm saying I don't want to
use the DNS that's given to me by my ISP

688
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,220
use the DNS that's given to me by my ISP
 

689
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,420
use the DNS that's given to me by my ISP
and hit OK now when I go to what when I

691
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,220
and hit OK now when I go to what when I
go to DNS you'll see now dynamic servers

692
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,230
go to DNS you'll see now dynamic servers
 

693
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,120
go to DNS you'll see now dynamic servers
are gone there's nothing there and

I should get a mouse okay so see we're
 

731
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,010
I should get a mouse okay so see we're
back on the dynamic so I'm going to

is that what's doing it yeah now we're
gonna see ads there you go so Firefox is

780
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,410
gonna see ads there you go so Firefox is
 

781
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,190
gonna see ads there you go so Firefox is
now including an ad blocker that's cool

782
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,200
now including an ad blocker that's cool
 

783
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,500
now including an ad blocker that's cool
but understand so well if Firefox

784
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:21,510
but understand so well if Firefox
 

785
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,000
but understand so well if Firefox
already has an ad blocker why do we need

786
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,010
already has an ad blocker why do we need
 

787
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,590
already has an ad blocker why do we need
to go to all this work why do we need a

788
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:24,600
to go to all this work why do we need a
 

789
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,980
to go to all this work why do we need a
pie hole remember how I said this does

790
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:27,990
pie hole remember how I said this does
 

791
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,980
pie hole remember how I said this does
the ad blocking at the DNS level so and

792
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:30,990
the ad blocking at the DNS level so and
 

793
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,330
the ad blocking at the DNS level so and
I hinted to the fact that you're going

794
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,340
I hinted to the fact that you're going
 

795
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,680
I hinted to the fact that you're going
to reduce your bandwidth consumption

796
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:33,690
to reduce your bandwidth consumption
 

797
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,700
to reduce your bandwidth consumption
you're going to speed up your internet

798
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:34,710
you're going to speed up your internet
 

799
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,289
you're going to speed up your internet
and

800
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:35,299
and
 

801
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:38,049
and
that is because with something like an

802
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:38,059
that is because with something like an
 

803
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,759
that is because with something like an
ad blocking plugin

804
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:39,769
ad blocking plugin
 

805
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:43,659
ad blocking plugin
or an ad blocking browser traditionally

806
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:43,669
or an ad blocking browser traditionally
 

807
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,580
or an ad blocking browser traditionally
what happens is is it still downloads

808
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:45,590
what happens is is it still downloads
 

809
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,299
what happens is is it still downloads
the ad it just hides it it blocks it but

810
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:49,309
the ad it just hides it it blocks it but
 

811
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,669
the ad it just hides it it blocks it but
with the DNS level blocking it's

812
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
with the DNS level blocking it's
 

813
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,129
with the DNS level blocking it's
actually the request to the ad servers

814
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:54,139
actually the request to the ad servers
 

815
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:57,970
actually the request to the ad servers
that respond with a null response so

816
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:57,980
that respond with a null response so
 

817
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,549
that respond with a null response so
it's actually blocking the ability for

818
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
it's actually blocking the ability for
 

819
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,430
it's actually blocking the ability for
your computer to reach the ad server at

820
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
your computer to reach the ad server at
 

821
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,680
your computer to reach the ad server at
all it can't download anything they

822
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:05,690
all it can't download anything they
 

823
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,539
all it can't download anything they
can't track you they can't trace that

824
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:07,549
can't track you they can't trace that
 

825
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,570
can't track you they can't trace that
request it doesn't matter there it's

826
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:10,580
request it doesn't matter there it's
 

827
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,279
request it doesn't matter there it's
gonna be blocked at the DNS level so

828
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:12,289
gonna be blocked at the DNS level so
 

829
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,169
gonna be blocked at the DNS level so
there's so much more to it so now that

830
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:14,179
there's so much more to it so now that
 

831
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:15,999
there's so much more to it so now that
I've got this you block disable you can

832
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:16,009
I've got this you block disable you can
 

833
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,489
I've got this you block disable you can
see there's a Google ad right here okay

834
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:18,499
see there's a Google ad right here okay
 

835
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:21,639
see there's a Google ad right here okay
so back over to my micro tick here let's

836
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:21,649
so back over to my micro tick here let's
 

837
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:25,869
so back over to my micro tick here let's
again go to DHCP client under IP and

838
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:25,879
again go to DHCP client under IP and
 

839
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:27,820
again go to DHCP client under IP and
there are many ways to do this you can

840
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:27,830
there are many ways to do this you can
 

841
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,460
there are many ways to do this you can
do this on a network by network basis if

842
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:30,470
do this on a network by network basis if
 

843
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,749
do this on a network by network basis if
you want but I'm just going to do this

844
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:31,759
you want but I'm just going to do this
 

845
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,720
you want but I'm just going to do this
on my entire network because I want any

846
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:34,730
on my entire network because I want any
 

847
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,609
on my entire network because I want any
device that is on my network to go

848
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:36,619
device that is on my network to go
 

849
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,560
device that is on my network to go
through the pie hole I can turn off use

850
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,570
through the pie hole I can turn off use
 

851
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:44,009
through the pie hole I can turn off use
peer DNS and hit ok now go to DNS and

852
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:44,019
peer DNS and hit ok now go to DNS and
 

853
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:50,920
peer DNS and hit ok now go to DNS and
add my pie hole 10.0

854
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:50,930
add my pie hole 10.0
 

855
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,760
add my pie hole 10.0
0.2 and this is all quite instantaneous

856
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:54,770
0.2 and this is all quite instantaneous
 

857
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,370
0.2 and this is all quite instantaneous
however there are a couple of things to

858
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:57,380
however there are a couple of things to
 

859
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,200
however there are a couple of things to
note so I'm going to clear my cache

860
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,210
note so I'm going to clear my cache
 

861
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,860
note so I'm going to clear my cache
this is DNS cache flush cache so now

862
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:02,870
this is DNS cache flush cache so now
 

863
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,480
this is DNS cache flush cache so now
anything that has already been accessed

864
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:04,490
anything that has already been accessed
 

865
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,750
anything that has already been accessed
is flushed out of the DNS cache and so

866
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
is flushed out of the DNS cache and so
 

867
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,900
is flushed out of the DNS cache and so
it's not going to be it's it's gonna

868
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:10,910
it's not going to be it's it's gonna
 

869
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,910
it's not going to be it's it's gonna
request it a game and go through the pie

870
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:12,920
request it a game and go through the pie
 

871
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,640
request it a game and go through the pie
hole the other thing to keep in mind is

872
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:15,650
hole the other thing to keep in mind is
 

873
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,730
hole the other thing to keep in mind is
you could if you wanted to go into the

874
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:18,740
you could if you wanted to go into the
 

875
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,020
you could if you wanted to go into the
HCP server networks so instead of doing

876
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,030
HCP server networks so instead of doing
 

877
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,990
HCP server networks so instead of doing
this at DNS I could just say okay my LAN

878
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
this at DNS I could just say okay my LAN
 

879
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,830
this at DNS I could just say okay my LAN
or my these are my guest Wi-Fi networks

880
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
or my these are my guest Wi-Fi networks
 

881
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,000
or my these are my guest Wi-Fi networks
I could just add a specific DNS server

882
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,010
I could just add a specific DNS server
 

883
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,380
I could just add a specific DNS server
for those so I could do that see how

884
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:37,390
for those so I could do that see how
 

885
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,000
for those so I could do that see how
diverse the configuration can be with a

886
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,010
diverse the configuration can be with a
 

887
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,310
diverse the configuration can be with a
mikrotik so by doing it that way you

888
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
mikrotik so by doing it that way you
 

889
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,800
mikrotik so by doing it that way you
could have multiple pie holes with

890
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:44,810
could have multiple pie holes with
 

891
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,240
could have multiple pie holes with
multiple different settings you could

892
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,250
multiple different settings you could
 

893
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,300
multiple different settings you could
have a mum and dad Wi-Fi that has that

894
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,310
have a mum and dad Wi-Fi that has that
 

895
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,610
have a mum and dad Wi-Fi that has that
has direct access through like Google's

896
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:51,620
has direct access through like Google's
 

897
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,500
has direct access through like Google's
DNS or something like that if you don't

898
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:53,510
DNS or something like that if you don't
 

899
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,470
DNS or something like that if you don't
want to block things you can have your

900
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
want to block things you can have your
 

901
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,650
want to block things you can have your
guest Wi-Fi have a more hardened DNS

902
00:20:59,650 --> 00:20:59,660
guest Wi-Fi have a more hardened DNS
 

903
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,750
guest Wi-Fi have a more hardened DNS
filter for example so you can do that at

904
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
filter for example so you can do that at
 

905
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,960
filter for example so you can do that at
a network level in my case as I say I'm

906
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:04,970
a network level in my case as I say I'm
 

907
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,120
a network level in my case as I say I'm
not doing it at this level I'm doing it

908
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,130
not doing it at this level I'm doing it
 

909
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,770
not doing it at this level I'm doing it
on my full network so my ether one is

910
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:11,780
on my full network so my ether one is
 

911
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,670
on my full network so my ether one is
gonna go through 10.0.0.0 love its DNS

912
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:15,680
gonna go through 10.0.0.0 love its DNS
 

913
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,750
gonna go through 10.0.0.0 love its DNS
requests so now if I jump over here and

914
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
requests so now if I jump over here and
 

915
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,550
requests so now if I jump over here and
just refresh this page as simple as that

916
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:24,560
just refresh this page as simple as that
 

917
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,100
just refresh this page as simple as that
the advertisement is blocked see that so

918
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,110
the advertisement is blocked see that so
 

919
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,460
the advertisement is blocked see that so
it tried to load it see how it's got a

920
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,470
it tried to load it see how it's got a
 

921
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,030
it tried to load it see how it's got a
placeholder it tried to access the ad

922
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,040
placeholder it tried to access the ad
 

923
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,770
placeholder it tried to access the ad
but it was blocked at the DNS level so

924
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:38,780
but it was blocked at the DNS level so
 

925
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,870
but it was blocked at the DNS level so
it never got to my browser how cool is

926
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:43,880
it never got to my browser how cool is
 

927
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,530
it never got to my browser how cool is
that so with this set up another thing

928
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:47,540
that so with this set up another thing
 

929
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,200
that so with this set up another thing
to keep in mind is that while your

930
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,210
to keep in mind is that while your
 

931
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,670
to keep in mind is that while your
mikrotik DHCP server is is going to dish

932
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:54,680
mikrotik DHCP server is is going to dish
 

933

my case you may have a situation where
somebody has

somebody has
 

939
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,220
somebody has
maybe a custom DNS setting on their

maybe a custom DNS setting on their

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,420
maybe a custom DNS setting on their

DNS settings that could be a problem
 

947
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,250
DNS settings that could be a problem
because this setting is not enforced so

948
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:21,260
because this setting is not enforced so
 

949
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,330
because this setting is not enforced so
this setting can easily be bypassed by

this setting can easily be bypassed by
 

951
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,690
this setting can easily be bypassed by
your device so by default your mikrotik

that download is the right term but it's

that download is the right term but it's
 

963
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,460
that download is the right term but it's
gonna get the new IP and DNS settings

964
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:42,470
gonna get the new IP and DNS settings
 

965
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,000
gonna get the new IP and DNS settings

but if your device has its own custom
 

969
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,960

971
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,410

so if you'd like to instead and force it

so if you'd like to instead and force it
so that even if there was an override on

card is fake because then what happens
 

2123
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:36,900
card is fake because then what happens
is you get to a certain point on the

2124
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:36,910
is you get to a certain point on the
 

2125
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,729
is you get to a certain point on the

areas of the card that don't actually
 

2129
00:47:40,749 --> 00:47:43,169
areas of the card that don't actually
exist because it's fake and then it will

2130
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:43,179
exist because it's fake and then it will
 

2131
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:45,359
exist because it's fake and then it will
crap out and you're gonna go into that

2132
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:45,369
crap out and you're gonna go into that
 

2133
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:47,020
crap out and you're gonna go into that

read-only state
 

2135
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,420
read-only state
so that's a possibility but if you are

2136
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:49,430
so that's a possibility but if you are
 

2137
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,980
so that's a possibility but if you are
confident that it's a good card and

00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:50,990
confident that it's a good card and
 

2139
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,530
confident that it's a good card and
you're pretty sure and you're absolutely

you're pretty sure and you're absolutely

you're pretty sure and you're absolutely
certain that it's not a fake because

00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:55,790
certain that it's not a fake because
 

2143
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,160
certain that it's not a fake because
that would definitely provide this

cards so from card to card there are

2164
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,170
cards so from card to card there are
 

2165
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,880
cards so from card to card there are
various things that will cause this to

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:24,890
various things that will cause this to
 

2167
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,550
various things that will cause this to
happen because that pine Book Pro is

2168
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:27,560
happen because that pine Book Pro is
 

2169
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,260
happen because that pine Book Pro is
trying to use it like it's a hard drive

2171
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:32,260
trying to use it like it's a hard drive
and some cards may be problematic

2172
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:32,270
and some cards may be problematic
 

2173
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,260
and some cards may be problematic
whereas another card will be perfectly

fine so try a different card try a

what what the next card behaves like but
 

2211
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,690
what what the next card behaves like but

it is that it's having trouble with that
card so if you've then rewritten the

2216
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520

2217
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,450
card so if you've then rewritten the
same card and tried again you're still

00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:40,460
same card and tried again you're still
 

2219
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,310
same card and tried again you're still
experiencing the same symptom because

00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:42,320
experiencing the same symptom because
 

2221
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
experiencing the same symptom because
it's the same card or if it's the same

2222
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:44,330
it's the same card or if it's the same
 

2223
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,080
it's the same card or if it's the same
brand and same product line maybe
