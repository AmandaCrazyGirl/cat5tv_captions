471
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,150
he's used through Google Play and his
phones he has access to but also because

way that is safe and so that was one of
 

495
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,220
way that is safe and so that was one of
the key components as we needed

496
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,230
the key components as we needed
 

497
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,630
the key components as we needed
something that was safe that wasn't

498
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:05,640
something that was safe that wasn't
 

499
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,310
something that was safe that wasn't

so he can start to learn now what his
 

647
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,790
so he can start to learn now what his
usage statistics are and some might

648
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:19,800
usage statistics are and some might
 

649
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,440
usage statistics are and some might
somebody think that sounds a little big

stuff that's spying on things and and
 

669
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,220
stuff that's spying on things and and
clipboards that get uploaded to various

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,230
clipboards that get uploaded to various
 

671
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,410
clipboards that get uploaded to various
servers and things like that so so it

672
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:45,420
servers and things like that so so it
 

673
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,389
servers and things like that so so it
can be scary yeah but what the nice

674
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:47,399
can be scary yeah but what the nice
 

675
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,670
can be scary yeah but what the nice
thing is because it's a a relatively

676
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
thing is because it's a a relatively
 

677
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,949
thing is because it's a a relatively
safe device yeah and because of that

678
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:53,959
safe device yeah and because of that
 

679
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,840
safe device yeah and because of that
parental input if having the email or

680
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:56,850
parental input if having the email or
 

681
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,509
parental input if having the email or
not I can teach him how to safely use

682
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
not I can teach him how to safely use
 

683
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,970
not I can teach him how to safely use
his computer oh I can you know and I've

684
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:01,980
his computer oh I can you know and I've
 

685
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,710
his computer oh I can you know and I've
taught him how to access you know like

686
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
taught him how to access you know like
 

687
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
taught him how to access you know like
all of his cross Google you know his

688
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,170
all of his cross Google you know his
 

689
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,840
all of his cross Google you know his
extensions his history all that kind of

690
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,850
extensions his history all that kind of
 

691
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,460
extensions his history all that kind of
stuff because it syncs it up so he's

692
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:13,470
stuff because it syncs it up so he's
 

693
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,220
stuff because it syncs it up so he's
like oh right because as soon as so he's

694
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,230
like oh right because as soon as so he's
 

695
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,720
like oh right because as soon as so he's
done something on his Chromebook and

696
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:17,730
done something on his Chromebook and
 

697
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,180
done something on his Chromebook and
then he can log into Chrome on the

698
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,190
then he can log into Chrome on the
 

699
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,069
then he can log into Chrome on the
family computer and suddenly he's got

700
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
family computer and suddenly he's got
 

701
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,170
family computer and suddenly he's got
access to all of his things that's right

702
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:24,180
access to all of his things that's right
 

703
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,150
access to all of his things that's right
so I'm starting to teach him in a safe

704
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
so I'm starting to teach him in a safe
 

705
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,180
so I'm starting to teach him in a safe
environment that you know sync nature

706
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,190
environment that you know sync nature
 

707
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,189
environment that you know sync nature
and the back-and-forth compatibility and

708
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
and the back-and-forth compatibility and
 

709
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,639
and the back-and-forth compatibility and
it's it's really fun as a dad being able

710
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:34,649
it's it's really fun as a dad being able
 

711
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:37,939
it's it's really fun as a dad being able
to watch my son go to the next level and

712
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:37,949
to watch my son go to the next level and
 

713
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:39,680
to watch my son go to the next level and
it's not just like you know when I was a

714
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:39,690
it's not just like you know when I was a
 

715
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,689
it's not just like you know when I was a
kid and it's like you get a computer and

716
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:41,699
kid and it's like you get a computer and
 

717
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,699
kid and it's like you get a computer and
you just do things for the sake of

718
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:43,709
you just do things for the sake of
 

719
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,380
you just do things for the sake of
learning it's like I'm actually working

720
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,390
learning it's like I'm actually working
 

721
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,090
learning it's like I'm actually working
him through it so that he understands it

722
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,100
him through it so that he understands it
 

723
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,509
him through it so that he understands it
has a better more mature outlook on what

724
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
has a better more mature outlook on what
 

725
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,949
has a better more mature outlook on what
he can do and what he should do and

726
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:51,959
he can do and what he should do and
 

727
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,170
he can do and what he should do and
shouldn't do and it's it's good

728
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,180
shouldn't do and it's it's good
 

729
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,600
shouldn't do and it's it's good
excellent yeah sounds like a great gift

730
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:56,610
excellent yeah sounds like a great gift
 

731
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,389
excellent yeah sounds like a great gift
so that's that's my story it's not shiny

732
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,399
so that's that's my story it's not shiny
 

733
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,730
so that's that's my story it's not shiny
it's not impressive but it's parenting

734
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:01,740
it's not impressive but it's parenting
 

735
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,310
it's not impressive but it's parenting
101 there you go very good what were you

736
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
101 there you go very good what were you
 

737
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,860
101 there you go very good what were you
well my first bit of tech that I'm

738
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:06,870
well my first bit of tech that I'm
 

739
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,509
well my first bit of tech that I'm
curious about right now and it's not

740
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:08,519
curious about right now and it's not
 

741
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,090
curious about right now and it's not
something that I have or can really get

742
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,100
something that I have or can really get
 

743
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,199
something that I have or can really get
started with is 3d printing ah you see

744
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:15,209
started with is 3d printing ah you see
 

745
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,130
started with is 3d printing ah you see
3d printers to me have for the longest

746
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,140
3d printers to me have for the longest
 

747
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,860
3d printers to me have for the longest
time being this kind of untouchable tech

748
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:21,870
time being this kind of untouchable tech
 

749
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,990
time being this kind of untouchable tech
mm-hmm and I've looked at them and I've

750
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
mm-hmm and I've looked at them and I've
 

751
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,300
mm-hmm and I've looked at them and I've
kind of kept an eye on them and wondered

752
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,310
kind of kept an eye on them and wondered
 

753
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,480
kind of kept an eye on them and wondered
about them but it seems so sci-fi to an

754
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:29,490
about them but it seems so sci-fi to an
 

755
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,460
about them but it seems so sci-fi to an
old-school tech guy like me to be able

756
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,470
old-school tech guy like me to be able
 

757
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,010
old-school tech guy like me to be able
to 3d print tools and 3d print things it

758
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,020
to 3d print tools and 3d print things it
 

759
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,449
to 3d print tools and 3d print things it
just sounds like something out of sci-fi

760
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:35,459
just sounds like something out of sci-fi
 

761
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,829
just sounds like something out of sci-fi
from

762
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:36,839
from
 

763
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,829
from
but it's a real tech now and the price

764
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
but it's a real tech now and the price
 

765
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,300
but it's a real tech now and the price
has come way down way down to the point

766
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,310
has come way down way down to the point
 

767
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,920
has come way down way down to the point
of unreasonable and I'll talk about that

768
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:45,930
of unreasonable and I'll talk about that
 

769
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,410
of unreasonable and I'll talk about that
a little bit but what really has pushed

770
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:48,420
a little bit but what really has pushed
 

771
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,639
a little bit but what really has pushed
me over the top

772
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:49,649
me over the top
 

773
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:56,329
me over the top
is seeing how some of my friends who are

is seeing how some of my friends who are
 

775
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,410
is seeing how some of my friends who are
into 3d printing technology are able to

776
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:00,420
into 3d printing technology are able to
 

777
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,400
into 3d printing technology are able to
do just that come up with an idea and

778
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,410
do just that come up with an idea and
 

779
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,579
do just that come up with an idea and
realize it and manufacture it yep and a

780
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:07,589
realize it and manufacture it yep and a
 

781
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,470
realize it and manufacture it yep and a
perfect example is right here at the

782
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:09,480
perfect example is right here at the
 

783
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,510
perfect example is right here at the
studio now Jeff you can see those at

784
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
studio now Jeff you can see those at
 

785
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,159
studio now Jeff you can see those at
home can't see but I've got all the

home can't see but I've got all the
 

787
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,230
home can't see but I've got all the
wires just going into a piece of PVC or

788

wires just going into a piece of PVC or
 

789
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,510
wires just going into a piece of PVC or
yes a piece of pipe yep and it goes

790
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
yes a piece of pipe yep and it goes
 

791
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,610
yes a piece of pipe yep and it goes
through a hole in the wall and it's

792
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:19,620
through a hole in the wall and it's
 

793
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,649
through a hole in the wall and it's
incredibly makeshift and it's terrible

794
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:21,659
incredibly makeshift and it's terrible
 

795
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:24,949
incredibly makeshift and it's terrible
right so I started talking with with

796
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
right so I started talking with with
 

797
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,350
right so I started talking with with
Bullock now ski from Ameritrade because

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
Bullock now ski from Ameritrade because
 

799
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,590
Bullock now ski from Ameritrade because
I knew that Bo does 3d printing and he's

800
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:30,600
I knew that Bo does 3d printing and he's
 

801
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,630
I knew that Bo does 3d printing and he's
into that kind of thing and he's like my

802
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
into that kind of thing and he's like my

that I said like what could I do

808
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
that I said like what could I do
 

809
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,140
that I said like what could I do
with this situation where I've got a

810
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,150
with this situation where I've got a
 

811
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,570
with this situation where I've got a
wall that's like this thick and it's

812
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:44,580
wall that's like this thick and it's
 

813
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,399
wall that's like this thick and it's
just drywall and I've drilled a hole in

814
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:46,409
just drywall and I've drilled a hole in
 

815
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,169
just drywall and I've drilled a hole in
it but now I've got a piece of pipe

816
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:48,179
it but now I've got a piece of pipe
 

817
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,060
it but now I've got a piece of pipe
going through and it looks terrible and

818
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,070
going through and it looks terrible and
 

819
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,250
going through and it looks terrible and
it's not it totally looks makeshift

820
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:52,260
it's not it totally looks makeshift
 

821
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,130
it's not it totally looks makeshift
right and I can't get a contractor in to

822
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,140
right and I can't get a contractor in to
 

823
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,110
right and I can't get a contractor in to
build something and if I did it's gonna

824
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
build something and if I did it's gonna
 

825
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
build something and if I did it's gonna
cost $200 if not more

826
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,330
cost $200 if not more
 

827
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,149
cost $200 if not more
just to have a proper conduit per in

828
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:02,159
just to have a proper conduit per in
 

829
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,430
just to have a proper conduit per in
which is crazy when you think about that

830
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,440
which is crazy when you think about that
 

831
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,549
which is crazy when you think about that
it's it's a lot of money and so Bo and I

832
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:07,559
it's it's a lot of money and so Bo and I
 

833
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,100
it's it's a lot of money and so Bo and I
got talking about it and and and working

834
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,110
got talking about it and and and working
 

835
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,830
got talking about it and and and working
on some ideas and kind of back and forth

836
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
on some ideas and kind of back and forth
 

837
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,180
on some ideas and kind of back and forth
and he came up with a design for

838
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,190
and he came up with a design for
 

839
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,890
and he came up with a design for
something that he's calling ez portal

840
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:18,900
something that he's calling ez portal
 

841
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,710
something that he's calling ez portal
and this is basically if you can picture

842
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:21,720
and this is basically if you can picture
 

843
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,470
and this is basically if you can picture
two pieces of pipe that are each about

844
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
two pieces of pipe that are each about
 

845
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,230
two pieces of pipe that are each about
this long and they screw into one

846
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,240
this long and they screw into one
 

847
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,750
this long and they screw into one
another okay but they have a flange on

848
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
another okay but they have a flange on
 

849
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
another okay but they have a flange on
both sides so with and he designed this

850
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:32,970
both sides so with and he designed this
 

851
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,520
both sides so with and he designed this
and he's actually printed one and I'm

852
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:34,530
and he's actually printed one and I'm
 

853
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,490
and he's actually printed one and I'm
and I'm hoping to receive one soon I

854
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,500
and I'm hoping to receive one soon I
 

855
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,880
and I'm hoping to receive one soon I
think it's in the mail but you put one

856
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:40,890
think it's in the mail but you put one
 

857
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,950
think it's in the mail but you put one
piece on one side one piece on the other

858
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
piece on one side one piece on the other
 

859
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,899
piece on one side one piece on the other
side and you know I guess I'll get

860
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:44,909
side and you know I guess I'll get
 

861
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,399
side and you know I guess I'll get
somebody on the other side to twist on

862
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,409
somebody on the other side to twist on
 

863
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:47,960
somebody on the other side to twist on
that side right and you twist it

864
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:47,970
that side right and you twist it
 

865
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,760
that side right and you twist it
together and it screws in together and

866
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:49,770
together and it screws in together and
 

867
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,090
together and it screws in together and
it's

868
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,100
it's
 

869
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,490
it's
flush and it's tight and it's a perfect

870
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:52,500
flush and it's tight and it's a perfect
 

871
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,230
flush and it's tight and it's a perfect
conduit with a nice little flange Wow

872
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
conduit with a nice little flange Wow
 

873
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,600
conduit with a nice little flange Wow
beautiful so he calls it easy portal you

874
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,610
beautiful so he calls it easy portal you
 

875
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,169
beautiful so he calls it easy portal you
can actually see it on Miriam and just

876
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:00,179
can actually see it on Miriam and just
 

877
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,850
can actually see it on Miriam and just
do a quick search for easy portal and

878
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:01,860
do a quick search for easy portal and
 

879
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,930
do a quick search for easy portal and
and that to me Jeff made me think okay

880
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:05,940
and that to me Jeff made me think okay
 

881
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,779
and that to me Jeff made me think okay
so if I just if I could do that instead

882
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:08,789
so if I just if I could do that instead
 

883
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,120
so if I just if I could do that instead
of paying $200 to a contractor to build

884
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,130
of paying $200 to a contractor to build
 

885
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,020
of paying $200 to a contractor to build
a proper portal something through the

886
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,030
a proper portal something through the
 

887
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,810
a proper portal something through the
wall that starts to make a little bit of

888
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:17,820
wall that starts to make a little bit of
 

889
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,090
wall that starts to make a little bit of
sense but it's still beyond me it's

890
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,100
sense but it's still beyond me it's
 

891
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,820
sense but it's still beyond me it's
still well beyond me know he would have

892
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:22,830
still well beyond me know he would have
 

893
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,210
still well beyond me know he would have
more of a a robust 3d printer wouldn't

894
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:26,220
more of a a robust 3d printer wouldn't
 

895
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,760
more of a a robust 3d printer wouldn't
be like a little tabletop you know right

896
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:27,770
be like a little tabletop you know right
 

897
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,960
be like a little tabletop you know right
well I don't know I mean I asked him

898
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:29,970
well I don't know I mean I asked him
 

899
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,669
well I don't know I mean I asked him
what kind of printers he's using and

900
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
what kind of printers he's using and
 

901
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,700
what kind of printers he's using and
he's got an ender 3 okay he's got you

902

he's got an ender 3 okay he's got you
 

903
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,919
he's got an ender 3 okay he's got you
know the the standard kind of you know

904
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:36,929
know the the standard kind of you know
 

905
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:39,020
know the the standard kind of you know
what we would call a consumer 3d printer

906
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,030
what we would call a consumer 3d printer
 

907
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,120
what we would call a consumer 3d printer
and he's got he's got some that are a

908
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,130
and he's got he's got some that are a
 

909
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,980
and he's got he's got some that are a
little higher end as well hmm

910
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:42,990
little higher end as well hmm
 

911
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,710
little higher end as well hmm
a little higher end I was like no it's

912
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:45,720
a little higher end I was like no it's
 

913
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,020
a little higher end I was like no it's
way higher end yeah yeah I'm still

914
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,030
way higher end yeah yeah I'm still
 

915
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,370
way higher end yeah yeah I'm still
learning the industry prints human

916
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:49,380
learning the industry prints human
 

917
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,659
learning the industry prints human
beings so and if that's common well we

918
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:53,669
beings so and if that's common well we
 

919
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,500
beings so and if that's common well we
could 3d print body parts now yeah so

920
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:57,510
could 3d print body parts now yeah so
 

921
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,289
could 3d print body parts now yeah so
here here's where my thought processes

922
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:00,299
here here's where my thought processes
 

923
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,659
here here's where my thought processes
go Jeff is I start to look at this wall

924
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:02,669
go Jeff is I start to look at this wall
 

925

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:04,890
and so we need to get the signage done
 

927
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,580
and so we need to get the signage done
right and so I've got a sign person

928
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:07,590
right and so I've got a sign person
 

929
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,230
right and so I've got a sign person
who's telling me 300 dollars to do the

930
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,240
who's telling me 300 dollars to do the
 

931
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,850
who's telling me 300 dollars to do the
sign so you can think you can 3d print

932
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:10,860
sign so you can think you can 3d print
 

933
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,419
sign so you can think you can 3d print
the cat5 logo I start to think that I

934
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:13,429
the cat5 logo I start to think that I
 

935
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:17,330
the cat5 logo I start to think that I
start to think okay could I and then you

936
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:17,340
start to think okay could I and then you
 

937
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,039
start to think okay could I and then you
start to look at 3d printers and you

938
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,049
start to look at 3d printers and you
 

939
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,080
start to look at 3d printers and you
realize that you know for $500 you can

940
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,090
realize that you know for $500 you can
 

941
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,770
realize that you know for $500 you can
get a high end like a decent consumer 3d

942
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:24,780
get a high end like a decent consumer 3d
 

943
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,570
get a high end like a decent consumer 3d
printer and that's on the high end you

944
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:26,580
printer and that's on the high end you
 

945
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,730
printer and that's on the high end you
can get them for 300 that's true

946
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:28,740
can get them for 300 that's true
 

947
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,640
can get them for 300 that's true
I keep looking at them on yeah different

955
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,320
because is that's me too uh to me a like
a 3d printer I don't think I have a

956
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,330
a 3d printer I don't think I have a
 

957
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,870
a 3d printer I don't think I have a
legitimate need for it whole Nakhla but

958
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:47,880
legitimate need for it whole Nakhla but
 

959
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,810
legitimate need for it whole Nakhla but
at the same time I've thought about

960
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:50,820
at the same time I've thought about
 

961
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,700
at the same time I've thought about
getting a 3d printer for the sake of

962
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:52,710
getting a 3d printer for the sake of
 

963
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,390
getting a 3d printer for the sake of
printing LEGO pieces I don't know if

964
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
printing LEGO pieces I don't know if
 

965
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
printing LEGO pieces I don't know if
that's even a copyright thing probably

966
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,169
that's even a copyright thing probably
 

967
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,590
that's even a copyright thing probably
but a lot of times my seen them on

968
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:00,600
but a lot of times my seen them on
 

969
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,750
but a lot of times my seen them on
Thingiverse

970
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
Thingiverse
 

971
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,480
Thingiverse
I mean my butt like everyone so on my

972
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,490
I mean my butt like everyone so on my
 

973
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,490
I mean my butt like everyone so on my
kids will break a brick okay and it's

974
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:06,500
kids will break a brick okay and it's
 

975
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,370
kids will break a brick okay and it's
like and they cost a lot of money it's

976
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:09,380
like and they cost a lot of money it's
 

977
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,170
like and they cost a lot of money it's
insane you know but if I could just

978
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:11,180
insane you know but if I could just
 

979
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,240
insane you know but if I could just
print that that you know that's a pretty

980
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,250
print that that you know that's a pretty
 

981
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,030
print that that you know that's a pretty
basic use case but for me I'm thinking

982
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,040
basic use case but for me I'm thinking
 

983
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,890
basic use case but for me I'm thinking
like can I offset expense mmm by

984
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:20,900
like can I offset expense mmm by
 

985
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,530
like can I offset expense mmm by
printing something myself can I justify

986
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:23,540
printing something myself can I justify
 

987
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,530
printing something myself can I justify
the expense of a 3d printer and learn

988
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:26,540
the expense of a 3d printer and learn
 

989
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,030
the expense of a 3d printer and learn
and the time that it takes to learn how

990
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,040
and the time that it takes to learn how
 

991
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,700
and the time that it takes to learn how
to do it in such a way that I'm actually

992
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:30,710
to do it in such a way that I'm actually
 

993
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,420
to do it in such a way that I'm actually
saving money that's the signage yeah

994
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,430
saving money that's the signage yeah
 

995
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,190
saving money that's the signage yeah
it's to make it look that way I bet you

996
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,200
it's to make it look that way I bet you
 

997
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,300
it's to make it look that way I bet you
probably could and now what okay for the

998
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,310
probably could and now what okay for the
 

999
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,410
probably could and now what okay for the
life of me I'm blanking on the name of

1000
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:41,420
life of me I'm blanking on the name of
 

1001
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,110
life of me I'm blanking on the name of
the unit but there's a tabletop 3d

1002
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,120
the unit but there's a tabletop 3d
 

1003
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,730
the unit but there's a tabletop 3d
printer that I was looking at there are

1004
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:45,740
printer that I was looking at there are
 

1005
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,380
printer that I was looking at there are
so many Jeff well these days they're

1006
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:47,390
so many Jeff well these days they're
 

1007
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,580
so many Jeff well these days they're
easy but not only is it a 3d printer

1008
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:50,590
easy but not only is it a 3d printer
 

1009
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,520
easy but not only is it a 3d printer
it's also a laser engraver yeah yeah

1010
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:54,530
it's also a laser engraver yeah yeah
 

1011
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,860
it's also a laser engraver yeah yeah
I've seen though and there was something

1012
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:56,870
I've seen though and there was something
 

1013
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,910
I've seen though and there was something
else it did and now you're getting

1014
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:57,920
else it did and now you're getting
 

1015
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,410
else it did and now you're getting
serious and I was loving aren't those

1016
00:21:59,410 --> 00:21:59,420
serious and I was loving aren't those
 

1017
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,090
serious and I was loving aren't those
thousands it was it was 29 yeah so and I

1018
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,100
thousands it was it was 29 yeah so and I
 

1019
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,880
thousands it was it was 29 yeah so and I
was like oh I could come up with

1020
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:06,890
was like oh I could come up with
 

1021
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,410
was like oh I could come up with
something for that

1022
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:08,420
something for that
 

1023
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,510
something for that
so maybe what I what I would look at

1024
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:10,520
so maybe what I what I would look at
 

1025
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,340
so maybe what I what I would look at
then in that case is I would say okay

1026
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,350
then in that case is I would say okay
 

1027
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,410
then in that case is I would say okay
would would I start with something

1028
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:14,420
would would I start with something
 

1029
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,170
would would I start with something
that's 300 and and see how I do and see

1030
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,180
that's 300 and and see how I do and see
 

1031
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,050
that's 300 and and see how I do and see
if I can offset cost which is virtually

1032
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,060
if I can offset cost which is virtually
 

1033
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,600
if I can offset cost which is virtually
making money and then and then upgrade

1034
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:22,610
making money and then and then upgrade
 

1035
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,180
making money and then and then upgrade
if I need to or if I can justify that or

1036
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,190
if I need to or if I can justify that or
 

1037
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,460
if I need to or if I can justify that or
I think you should just say hey if

1038
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:27,470
I think you should just say hey if
 

1039
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,170
I think you should just say hey if
somebody buys you that unit you'll go

1040
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,180
somebody buys you that unit you'll go
 

1041
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:37,540
somebody buys you that unit you'll go
through labor with me no that's all on

1042
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:37,550
through labor with me no that's all on
 

1043
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:43,210
through labor with me no that's all on
you Jeff I looked at a 1u mounting

1044
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,220
you Jeff I looked at a 1u mounting
 

1045
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,700
you Jeff I looked at a 1u mounting
system because I want to rackmount some

1046
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:45,710
system because I want to rackmount some
 

1047
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,230
system because I want to rackmount some
single board computers right and you're

1048
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,240
single board computers right and you're
 

1049
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,940
single board computers right and you're
looking a couple hundred bucks yeah a

1050
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:48,950
looking a couple hundred bucks yeah a
 

1051
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,980
looking a couple hundred bucks yeah a
little server case to be able to put my

1052
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:50,990
little server case to be able to put my
 

1053
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,480
little server case to be able to put my
single board computers on the server

1054
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,490
single board computers on the server
 

1055
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,790
single board computers on the server
rack and then I got unto the Thingiverse

1056
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:54,800
rack and then I got unto the Thingiverse
 

1057
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,920
rack and then I got unto the Thingiverse
and I started looking and I could print

1058
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:56,930
and I started looking and I could print
 

1059
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,440
and I started looking and I could print
one mm-hm

1060
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,450
one mm-hm
 

1061
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,630
one mm-hm
my approach has been so I haven't bought

1062
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:01,640
my approach has been so I haven't bought
 

1063
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,710
my approach has been so I haven't bought
a 3d printer I don't have one but I

1064
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
a 3d printer I don't have one but I
 

1065
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,420
a 3d printer I don't have one but I
decided okay I'm gonna see if because

1066
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,430
decided okay I'm gonna see if because
 

1067
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,340
decided okay I'm gonna see if because
this is this is what I fall into I'll

1068
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:09,350
this is this is what I fall into I'll
 

1069
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,250
this is this is what I fall into I'll
buy things thinking that oh yeah I'm

1070
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,260
buy things thinking that oh yeah I'm
 

1071
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,630
buy things thinking that oh yeah I'm
gonna use that I'm gonna it's gonna

1072
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:13,640
gonna use that I'm gonna it's gonna
 

1073
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,670
gonna use that I'm gonna it's gonna
offset my cost and blah blah blah

1074
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:15,680
offset my cost and blah blah blah
 

1075
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,140
offset my cost and blah blah blah
but then I find that the learning curve

1076
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,150
but then I find that the learning curve
 

1077
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,060
but then I find that the learning curve
is too high so what I've been doing is

1078
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,070
is too high so what I've been doing is
 

1079
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,950
is too high so what I've been doing is
I've been going on to Tinkercad comm and

1080
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
I've been going on to Tinkercad comm and
 

1081
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,010
I've been going on to Tinkercad comm and
I've been doing my first designs uh-huh

1082
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,020
I've been doing my first designs uh-huh
 

1083
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,080
I've been doing my first designs uh-huh
and so I actually have four designs

1084
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,090
and so I actually have four designs
 

1085
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,090
and so I actually have four designs
already up including the category-five

1086
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,100
already up including the category-five
 

1087

Thingiverse account bald nerd mm-hmm so
you can see the designs including a

1092
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:35,870
you can see the designs including a
 

1093
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,780
you can see the designs including a
little case for a Raspberry Pi to be

1094
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:37,790
little case for a Raspberry Pi to be
 

1095
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,930
little case for a Raspberry Pi to be
able to mount it on my won-won you serve

1096
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:40,940
able to mount it on my won-won you serve
 

1097
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,870
able to mount it on my won-won you serve
a rec 19-inch server rack so so I'm

1098
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:43,880
a rec 19-inch server rack so so I'm
 

1099
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,690
a rec 19-inch server rack so so I'm
doing the designs first to see how how

1100
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:46,700
doing the designs first to see how how
 

1101
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,630
doing the designs first to see how how
onerous it is right finger out can I can

1102
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:49,640
onerous it is right finger out can I can
 

1103
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,210
onerous it is right finger out can I can
I actually do this and then I can start

1104
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,220
I actually do this and then I can start
 

1105
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,830
I actually do this and then I can start
to look at okay if the sign is gonna be

1106
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
to look at okay if the sign is gonna be
 

1107
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,320
to look at okay if the sign is gonna be
300 how much would it cost to print does

1108
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,330
300 how much would it cost to print does
 

1109
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,030

it have that kind of estimator online

1110
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,040
it have that kind of estimator online
 

1111
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,270
it have that kind of estimator online
when you come up yeah yeah okay in in

1112
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,280
when you come up yeah yeah okay in in
 

1113
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,130
when you come up yeah yeah okay in in
the software you can you can actually

1114
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,140
the software you can you can actually
 

1115
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,560
the software you can you can actually
see how long it's going to take and how

1116
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:08,570
see how long it's going to take and how
 

1117
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,310
see how long it's going to take and how
much how much filament it's going to use

1118
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
much how much filament it's going to use
 

1119
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,010
much how much filament it's going to use
so there are all those things so I'm

1120
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,020
so there are all those things so I'm
 

1121
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,750
so there are all those things so I'm
starting to look at that and I'm really

1122
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:16,760
starting to look at that and I'm really
 

1123
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,640
starting to look at that and I'm really
really curious and I'd love to know what

1124
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:18,650
really curious and I'd love to know what
 

1125
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,130
really curious and I'd love to know what
you think and you know is there a really

1126
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:21,140
you think and you know is there a really
 

1127
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,530
you think and you know is there a really
that that point where the price has come

1128
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:23,540
that that point where the price has come
 

1129
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,870
that that point where the price has come
down far enough on 3d printers that it

1130
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:25,880
down far enough on 3d printers that it
 

1131
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,240
down far enough on 3d printers that it
now makes sense to have one right in you

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,250
now makes sense to have one right in you
 

1133

was a pretty cool 3d printing by the way
 

1173
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,659
was a pretty cool 3d printing by the way
okay so my other tech thing is in

1174
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:36,669
okay so my other tech thing is in
 

1175
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,210
okay so my other tech thing is in
relation a little bit to what my first

1176
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:39,220
relation a little bit to what my first
 

1177

1226
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:48,340
access to it they can have you know give
 

1227
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,669
access to it they can have you know give
the login to their friends it'll be

1228
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:50,679
the login to their friends it'll be
 

1229
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,350
the login to their friends it'll be
behind those security features of our

1230
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:52,360
behind those security features of our
 

1231
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,919
behind those security features of our
network so it's safe and secure that way

1232
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:54,929
network so it's safe and secure that way
 

1233
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,450
network so it's safe and secure that way
so you get to select who joins the

1234
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:57,460
so you get to select who joins the
 

1235
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,970
so you get to select who joins the
server yeah but also because it has the

1236
00:26:59,970 --> 00:26:59,980
server yeah but also because it has the
 

1237
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,880
server yeah but also because it has the
ability to do the Pocket Edition server

1238
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:01,890
ability to do the Pocket Edition server
 

1239
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,409
ability to do the Pocket Edition server
it means that on their phones they can

1240
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:04,419
it means that on their phones they can
 

1241
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:07,680
it means that on their phones they can
also stay connected oh nice so now so

1242
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:07,690
also stay connected oh nice so now so
 

1243
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,060
also stay connected oh nice so now so
that's what I'm working on at home the

1244
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,070
that's what I'm working on at home the
 

1245
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,769
that's what I'm working on at home the
the software is installed I'm just

1246
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:10,779
the software is installed I'm just
 

1247
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,080
the software is installed I'm just
configuring it yeah I wasn't sure how it

1248
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,090
configuring it yeah I wasn't sure how it
 

1249
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,899
configuring it yeah I wasn't sure how it
would run on the Raspberry Pi because

1250
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:15,909
would run on the Raspberry Pi because
 

1251
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:17,970
would run on the Raspberry Pi because
that's what that's immediately what's

1252
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:17,980
that's what that's immediately what's
 

1253
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,539
that's what that's immediately what's
coming to mind cuz I'm like okay Raz

1254
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:19,549
coming to mind cuz I'm like okay Raz
 

1255
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,799
coming to mind cuz I'm like okay Raz
great pie unless you've got a four

1256
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:20,809
great pie unless you've got a four
 

1257
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,739
great pie unless you've got a four
you're dealing with one gig no Ram it's

1258
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:23,749
you're dealing with one gig no Ram it's
 

1259
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:27,609
you're dealing with one gig no Ram it's
a it's a 3 B plus and I fought for sure

1260
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:27,619
a it's a 3 B plus and I fought for sure
 

1261
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:30,279
a it's a 3 B plus and I fought for sure
it would be lagging yeah but it's not

1262
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:30,289
it would be lagging yeah but it's not
 

1263
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,369
it would be lagging yeah but it's not
what about world Jen so if you fly

1264
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:33,379
what about world Jen so if you fly
 

1265
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:36,820
what about world Jen so if you fly
across the world is it is it I haven't

1266
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:36,830
across the world is it is it I haven't
 

1267
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,409
across the world is it is it I haven't
got I haven't gotten that far yet okay

1268
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:38,419
got I haven't gotten that far yet okay
 

1269
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:41,649
got I haven't gotten that far yet okay
so like I'm just I'm working through the

1270
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:41,659
so like I'm just I'm working through the
 

1271
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,359
so like I'm just I'm working through the
process of setting it up but as far as

1272
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:43,369
process of setting it up but as far as
 

1273
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,999
process of setting it up but as far as
running it on the on the pie it runs

1274
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:46,009
running it on the on the pie it runs
 

1275
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,279
running it on the on the pie it runs
okay there doesn't seem to be any server

1276
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:48,289
okay there doesn't seem to be any server
 

1277
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,549
okay there doesn't seem to be any server
like with one of us joining yeah it'll

1278
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:51,559
like with one of us joining yeah it'll
 

1279
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,039
like with one of us joining yeah it'll
be you know the true test will be when

1280
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,049
be you know the true test will be when
 

1281
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,289
be you know the true test will be when
we add four five six people oh yes

1282
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:56,299
we add four five six people oh yes
 

1283
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,999
we add four five six people oh yes
lovely logging oh yeah see how it goes

1284
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:58,009
lovely logging oh yeah see how it goes
 

1285
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,460
lovely logging oh yeah see how it goes
but I was gonna do it with my Audrey

1286
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,470
but I was gonna do it with my Audrey
 

1287
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,359
but I was gonna do it with my Audrey
yeah that was an X for ya yeah yeah but

1288
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:04,369
yeah that was an X for ya yeah yeah but
 

1289
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,460
yeah that was an X for ya yeah yeah but
I decided to give it a try with the

1290
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:06,470
I decided to give it a try with the
 

1291
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,169
I decided to give it a try with the
Raspberry Pi just because of the the

1292
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:08,179
Raspberry Pi just because of the the
 

1293
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:10,509
Raspberry Pi just because of the the
power usage yeah it's a little bit lower

1294
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:10,519
power usage yeah it's a little bit lower
 

1295
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,460
power usage yeah it's a little bit lower
and I had an extra PI kick it around

1296
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:12,470
and I had an extra PI kick it around
 

1297
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,889
and I had an extra PI kick it around
okay so yeah that's that's the project

1298
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:14,899
okay so yeah that's that's the project
 

1299
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:16,239
okay so yeah that's that's the project
that I'm working on right now and and

1300
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:16,249
that I'm working on right now and and
 

1301
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:19,330
that I'm working on right now and and
and if it works and it runs well then

1302
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:19,340
and if it works and it runs well then
 

1303
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,009
and if it works and it runs well then
maybe we'll do it as a feature for the

1304
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:21,019
maybe we'll do it as a feature for the
 

1305
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:22,180
maybe we'll do it as a feature for the
show that would be awesome

1306
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,190
show that would be awesome
 

1307
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,830
show that would be awesome
so PI 3 B+ is limited to one gig of ram

1308
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:26,840
so PI 3 B+ is limited to one gig of ram
 

1309
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,070
so PI 3 B+ is limited to one gig of ram
versus an xu 4 which has two gigs of ram

1310
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
versus an xu 4 which has two gigs of ram
 

1311
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,859
versus an xu 4 which has two gigs of ram
right the 3b plus also is limited to an

1312
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:32,869
right the 3b plus also is limited to an
 

1313
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:35,109
right the 3b plus also is limited to an
SD card which is shared on the USB bus

1314
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:35,119
SD card which is shared on the USB bus
 

1315
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,440
SD card which is shared on the USB bus
so it's a little bit slow yeah whereas

1316
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,450
so it's a little bit slow yeah whereas
 

1317
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,289
so it's a little bit slow yeah whereas
the xu 4 has the MMC yes so I think if

1318
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:41,299
the xu 4 has the MMC yes so I think if
 

1319
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,409
the xu 4 has the MMC yes so I think if
you have like a latent like not latency

1320
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:44,419
you have like a latent like not latency
 

1321
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:47,769
you have like a latent like not latency
but issues with world gen I think maybe

1322
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:47,779
but issues with world gen I think maybe
 

1323
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,859
but issues with world gen I think maybe
the Xu form might resolve that but also

1324
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:50,869
the Xu form might resolve that but also
 

1325
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:55,269
the Xu form might resolve that but also
if you wanted to upgrade to a PI for you

1326
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
if you wanted to upgrade to a PI for you
 

1327
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,279
if you wanted to upgrade to a PI for you
can get up to 8 gigs of ram I thought

1328
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:57,289
can get up to 8 gigs of ram I thought
 

1329
00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:59,379
can get up to 8 gigs of ram I thought
about that yeah see I just had my

1330
00:28:59,379 --> 00:28:59,389
about that yeah see I just had my
 

1331
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,149
about that yeah see I just had my
birthday last week and the great thing

I'll post the links below but with
 

1369
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,690
I'll post the links below but with
Valena minecraft they've optimized it to

1370
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:52,700
Valena minecraft they've optimized it to
 

1371
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,549
Valena minecraft they've optimized it to
to run as well as can be this is

1372
00:29:57,549 --> 00:29:57,559
to run as well as can be this is
 

1373

00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:00,529
minecraft minecraft or or 30 pi it's a
 

1375
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:03,820
minecraft minecraft or or 30 pi it's a
server for Raspberry Pi now but they do

1376
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:03,830
server for Raspberry Pi now but they do
 

1377
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,210
server for Raspberry Pi now but they do
warn that one gig of ram you're gonna

1378
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:07,220
warn that one gig of ram you're gonna
 

1379
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,039
warn that one gig of ram you're gonna
have trouble yeah and I think that's

1380
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,049
have trouble yeah and I think that's
 

1381
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,049
have trouble yeah and I think that's
what you'll encounter because the the

1382
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:11,059
what you'll encounter because the the
 

1383
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,690
what you'll encounter because the the
fear that I have with a 3 B plus is the

1384
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:13,700
fear that I have with a 3 B plus is the
 

1385
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,950
fear that I have with a 3 B plus is the
minimum system requirements for

1386
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
minimum system requirements for
 

1387
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,830
minimum system requirements for
minecraft as a server is one gig right

1388
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
minecraft as a server is one gig right
 

1389
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,889
minecraft as a server is one gig right
well if you only have one gig where's

1390
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:20,899
well if you only have one gig where's
 

1391
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,840
well if you only have one gig where's
the overhead for your operating system

1392
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:22,850
the overhead for your operating system
 

1393
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,970
the overhead for your operating system
when everything else is running right so

1394
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:24,980
when everything else is running right so
 

1395
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,909
when everything else is running right so
that's where the the PI 4 comes in with

1396
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
that's where the the PI 4 comes in with
 

1397
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,610
that's where the the PI 4 comes in with
eight gigs around yes yeah oh yeah I

1398
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:30,620
eight gigs around yes yeah oh yeah I
 

1399
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,720
eight gigs around yes yeah oh yeah I
wanted to try it on the Raspberry Pi

1400
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:31,730
wanted to try it on the Raspberry Pi
 

1401
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,029
wanted to try it on the Raspberry Pi
even worked but if it doesn't work out

1402
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:34,039
even worked but if it doesn't work out
 

1403
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,279
even worked but if it doesn't work out
then I'll go to the xu 4 and maybe I'll

1404
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:36,289
then I'll go to the xu 4 and maybe I'll
 

1405
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:37,539
then I'll go to the xu 4 and maybe I'll
spend that birthday money it's just

1406
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:37,549
spend that birthday money it's just
 

1407
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:40,000
spend that birthday money it's just
maybe I four and then get an argon one

1408
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,010
maybe I four and then get an argon one
 

1409
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,360
maybe I four and then get an argon one
yeah I'm telling you it's awesome it's

1410
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,370
yeah I'm telling you it's awesome it's
 

1411
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,250
yeah I'm telling you it's awesome it's
like possibilities it's good what do you

1412
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,260
like possibilities it's good what do you
 

1413
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,500
like possibilities it's good what do you
guys think give him a thumbs up well

1414
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:50,510
guys think give him a thumbs up well
 

1415
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,680
guys think give him a thumbs up well
yeah my turn it's your turn let's see if

1416
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:53,690
yeah my turn it's your turn let's see if
 

1417
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,690
yeah my turn it's your turn let's see if
you can bring us home for a clear solid

1418
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:55,700
you can bring us home for a clear solid
 

1419
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,190
you can bring us home for a clear solid
win do you guys notice these lights

1420
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
win do you guys notice these lights
 

1421
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,029
win do you guys notice these lights
behind us yes they don't see the lights

1422
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
behind us yes they don't see the lights
 

1423
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,889
behind us yes they don't see the lights
but they see probably a little right so

1424
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:02,899
but they see probably a little right so
 

1425
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,720
but they see probably a little right so
you see the glow behind me and the glow

1426
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:04,730
you see the glow behind me and the glow
 

1427
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,880
you see the glow behind me and the glow
behind you hair

1428
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:05,890
behind you hair
 

1429
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:12,269
behind you hair
those are DMX lights not the rapper

1430
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:12,279

 

1431
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,519

what's neat about so I've got we've got

1432
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:15,529
what's neat about so I've got we've got
 

1433
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:17,560
what's neat about so I've got we've got
LED lights all around us here at the

1434
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:17,570
LED lights all around us here at the
 

1435
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,690
LED lights all around us here at the
studio to illuminate us hmm

1436
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:19,700
studio to illuminate us hmm
 

1437
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,799
studio to illuminate us hmm
and Jeff you can see them yep and they

1438
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:23,809
and Jeff you can see them yep and they
 

1439
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,659
and Jeff you can see them yep and they
just plug in you turn them on and

1440
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:25,669
just plug in you turn them on and
 

1441
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,700
just plug in you turn them on and
they're significantly smaller in size

1442
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:27,710
they're significantly smaller in size
 

1443
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,149
they're significantly smaller in size
than the goblins yeah yeah now we've got

1444
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:31,159
than the goblins yeah yeah now we've got
 

1445
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:32,680
than the goblins yeah yeah now we've got
all these soft boxes that I gotta sell

1446
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:32,690
all these soft boxes that I gotta sell
 

1447
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,299
all these soft boxes that I gotta sell
cuz like what do you do with them when

1448
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:34,309
cuz like what do you do with them when
 

1449
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,680
cuz like what do you do with them when
you've got all these nice little LEDs

1450
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:35,690
you've got all these nice little LEDs
 

1451
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,779
you've got all these nice little LEDs
right but the LED panels that we use are

1452
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:37,789
right but the LED panels that we use are
 

1453
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:39,669
right but the LED panels that we use are
just plug and play you plug in the power

1454
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
just plug and play you plug in the power
 

1455
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,139
just plug and play you plug in the power
and turn it on

1456
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:41,149
and turn it on
 

1457
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,899
and turn it on
DMX on the other hand gives us a whole

1458
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:43,909
DMX on the other hand gives us a whole
 

1459
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:46,570
DMX on the other hand gives us a whole
new realm for lighting in that you can

1460
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:46,580
new realm for lighting in that you can
 

1461
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,399
new realm for lighting in that you can
control all of the lights from a

1462
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:48,409
control all of the lights from a
 

1463
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:51,430
control all of the lights from a
controller okay and when I say a

1464
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
controller okay and when I say a
 

1465
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,700
controller okay and when I say a
controller so these lights behind us are

1466
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:53,710
controller so these lights behind us are
 

1467
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,700
controller so these lights behind us are
actually running through oh my goodness

1468
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:57,710
actually running through oh my goodness
 

1469
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,789
actually running through oh my goodness
what appears like a mixer yeah right so

1470
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
what appears like a mixer yeah right so
 

1471
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,289
what appears like a mixer yeah right so
like I can boost Roby yeah do do all

1472
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:05,299
like I can boost Roby yeah do do all
 

1473
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,119
like I can boost Roby yeah do do all
kinds of changes we can I can change the

1474
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:07,129
kinds of changes we can I can change the
 

1475
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:10,599
kinds of changes we can I can change the
color so these are the this is the RG oh

1476
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:10,609
color so these are the this is the RG oh
 

1477
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:12,310
color so these are the this is the RG oh
that's the brightness and then I've got

1478
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,320
that's the brightness and then I've got
 

1479
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,669
that's the brightness and then I've got
red green blue yep so I can actually

1480
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
red green blue yep so I can actually
 

1481
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,259
red green blue yep so I can actually
change that got a bit of a purple going

1482
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:17,269
change that got a bit of a purple going
 

1483
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,159
change that got a bit of a purple going
on so this is pretty neat but again this

1484
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:21,169
on so this is pretty neat but again this
 

1485
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:23,079
on so this is pretty neat but again this
is one of those technologies that always

1486
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:23,089
is one of those technologies that always
 

1487
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:25,060
is one of those technologies that always
thought it would be ultra expensive but

1488
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,070
thought it would be ultra expensive but
 

1489
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,619
thought it would be ultra expensive but
it was a pretty cheap so yeah they are

1490
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:26,629
it was a pretty cheap so yeah they are
 

1491
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:29,349
it was a pretty cheap so yeah they are
very cheap so but that blew my mind

1492
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:29,359
very cheap so but that blew my mind
 

1493
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,499
very cheap so but that blew my mind
because I needed to buy two lights for

1494
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:32,509
because I needed to buy two lights for
 

1495
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:33,129
because I needed to buy two lights for
the studio

1496
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:33,139
the studio
 

1497
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:37,060
the studio
well this with eight lights was cheaper

1498
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,070
well this with eight lights was cheaper
 

1499
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,519
well this with eight lights was cheaper
than those two lights right that didn't

1500
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:39,529
than those two lights right that didn't
 

1501
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,409
than those two lights right that didn't
make any sense to me so then I but then

1502
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:41,419
make any sense to me so then I but then
 

1503
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,989
make any sense to me so then I but then
I started doing research and again I

1504
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:42,999
I started doing research and again I
 

1505
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,579
I started doing research and again I
start looking at how what can I do

1506
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:45,589
start looking at how what can I do
 

1507
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,739
start looking at how what can I do
that's kind of like tinker and and have

1508
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:47,749
that's kind of like tinker and and have
 

1509
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:49,450
that's kind of like tinker and and have
fun and I started looking at the other

1510
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:49,460
fun and I started looking at the other
 

1511
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,700
fun and I started looking at the other
lights that I have and well they are not

1512
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:51,710
lights that I have and well they are not
 

1513
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,019
lights that I have and well they are not
DMX compatible Oh however you can buy a

1514
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:56,029
DMX compatible Oh however you can buy a
 

1515
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:58,329
DMX compatible Oh however you can buy a
little controller that takes the power

1516
00:32:58,329 --> 00:32:58,339
little controller that takes the power
 

1517
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:01,060
little controller that takes the power
and then takes DMX input and then

1518
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,070
and then takes DMX input and then
 

1519
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,389
and then takes DMX input and then
connects to any of the standard LEDs or

1520
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
connects to any of the standard LEDs or
 

1521
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,789
connects to any of the standard LEDs or
if you want to do like light tracks with

1522
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
if you want to do like light tracks with
 

1523
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,570
if you want to do like light tracks with
the you know the spool of light cable le

1524
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:10,580
the you know the spool of light cable le
 

1525
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,609
the you know the spool of light cable le
pieu so for me that's all possible but

1526
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:15,619
pieu so for me that's all possible but
 

1527
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,310
pieu so for me that's all possible but
then so again I'm looking at okay well

1528
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,320
then so again I'm looking at okay well
 

1529
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,099
then so again I'm looking at okay well
you know how can i what else can I do

1530
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:21,109
you know how can i what else can I do
 

1531
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:23,219
you know how can i what else can I do
with this is it worth getting mm-hmm

1532
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:23,229
with this is it worth getting mm-hmm
 

1533
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:27,219
with this is it worth getting mm-hmm
there are DMX lights that you've

1534
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:27,229
there are DMX lights that you've
 

1535
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:28,839
there are DMX lights that you've
probably seen them that have a pan and

1536
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:28,849
probably seen them that have a pan and
 

1537
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,789
probably seen them that have a pan and
tilt feature yes so you've probably seen

1538
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:30,799
tilt feature yes so you've probably seen
 

1539
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,560
tilt feature yes so you've probably seen
them at dances and everything else and

1540
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:32,570
them at dances and everything else and
 

1541
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,440
them at dances and everything else and
with these lights you can move the light

1542
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,450
with these lights you can move the light
 

1543
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,299
with these lights you can move the light
around using that controller okay then I

1544
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:40,309
around using that controller okay then I
 

1545
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,489
around using that controller okay then I
got looking at a particular very very

1546
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:42,499
got looking at a particular very very
 

1547
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:46,029
got looking at a particular very very
cheap one and realize that there are

1548
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:46,039
cheap one and realize that there are
 

1549
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:52,239
cheap one and realize that there are
screws to remove the faceplate Y for

1550
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:52,249
screws to remove the faceplate Y for
 

1551
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,220
screws to remove the faceplate Y for
service presumably okay

1552
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,230
service presumably okay
 

1553
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,770
service presumably okay
remember when I said look look thinking

1554
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:56,780
remember when I said look look thinking
 

1555
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,750
remember when I said look look thinking
about ways that I could use a 3d printer

1556
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:58,760
about ways that I could use a 3d printer
 

1557
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,150
about ways that I could use a 3d printer
to do cool things that would save money

1558
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,160
to do cool things that would save money
 

1559
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,640
to do cool things that would save money
are you gonna make a basketball no telly

1560
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:03,650
are you gonna make a basketball no telly
 

1561
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,740
are you gonna make a basketball no telly
think about a pan tilt zoom camera for

1562
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:05,750
think about a pan tilt zoom camera for
 

1563
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,880
think about a pan tilt zoom camera for
$2,000 yeah okay then think about a pan

1564
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:09,890
$2,000 yeah okay then think about a pan
 

1565
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:13,870
$2,000 yeah okay then think about a pan
and tilt light that's controlled by this

1566
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:13,880
and tilt light that's controlled by this
 

1567
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,800
and tilt light that's controlled by this
controller for only $90 okay take the

1568
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:17,810
controller for only $90 okay take the
 

1569
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,890
controller for only $90 okay take the
faceplate off put a Raspberry Pi inside

1570
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:20,900
faceplate off put a Raspberry Pi inside
 

1571
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,670
faceplate off put a Raspberry Pi inside
of it with the Raspberry Pi HQ camera 3d

1572
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:24,680
of it with the Raspberry Pi HQ camera 3d
 

1573
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,980
of it with the Raspberry Pi HQ camera 3d
print a new faceplate to hold that in

1574
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:26,990
print a new faceplate to hold that in
 

1575
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,390
print a new faceplate to hold that in
place now you've got a DMX controlled

1576
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:30,400
place now you've got a DMX controlled
 

1577
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,050
place now you've got a DMX controlled
Raspberry Pi HQ camera which we we would

1578
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:35,060
Raspberry Pi HQ camera which we we would
 

1579
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,090
Raspberry Pi HQ camera which we we would
be able to hang on the ceiling we'd be

1580
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,100
be able to hang on the ceiling we'd be
 

1581
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,120
be able to hang on the ceiling we'd be
able to control for doing product

1582
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,130
able to control for doing product
 

1583
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,040
able to control for doing product
reviews and overhead shots which we

1584
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,050
reviews and overhead shots which we
 

1585
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,900
reviews and overhead shots which we
can't currently do right because we

1586
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:43,910
can't currently do right because we
 

1587
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,640
can't currently do right because we
don't have that capability and a PTZ

1588
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:45,650
don't have that capability and a PTZ
 

1589
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,300
don't have that capability and a PTZ
cameras 2,000 bucks I like that still

1590
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,310
cameras 2,000 bucks I like that still
 

1591
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,110
cameras 2,000 bucks I like that still
think you should print a bad symbol for

1592
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,120
think you should print a bad symbol for
 

1593
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,280
think you should print a bad symbol for
there's nothing stopping us from doing

1594
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,290
there's nothing stopping us from doing
 

1595
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,520
there's nothing stopping us from doing
that Jeff go yeah so with with that

1596
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:57,530
that Jeff go yeah so with with that
 

1597
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,470
that Jeff go yeah so with with that
controller you can control as many like

1598
00:34:59,470 --> 00:34:59,480
controller you can control as many like
 

1599
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,410
controller you can control as many like
it'll do it has 196 channels so you can

1600
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:02,420
it'll do it has 196 channels so you can
 

1601
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,440
it'll do it has 196 channels so you can
control as many lights and and pan-tilt

1602
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,450
control as many lights and and pan-tilt
 

1603
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,590
control as many lights and and pan-tilt
systems as you want from that controller

1604
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:07,600
systems as you want from that controller
 

1605
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,230
systems as you want from that controller
basically virtually no limit for a small

1606
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,240
basically virtually no limit for a small
 

1607
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,370
basically virtually no limit for a small
studio like ours

1608
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:12,380
studio like ours
 

1609
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,070
studio like ours
I wonder if and I'm just thinking from a

1610
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,080
I wonder if and I'm just thinking from a
 

1611
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,700
I wonder if and I'm just thinking from a
pure like security standpoint and if you

1612
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:18,710
pure like security standpoint and if you
 

1613
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,490
pure like security standpoint and if you
could use that housing to also hold like

1614
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:21,500
could use that housing to also hold like
 

1615
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,090
could use that housing to also hold like
a wise cam so that you've got your

1616
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:25,100
a wise cam so that you've got your
 

1617
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,520
a wise cam so that you've got your
cameras inside yeah the lights have

1618
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:27,530
cameras inside yeah the lights have
 

1619
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,590
cameras inside yeah the lights have
multiple cameras yeah so there's no

1620
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:29,600
multiple cameras yeah so there's no
 

1621
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,780
multiple cameras yeah so there's no
reason why not that way you can have

1622
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:31,790
reason why not that way you can have
 

1623
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,870
reason why not that way you can have
your PTZ security as well going on yeah

1624
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
your PTZ security as well going on yeah
 

1625
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,600
your PTZ security as well going on yeah
sure move it around

1626
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:37,610
sure move it around
 

1627
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,490
sure move it around
well or you could just buy a PTZ wise

1628
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:39,500
well or you could just buy a PTZ wise
 

1629
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,000
well or you could just buy a PTZ wise
cam but in particular you could use with

1630
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,010
cam but in particular you could use with
 

1631
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,120
cam but in particular you could use with
really sure in particular the HQ cam for

1632
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,130
really sure in particular the HQ cam for
 

1633
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,460
really sure in particular the HQ cam for
the Raspberry Pi is like a full quality

1634
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:48,470
the Raspberry Pi is like a full quality
 

1635
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,800
the Raspberry Pi is like a full quality
camera yeah so I can install software on

1636
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:50,810
camera yeah so I can install software on
 

1637
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,860
camera yeah so I can install software on
there to turn it into an HD camera for

1638
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:53,870
there to turn it into an HD camera for
 

1639
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,430
there to turn it into an HD camera for
our show very cool that's something that

1640
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
our show very cool that's something that
 

1641
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,180
our show very cool that's something that
has me kind of excited hmm hmm it's just

1642
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,190
has me kind of excited hmm hmm it's just
 

1643
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,610
has me kind of excited hmm hmm it's just
a thought it's just an idea I again I

1644
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:03,620
a thought it's just an idea I again I
 

1645
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,800
a thought it's just an idea I again I
don't own a 3d printer so I can't but I

1646
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:05,810
don't own a 3d printer so I can't but I
 

1647
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,599
don't own a 3d printer so I can't but I
can start designing

1648
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:07,609
can start designing
 

1649
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:10,449
can start designing
the idea crafting the idea and maybe

1650
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:10,459
the idea crafting the idea and maybe
 

1651
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,729
the idea crafting the idea and maybe
have somebody else print that design for

1652
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:12,739
have somebody else print that design for
 

1653
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:16,839
have somebody else print that design for
me if it works just an idea what do you

1654
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:16,849
me if it works just an idea what do you
 

1655
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,729
me if it works just an idea what do you
guys think is that something that sounds

1656
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:18,739
guys think is that something that sounds
 

1657
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:19,059
guys think is that something that sounds
fun

1658
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:19,069
fun
 

1659
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:23,140
fun
I hey yep and then all of our lights in

1660
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,150
I hey yep and then all of our lights in
 

1661
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,459
I hey yep and then all of our lights in
here in the studio here going to be

1662
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:24,469
here in the studio here going to be
 

1663
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:28,509
here in the studio here going to be
controlled by the the DMX did I say DMZ

1664
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:28,519
controlled by the the DMX did I say DMZ
 

1665
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,089
controlled by the the DMX did I say DMZ
I might have said DMZ no I did I say DMX

1666
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:31,099
I might have said DMZ no I did I say DMX
 

1667
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:36,160
I might have said DMZ no I did I say DMX
okay there's so many acronyms very cool

1668
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,170
okay there's so many acronyms very cool
 

1669
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,049
okay there's so many acronyms very cool
well this has been fun this is really

angle and that's why I also took them
 

2273
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,060
angle and that's why I also took them
much longer to go live rather than like

like here peanut Corporation of America
that company doesn't exist anymore

2310
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,020
that company doesn't exist anymore
 

2311
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,900
that company doesn't exist anymore
because of the salmonella outbreak and

2312
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:08,910
because of the salmonella outbreak and
 

2313
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,010
because of the salmonella outbreak and
the executives were handed 28 years of

2314
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,020
the executives were handed 28 years of
 

2315
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,320
the executives were handed 28 years of
prison and so it's important to really

2316
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:15,330
prison and so it's important to really
 

2317
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,430
prison and so it's important to really
have an end-to-end tool that you can

2318
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:19,440
have an end-to-end tool that you can
 

2319
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,620
have an end-to-end tool that you can
rely on and that's what they developed

2320
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:21,630
rely on and that's what they developed
 

2321
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,410
rely on and that's what they developed
on the Cardinal block chain now and I

2322
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:24,420
on the Cardinal block chain now and I
 

2323
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,060
on the Cardinal block chain now and I
hope they one day they will also do that

2324
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,070
hope they one day they will also do that
 

2325
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,980
hope they one day they will also do that
on the medical side because I heard that

2326
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:29,990
on the medical side because I heard that
 

2327
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,450
on the medical side because I heard that
percent of all medication that you can

2328
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:32,460
percent of all medication that you can
 

2329
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,500
percent of all medication that you can
buy is fake or substandard and so such a

2330
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:36,510
buy is fake or substandard and so such a
 

2331
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,240
buy is fake or substandard and so such a
tool would be fantastic also in the

2332
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,250
tool would be fantastic also in the
 

2333
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,910
tool would be fantastic also in the
medical sector

2334
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:39,920
medical sector
 

2335
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,410
medical sector
next is onboarding so I mean in the

2336
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:45,420
next is onboarding so I mean in the
 

2337
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,720
next is onboarding so I mean in the
Western world we don't have huge

2338
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:46,730
Western world we don't have huge
 

2339
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,280
Western world we don't have huge
problems in getting access to banks or

2340
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:49,290
problems in getting access to banks or
 

2341
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,410
problems in getting access to banks or
loans in other countries like here this

2342
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:51,420
loans in other countries like here this
 

2343
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,820
loans in other countries like here this
is Africa for example it looks

2344
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:52,830
is Africa for example it looks
 

2345
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,010
is Africa for example it looks
completely different but how do you do

2346
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,020
completely different but how do you do
 

2347
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,780
completely different but how do you do
that you need to make it in a way that

2348
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:56,790
that you need to make it in a way that
 

2349
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,600
that you need to make it in a way that
it is secure and that's exactly what

2350
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,610
it is secure and that's exactly what
 

2351
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,040
it is secure and that's exactly what
they developed here with a project

2352
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,050
they developed here with a project
 

2353
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,190
they developed here with a project
called Attalla prism and it's a big deal

2354
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:04,200
called Attalla prism and it's a big deal
 

2355
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,920
called Attalla prism and it's a big deal
because it simply will open up

2356
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:05,930
because it simply will open up
 

2357
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,750
because it simply will open up
opportunities like lending payments

2358
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:08,760
opportunities like lending payments
 

2359
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,240
opportunities like lending payments
insurance banking so in total they

2360
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:11,250
insurance banking so in total they
 

2361
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:15,020
insurance banking so in total they
calculate over 400 billion globally in

2362
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,030
calculate over 400 billion globally in
 

2363
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,360
calculate over 400 billion globally in
defy payments and in Africa that could

2364
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:17,370
defy payments and in Africa that could
 

2365
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:19,460
defy payments and in Africa that could
benefit from such a tool it's just to

2366
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:19,470
benefit from such a tool it's just to
 

2367
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:22,790
benefit from such a tool it's just to
make sure that you're in a secure way

2368
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
make sure that you're in a secure way
 

2369
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,720
make sure that you're in a secure way
are able to access these finance tools

2370
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:26,730
are able to access these finance tools
 

2371
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:31,450
are able to access these finance tools
in this case yeah so it's a fantastic

2372
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:31,460
in this case yeah so it's a fantastic
 

2373
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,730
in this case yeah so it's a fantastic
product for the unbanked

2374
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:34,740
product for the unbanked
 

2375
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:38,540
product for the unbanked
next one is Cardno aims to be extremely

2376
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:38,550
next one is Cardno aims to be extremely
 

2377
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,190
next one is Cardno aims to be extremely
decentralized at the moment it's a

2378
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:40,200
decentralized at the moment it's a
 

2379
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,770
decentralized at the moment it's a
little bit decentralized but if you want

2380
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:42,780
little bit decentralized but if you want
 

2381
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,310
little bit decentralized but if you want
to have something very decentralized

2382
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:45,320
to have something very decentralized
 

2383
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,350
to have something very decentralized
then you need to offer also tools in

2384
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:48,360
then you need to offer also tools in
 

2385
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,300
then you need to offer also tools in
regards to the governance and they

2386
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:50,310
regards to the governance and they
 

2387
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,820
regards to the governance and they
develop this year with on the Cardno

2388
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:54,830
develop this year with on the Cardno
 

2389
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,870
develop this year with on the Cardno
platform and how the government's look

2390
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:56,880
platform and how the government's look
 

2391
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,140
platform and how the government's look
like it looks like it's fantastic and

2392
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:00,150
like it looks like it's fantastic and
 

2393
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,730
like it looks like it's fantastic and
it's well thought through so it's worth

2394
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:01,740
it's well thought through so it's worth
 

2395
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,190
it's well thought through so it's worth
taking a look at there so how is the

2396
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:04,200
taking a look at there so how is the
 

2397
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,870
taking a look at there so how is the
voting done what can you do with your

2398
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:05,880
voting done what can you do with your
 

2399
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,330
voting done what can you do with your
coins and so on then part of the

2400
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:08,340
coins and so on then part of the
 

2401
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,380
coins and so on then part of the
decentralization you will be also a fund

2402
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:12,390
decentralization you will be also a fund
 

2403
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,690
decentralization you will be also a fund
and this she'd remember probably I fund

2404
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:14,700
and this she'd remember probably I fund
 

2405
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,810
and this she'd remember probably I fund

in it already to fund developers coming

2414
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:32,460
in it already to fund developers coming
 

2415
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,400
in it already to fund developers coming
up with new ideas and will be then the

2416
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,410
up with new ideas and will be then the
 

2417
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:38,030
up with new ideas and will be then the
chain governance decides whether those

2418
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:38,040
chain governance decides whether those
 

2419
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,850
chain governance decides whether those
developers will get those grants or not

2420
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:40,860
developers will get those grants or not
 

2421
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,860
developers will get those grants or not
and they oh there will also be linked to

2422
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:42,870
and they oh there will also be linked to
 

2423

deliverables which I find fairly
 

2425
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,410
deliverables which I find fairly
attractive so that's a new way of

a project and the last one that I saw is
 

2431
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:56,330
a project and the last one that I saw is
also that coinbase custody which is just

2432
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:56,340
also that coinbase custody which is just
 

2433
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,350
also that coinbase custody which is just
the department of coinbase will support

2434
00:52:59,350 --> 00:52:59,360
the department of coinbase will support
 

2435
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,010
the department of coinbase will support

some really interesting developments on
 

2441
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,450
some really interesting developments on
the Cardinal platform which I found

2442
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:11,460
the Cardinal platform which I found
 

2443
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,760
the Cardinal platform which I found
interesting because it will shape the

2444

the family so that's the only bit that I
 

2693
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:08,960
the family so that's the only bit that I
have with it

2694
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:08,970
have with it
 

2695
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,839
have with it
it's it's a nice feature that that

2696
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:11,849
it's it's a nice feature that that
 

2697
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:14,960
it's it's a nice feature that that
they're rolling it with because that's

2698
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:14,970
they're rolling it with because that's
 

2699
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,609
they're rolling it with because that's
been one of the challenges we've had

2700
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:16,619
been one of the challenges we've had
 

2701
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,220
been one of the challenges we've had
like we have we have an Android box at

2702
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:19,230
like we have we have an Android box at
 

2703
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,290
like we have we have an Android box at
home for the purpose of being able to

2704
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:21,300
home for the purpose of being able to
 

2705
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,820
home for the purpose of being able to
get Disney Plus and Amazon Prime TV on

2706
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:25,830
get Disney Plus and Amazon Prime TV on
 

2707
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,070
get Disney Plus and Amazon Prime TV on
our home TV because it's not a Smart TV

2708
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:28,080
our home TV because it's not a Smart TV
 

2709
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,940
our home TV because it's not a Smart TV
or anything like that

2710
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:28,950
or anything like that
 

2711
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,920
or anything like that
so we needed a way to put all those kind

2712
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:30,930
so we needed a way to put all those kind
 

2713
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:34,430
so we needed a way to put all those kind
of in there and and and one of the

2714
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:34,440
of in there and and and one of the
 

2715
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,980
of in there and and and one of the
things that I've struggled with is

2716
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:35,990
things that I've struggled with is
 

2717
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:40,010
things that I've struggled with is
whenever we've gone to Amazon to watch

2718
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,020
whenever we've gone to Amazon to watch
 

2719
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,810
whenever we've gone to Amazon to watch
their content there is no way to

2720
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:41,820
their content there is no way to
 

2721
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,180
their content there is no way to
separate between the kids and the and

2722
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:44,190
separate between the kids and the and
 

2723
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,250
separate between the kids and the and
the adults and so this is a nice feature

2724
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:46,260
the adults and so this is a nice feature
 

2725
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,170
the adults and so this is a nice feature
they're rolling out but up until this

2726
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:48,180
they're rolling out but up until this
 

2727
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,990
they're rolling out but up until this
point I've not allowed our kids to go on

2728
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:51,000
point I've not allowed our kids to go on
 

2729
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,720
point I've not allowed our kids to go on
to the Amazon content because I don't

2730
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:53,730
to the Amazon content because I don't
 

2731
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,400
to the Amazon content because I don't
want them just opening up something and

2732
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,410
want them just opening up something and
 

2733
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:58,790
want them just opening up something and
be like oh that's that's different

2734
00:58:58,790 --> 00:58:58,800
be like oh that's that's different
 

2735
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,490
be like oh that's that's different
yeah or there's the other side of it

2736
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:01,500
yeah or there's the other side of it
 

2737
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,980
yeah or there's the other side of it
where okay well each of the three kids

watching it at different places right
 

2743
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:11,420

right messes up this cue so yeah so one
 

2745
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,099
right messes up this cue so yeah so one
of the nice things about online content

2746
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:13,109
of the nice things about online content
 

2747
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:14,780
of the nice things about online content
and streaming video is that you can keep

2748
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:14,790
and streaming video is that you can keep
 

2749
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,490
and streaming video is that you can keep
track of which episode you're on well

2750
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:16,500
track of which episode you're on well
 

2751
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,440
track of which episode you're on well
