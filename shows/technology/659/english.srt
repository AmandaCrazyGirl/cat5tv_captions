00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:50,440
people are coming and going and bringing
 

317
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,850
people are coming and going and bringing
product and things like that so but one

318
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:53,860
product and things like that so but one
 

319
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,440
product and things like that so but one
of the other interesting things is the

320
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,450
of the other interesting things is the
 

321
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,120
of the other interesting things is the
the shortages that we've seen are a

322
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,130
the shortages that we've seen are a
 

323
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,230
the shortages that we've seen are a
little unexpected

324
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
little unexpected
 

325
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,110
little unexpected
so how things like here's an interesting

326
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
so how things like here's an interesting
 

327
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,650
so how things like here's an interesting
one

328
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:01,660
one
 

329
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,100
one
Plexiglas so you think about all the

330
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,110
Plexiglas so you think about all the
 

331
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,470
Plexiglas so you think about all the
stores that are putting up plexiglass

332
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:07,480
stores that are putting up plexiglass
 

333
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,770
stores that are putting up plexiglass
dividers which absolutely makes sense as

334
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:10,780
dividers which absolutely makes sense as
 

335
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,090
dividers which absolutely makes sense as
a safety precaution and and maybe not so

336
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,100
a safety precaution and and maybe not so
 

337
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,410
a safety precaution and and maybe not so
much even for the customers but

338
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:16,420
much even for the customers but
 

339
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,900
much even for the customers but
definitely for the staff I mean my

340
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:18,910
definitely for the staff I mean my
 

341
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,320
definitely for the staff I mean my
stepmother works at a liquor store okay

342
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,330
stepmother works at a liquor store okay
 

343
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,320
stepmother works at a liquor store okay
and so she's interacting with hundreds

344
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,330
and so she's interacting with hundreds
 

345
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,870
and so she's interacting with hundreds
of people per day they line up you know

346
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
of people per day they line up you know
 

347
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,600
of people per day they line up you know
each other they do and and so to protect

348
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:33,610
each other they do and and so to protect
 

349
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,470
each other they do and and so to protect
her who I would say is you know at her

350
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:37,480
her who I would say is you know at her
 

351
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,660
her who I would say is you know at her
age would be a vulnerable person and and

352
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:39,670
age would be a vulnerable person and and
 

353
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,580
age would be a vulnerable person and and
so I like that there's Plexiglas

354
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:41,590
so I like that there's Plexiglas
 

355
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,140
so I like that there's Plexiglas
dividing her from those hundreds of

356
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,150
dividing her from those hundreds of
 

357
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,630
dividing her from those hundreds of
people plain and simple and whether or

358
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:45,640
people plain and simple and whether or
 

359
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,450
people plain and simple and whether or
not it's a risk here in Canada like

360
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:48,460
not it's a risk here in Canada like
 

361
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,520
not it's a risk here in Canada like
that's neither here nor there it's like

362
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:50,530
that's neither here nor there it's like
 

363
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,290
that's neither here nor there it's like
there are certain things that need to be

364
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,300
there are certain things that need to be
 

365
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,470
there are certain things that need to be
in place just to play it safe I'm more

366
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:55,480
in place just to play it safe I'm more
 

367
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,690
in place just to play it safe I'm more
of the mindset to just play it safe even

368
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:57,700
of the mindset to just play it safe even
 

369
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,870
of the mindset to just play it safe even
though maybe I'm not vulnerable or maybe

370
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:00,880
though maybe I'm not vulnerable or maybe
 

371
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,820
though maybe I'm not vulnerable or maybe
you know like that's that's neither here

372
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:02,830
you know like that's that's neither here
 

373
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,240
you know like that's that's neither here
nor there to me I'd rather just hey

374
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,250
nor there to me I'd rather just hey
 

375
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,920
nor there to me I'd rather just hey
let's err on the side of caution yeah

376
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:07,930
let's err on the side of caution yeah
 

377
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,920
let's err on the side of caution yeah
that's my thing

378
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:09,930
that's my thing
 

379
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,390
that's my thing
but with the shortage of Plexiglas

380
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
but with the shortage of Plexiglas
 

381
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,110
but with the shortage of Plexiglas
because of this raspberry pie cases

382
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,120
because of this raspberry pie cases
 

383
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,070
because of this raspberry pie cases
become short supply because there's not

384
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
become short supply because there's not
 

385
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,130
become short supply because there's not
enough Plexiglas for the manufacturers

386
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,140
enough Plexiglas for the manufacturers
 

387
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,100
enough Plexiglas for the manufacturers
to create these plexi cases well now

388
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,110
to create these plexi cases well now
 

389
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,120
to create these plexi cases well now
that we've got a surplus of toilet paper

390
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,130
that we've got a surplus of toilet paper
 

391
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,290
that we've got a surplus of toilet paper
some households do but I mean you know

392
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:34,300
some households do but I mean you know
 

393
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,420
some households do but I mean you know
you talk about Plexiglas but as it

394
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:36,430
you talk about Plexiglas but as it
 

395
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,860
you talk about Plexiglas but as it
relates to raspberry pie but it is

396
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:37,870
relates to raspberry pie but it is
 

397
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,990
relates to raspberry pie but it is
interesting one of the things that I

398
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
interesting one of the things that I
 

399
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,080
interesting one of the things that I
have noticed since you know you lack the

400
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,090
have noticed since you know you lack the
 

401
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,080

general but for me I can't get into a
 

405
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,130
general but for me I can't get into a

big box stores
far as for tech where you walk in you go

412
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
far as for tech where you walk in you go
 

413
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,439
far as for tech where you walk in you go
buy a computer off the shelf but if you

because they don't want people browsing
 

423
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,769
because they don't want people browsing
into the shelves and touching so you

424
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:10,779
into the shelves and touching so you
 

425
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,540
into the shelves and touching so you
have to go to the door and purchase and

426
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:12,550
have to go to the door and purchase and
 

427

have to go to the door and purchase and
and it for me or is the same well yeah

428
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:14,980
and it for me or is the same well yeah
 

429
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,490
and it for me or is the same well yeah
but I need to build a computer right now

430
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,500
but I need to build a computer right now
 

431
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,970
but I need to build a computer right now
and with on its where it's at look like

432
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:20,980
and with on its where it's at look like
 

433
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,220
and with on its where it's at look like
Newegg is where it's at well that's the

434
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,230
Newegg is where it's at well that's the
 

435
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,769
Newegg is where it's at well that's the
thing so I can get some of the parts but

436
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:25,779
thing so I can get some of the parts but
 

437
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,269
thing so I can get some of the parts but
not all of them because there's the

438
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
not all of them because there's the
 

439
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,860
not all of them because there's the
shipping delays going across borders and

440
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,870
shipping delays going across borders and
 

441
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,829
shipping delays going across borders and
stuff but it's the people interaction

442
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
stuff but it's the people interaction
 

443
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,769
stuff but it's the people interaction
that I'm realizing I think I know what I

444
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:34,779
that I'm realizing I think I know what I
 

445
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,360
that I'm realizing I think I know what I
want for building a computer but I want

446
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,370
want for building a computer but I want
 

447
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,500
want for building a computer but I want
to walk in and go these are the

448
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,510
to walk in and go these are the
 

449
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,660
to walk in and go these are the
components I'm thinking of is this the

450
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:39,670
components I'm thinking of is this the
 

451
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,189
components I'm thinking of is this the
way to go about it or do I need

452
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:41,199
way to go about it or do I need
 

453
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,139
way to go about it or do I need
something else and have somebody go oh

454
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:43,149
something else and have somebody go oh
 

455
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,240
something else and have somebody go oh
hold on that's not you got to be aware

456
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,250
hold on that's not you got to be aware
 

457
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,699
hold on that's not you got to be aware
of this yeah and then this and I go oh

458
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:47,709
of this yeah and then this and I go oh
 

459
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:48,449
of this yeah and then this and I go oh
that makes sense

460
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:48,459
that makes sense
 

461
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,990
that makes sense
I can't do that now so now I'm gunshot

462
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't do that now so now I'm gunshot
 

463
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,819
I can't do that now so now I'm gunshot
you know to write those kinds of threads

464
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:53,829
you know to write those kinds of threads
 

465
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,800
you know to write those kinds of threads
in all right is there a difficult yeah

466
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:55,810
in all right is there a difficult yeah
 

467
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,420
in all right is there a difficult yeah
cuz it's like if I buy this and I buy

468
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,430
cuz it's like if I buy this and I buy
 

469
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,710
cuz it's like if I buy this and I buy
this and I buy this is it gonna work

470
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
this and I buy this is it gonna work

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,330
thank you for talking about this yeah I
worked on it some more and I do have an

1240
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:17,340
worked on it some more and I do have an
 

1241
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,550
worked on it some more and I do have an
update based on our conversation oh can

1242
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:19,560
update based on our conversation oh can
 

1243
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,930
update based on our conversation oh can
you tell us a little bit about that yeah

1244
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:20,940
you tell us a little bit about that yeah
 

1245
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,670
you tell us a little bit about that yeah
I I've already kind of announced who

1246
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:22,680
I I've already kind of announced who
 

1247
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,510
I I've already kind of announced who
gets the cupcake but yeah so I did get

1248
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:26,520
gets the cupcake but yeah so I did get
 

1249
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,210
gets the cupcake but yeah so I did get
the server up and running and for a

1250
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,220
the server up and running and for a
 

1251
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,890
the server up and running and for a
single user to log in it was not bad

1252
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:32,900
single user to log in it was not bad
 

1253
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,900
single user to log in it was not bad
okay as soon as my kids joined not so

1254
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:35,910
okay as soon as my kids joined not so
 

1255
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,080
okay as soon as my kids joined not so
good oh yeah I we had 3 computers so I

1256
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,090
good oh yeah I we had 3 computers so I
 

1257
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,200
good oh yeah I we had 3 computers so I
got the the logins activated and it just

1258
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,210
got the the logins activated and it just
 

1259
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,670
got the the logins activated and it just
hmm so I would not use the 3 B+ okay

1260
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:46,680
hmm so I would not use the 3 B+ okay
 

1261
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,840
hmm so I would not use the 3 B+ okay
here's now I've got it on a no droid I'm

1262
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:50,850
here's now I've got it on a no droid I'm
 

1263
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,540
here's now I've got it on a no droid I'm
going the next step up Oh droid x u 4x u

1264
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:53,550
going the next step up Oh droid x u 4x u
 

1265
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,970
going the next step up Oh droid x u 4x u
4 with 2 gigs of ram with 2 with the MMC

1266
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:55,980
4 with 2 gigs of ram with 2 with the MMC
 

1267
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,160
4 with 2 gigs of ram with 2 with the MMC
er using SD I'm using emmc

1268
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,170
er using SD I'm using emmc
 

1269
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,870
er using SD I'm using emmc
I've got a 64 gig emmc on there you know

1270
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
I've got a 64 gig emmc on there you know
 

1271
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,310
I've got a 64 gig emmc on there you know
which is way more than I need for the

1272
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
which is way more than I need for the
 

1273
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,680
which is way more than I need for the
server you say that but then your kids

1274
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:06,690
server you say that but then your kids
 

1275
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,990
server you say that but then your kids
become master builder well exactly and

1276
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,000
become master builder well exactly and
 

1277
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,520
become master builder well exactly and
that's why I went with a bigger one I

1278
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:10,530
that's why I went with a bigger one I
 

1279
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,080
that's why I went with a bigger one I
debated on the 128 but I'm like I think

1280
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,090
debated on the 128 but I'm like I think
 

1281
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,160
debated on the 128 but I'm like I think
that's a bit overkill right now for

1282
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,170
that's a bit overkill right now for
 

1283
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,560
that's a bit overkill right now for
minecraft server but I so the Raspberry

1284
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,570
minecraft server but I so the Raspberry
 

1285
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,030
minecraft server but I so the Raspberry
Pi 3 B+ was too slow going beyond

1286
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,040
Pi 3 B+ was too slow going beyond
 

1287
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,910
Pi 3 B+ was too slow going beyond
multiple a single user and I think even

1288
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:22,920
multiple a single user and I think even
 

1289
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,660
multiple a single user and I think even
if it was speedy enough to run multiple

1290
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:26,670
if it was speedy enough to run multiple
 

1291
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,940
if it was speedy enough to run multiple
users by the time they start creating

1292
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:28,950
users by the time they start creating
 

1293
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,800
users by the time they start creating
and building and all that it would slow

1294
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:30,810
and building and all that it would slow
 

1295
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,240
and building and all that it would slow
right down so now I'm trying it on the

1296
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,250
right down so now I'm trying it on the
 

1297
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,920
right down so now I'm trying it on the
Xtreme I guess that world gen yeah

1298
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:33,930
Xtreme I guess that world gen yeah
 

1299
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,980
Xtreme I guess that world gen yeah
Raspberry Pi and we'll see how that goes

1300
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:36,990
Raspberry Pi and we'll see how that goes
 

1301
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,760
Raspberry Pi and we'll see how that goes
we don't have an update for us yet no oh

1302
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:39,770
we don't have an update for us yet no oh
 

1303
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,650
we don't have an update for us yet no oh
darn it Jeff

1304
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:41,660
darn it Jeff
 

1305
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,810
darn it Jeff
what is YZ like an old water so much I

1306
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:44,820
what is YZ like an old water so much I
 

1307
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,190
what is YZ like an old water so much I
got

1308
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,200
got
 

1309
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,320
got
dude so I've got to install I just

1310
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,330
dude so I've got to install I just
 

1311
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,570
dude so I've got to install I just
haven't done the the test yet you're

1312
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:50,580
haven't done the the test yet you're
 

1313
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,670
haven't done the the test yet you're
gonna fill us in on this yes of course

1314
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:52,680
gonna fill us in on this yes of course
 

1315
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,320
gonna fill us in on this yes of course
goodness and and if if the xu4 is a

1316
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,330
goodness and and if if the xu4 is a
 

1317
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,500
goodness and and if if the xu4 is a
little bit slow then I will go with the

1318
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:00,510
little bit slow then I will go with the
 

1319
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,440
little bit slow then I will go with the
Raspberry Pi okay here is what is nice

1320
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:03,450
Raspberry Pi okay here is what is nice
 

1321
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,560
Raspberry Pi okay here is what is nice
about going with the Raspberry Pi for

1322
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:05,570
about going with the Raspberry Pi for
 

1323
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,910
about going with the Raspberry Pi for
you've already created it for the

1324
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:07,920
you've already created it for the
 

1325
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,300
you've already created it for the
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ correct so all you

1326
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,310
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ correct so all you
 

1327
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,150
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ correct so all you
have to do is take the SD card out of

1328
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,160
have to do is take the SD card out of
 

1329
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,120
have to do is take the SD card out of
the three B+ pop it in a Raspberry Pi

1330
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,130
the three B+ pop it in a Raspberry Pi
 

1331
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,100
the three B+ pop it in a Raspberry Pi
four that's right and turn it on

1332
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,110
four that's right and turn it on
 

1333
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,810
four that's right and turn it on
that's right because it's already I

1334
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:20,820
that's right because it's already I
 

1335
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,090
that's right because it's already I
figured is beautiful yes that's what

1336
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,100
figured is beautiful yes that's what
 

1337
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,070
figured is beautiful yes that's what
Raspberry Pi has going for it is that it

1338
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,080
Raspberry Pi has going for it is that it
 

1339
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,440
Raspberry Pi has going for it is that it
is forward compatible it's not backward

1340
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,450
is forward compatible it's not backward
 

1341
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,650
is forward compatible it's not backward
compatible if it like you have to a well

1342
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:30,660
compatible if it like you have to a well
 

1343
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,840
compatible if it like you have to a well
not backward compatible no that's not

1344
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:32,850
not backward compatible no that's not
 

1345
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,620
not backward compatible no that's not
right

1346
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:33,630
right
 

1347
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,520
right
what I mean is that an old distro from a

1348
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:37,530
what I mean is that an old distro from a
 

1349
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,890
what I mean is that an old distro from a
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ will not work on a new

1350
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:39,900
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ will not work on a new
 

1351
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,660
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ will not work on a new
Raspberry Pi 4 because they changed the

1352
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:41,670
Raspberry Pi 4 because they changed the
 

1353
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,170
Raspberry Pi 4 because they changed the
bootloader

1354
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:42,180
bootloader
 

1355
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,770
bootloader
yes however as long as you do like an

1356
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:45,780
yes however as long as you do like an
 

1357
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,930
yes however as long as you do like an
well I presume it's a new version of

1358
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:47,940
well I presume it's a new version of
 

1359
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,080
well I presume it's a new version of
Raspberry Pi os yes yeah it was the most

1360
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,090
Raspberry Pi os yes yeah it was the most
 

1361
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,940
Raspberry Pi os yes yeah it was the most
rigid so it's gonna work on a Raspberry

1362
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:52,950
rigid so it's gonna work on a Raspberry
 

1363
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,810
rigid so it's gonna work on a Raspberry
Pi 4 or a Raspberry Pi 0 whatever but

1364
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:56,820
Pi 4 or a Raspberry Pi 0 whatever but
 

1365
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,180
Pi 4 or a Raspberry Pi 0 whatever but
the performance will be impacted if you

1366
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,190
the performance will be impacted if you
 

1367
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,220
the performance will be impacted if you
have a distro that's been built on a

1368
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,230
have a distro that's been built on a
 

1369
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,980
have a distro that's been built on a
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that's not compatible

1370
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:03,990
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that's not compatible
 

1371
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,200
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that's not compatible
with a Raspberry Pi for you can do a

1372
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,210
with a Raspberry Pi for you can do a
 

1373
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,330
with a Raspberry Pi for you can do a
disk upgrade exactly and that will

1374
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:08,340
disk upgrade exactly and that will
 

1375
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,490
disk upgrade exactly and that will
actually make it compatible with the

1376
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:10,500
actually make it compatible with the
 

1377
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,120
actually make it compatible with the
raspberry PI's all I do yeah apt update

1378
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,130
raspberry PI's all I do yeah apt update
 

1379
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,620
raspberry PI's all I do yeah apt update
and then enter and then apt upgrade and

1380
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:18,630
and then enter and then apt upgrade and
 

1381
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:23,210
and then enter and then apt upgrade and
then enter and then apt dist - upgrade

1382
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
then enter and then apt dist - upgrade
 

1383
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,920
then enter and then apt dist - upgrade
and that's all you need to do on a

1384
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:24,930
and that's all you need to do on a
 

1385
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,890
and that's all you need to do on a
Raspberry Pi 3 or 0 no and anything in

1386
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:27,900
Raspberry Pi 3 or 0 no and anything in
 

1387
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,930
Raspberry Pi 3 or 0 no and anything in
between in order to make it compatible

1388
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:29,940
between in order to make it compatible
 

1389
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,840
between in order to make it compatible
with a Raspberry Pi 4 so you can take

1390
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:32,850
with a Raspberry Pi 4 so you can take
 

1391
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,030
with a Raspberry Pi 4 so you can take
that SD card and move it into another

1392
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,040
that SD card and move it into another
 

1393
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,540
that SD card and move it into another
into a faster system you cannot take

1394
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:38,550
into a faster system you cannot take
 

1395
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,730
into a faster system you cannot take
that SD card out of the Raspberry Pi 3

1396
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:40,740
that SD card out of the Raspberry Pi 3
 

1397
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,160
that SD card out of the Raspberry Pi 3
and plug it into an X you for from ogre

1398
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,170
and plug it into an X you for from ogre
 

1399
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,740
and plug it into an X you for from ogre
ID because they are not compatible right

1400
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:45,750
ID because they are not compatible right
 

1401
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,260
ID because they are not compatible right
yeah but the Odroid has twice as much

1402
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,270
yeah but the Odroid has twice as much
 

1403
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,130
yeah but the Odroid has twice as much
RAM mm-hmm way more storage and telling

1404
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,140
RAM mm-hmm way more storage and telling
 

1405
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,740
RAM mm-hmm way more storage and telling
them see is so much faster than SD cards

1406
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:54,750
them see is so much faster than SD cards
 

1407
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,550
them see is so much faster than SD cards
especially on the pre PI 4 yeah because

1408
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:58,560
especially on the pre PI 4 yeah because
 

1409
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,630
especially on the pre PI 4 yeah because
those were

1410
00:30:59,630 --> 00:30:59,640
those were
 

1411
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,000
those were
slow SD card readers and the reason I

1412
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,010
slow SD card readers and the reason I
 

1413
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,390
slow SD card readers and the reason I
went with if I what if I had a Raspberry

1414
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:05,400
went with if I what if I had a Raspberry
 

1415
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
went with if I what if I had a Raspberry
Pi for ya one of you I would just would

1416
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,290
Pi for ya one of you I would just would
 

1417
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,260
Pi for ya one of you I would just would
have gone from the three to the four but

1418
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,270
have gone from the three to the four but
 

1419
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,540
have gone from the three to the four but
because I have not purchased a Raspberry

1420
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:11,550
because I have not purchased a Raspberry
 

1421
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,240
because I have not purchased a Raspberry
Pi four yet the xu4 is what I had and so

1422
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,250
Pi four yet the xu4 is what I had and so
 

1423
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,560
Pi four yet the xu4 is what I had and so
that's why I'm giving it a run on that

1424
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:15,570
that's why I'm giving it a run on that
 

1425
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,050
that's why I'm giving it a run on that
wonderful as I was doing it I think I've

1426
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,060
wonderful as I was doing it I think I've
 

1427
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,700
wonderful as I was doing it I think I've
thought about our conversation last week

1428
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:19,710
thought about our conversation last week
 

1429
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,230
thought about our conversation last week
you like Oh what about they dry and what

1430
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:21,240
you like Oh what about they dry and what
 

1431
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
you like Oh what about they dry and what
about the you know and so I'm like here

1432
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,250
about the you know and so I'm like here
 

1433
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,040
about the you know and so I'm like here
here's the progression on we're so we

1434
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,050
here's the progression on we're so we
 

1435
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,720
here's the progression on we're so we
can you know I'll be able to report back

1436
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:26,730
can you know I'll be able to report back
 

1437
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,240
can you know I'll be able to report back
and say this was the difference now I I

1438
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,250
and say this was the difference now I I
 

1439
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,060
and say this was the difference now I I
should have fought to do like benchmarks

1440
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,070
should have fought to do like benchmarks
 

1441
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,120
should have fought to do like benchmarks
and stuff between the two but yeah but

1442
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,130
and stuff between the two but yeah but
 

1443
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,370
and stuff between the two but yeah but
you know you can tell when you're

1444
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:37,380
you know you can tell when you're
 

1445
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,110
you know you can tell when you're
playing Minecraft if world gen is bad

1446
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
playing Minecraft if world gen is bad
 

1447
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,360
playing Minecraft if world gen is bad
yes yeah so Jeff on that now enjoy your

I'm actually gonna mosey on over to the
bridge and I want to show you my new

1456
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:54,660
bridge and I want to show you my new
 

1457
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:01,430
bridge and I want to show you my new
clock interesting see ya two seconds

1458
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,440
clock interesting see ya two seconds
 

1459
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,650
clock interesting see ya two seconds
later

1460
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:02,660
later

all right so while you enjoy that I'm
 

1469
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,660
all right so while you enjoy that I'm
just gonna work my way over to the

just gonna work my way over to the
 

1471
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,169
just gonna work my way over to the
bridge and from here what I wanted to

1472
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:24,179
bridge and from here what I wanted to
 

1473
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,169
bridge and from here what I wanted to
show you is simply a clock that I've

1474
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:27,179
show you is simply a clock that I've
 

1475
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,610
show you is simply a clock that I've
been working on I know that sounds crazy

1476
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:28,620
been working on I know that sounds crazy
 

1477
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,430
been working on I know that sounds crazy
but one of the things that I've been

1478
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
but one of the things that I've been
 

1479
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,400
but one of the things that I've been
trying to achieve with this space which

1480
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,410
trying to achieve with this space which
 

1481
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,590
trying to achieve with this space which
is our basically our producers room is

1482
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:36,600
is our basically our producers room is
 

1483
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,710
is our basically our producers room is
to make it as functional as possible but

1484
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:39,720
to make it as functional as possible but
 

1485
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
to make it as functional as possible but
also try to give it some eye candy as

1486
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:41,730
also try to give it some eye candy as
 

1487
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,600
also try to give it some eye candy as
well I've been using just a standard

1488
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:44,610
well I've been using just a standard
 

1489
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,910
well I've been using just a standard
analog clock on the wall because it has

1490
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:46,920
analog clock on the wall because it has
 

1491
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,570
analog clock on the wall because it has
tick tick tick tick and I can count the

1492
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:50,580
tick tick tick tick and I can count the
 

1493
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,160
tick tick tick tick and I can count the
seconds but I wanted to take it one more

1494
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,170
seconds but I wanted to take it one more
 

1495
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,130
seconds but I wanted to take it one more
like a step further because quite often

1496
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,140
like a step further because quite often
 

1497
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,510
like a step further because quite often
when we're producing video especially

1498
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:56,520
when we're producing video especially
 

1499
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,840
when we're producing video especially
live we have to meet markers so there's

1500
00:32:59,840 --> 00:32:59,850
live we have to meet markers so there's
 

1501
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,200
live we have to meet markers so there's
a countdown usually I have a walkie

1502
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,210
a countdown usually I have a walkie
 

1503
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,000
a countdown usually I have a walkie
talkie if I'm producing somebody in the

1504
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,010
talkie if I'm producing somebody in the
 

1505
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,430
talkie if I'm producing somebody in the
other room and I'll be communicating

1506
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
other room and I'll be communicating
 

1507
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,830
other room and I'll be communicating
back and forth in order to let them know

1508
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
back and forth in order to let them know
 

1509
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,750
back and forth in order to let them know
the countdown so you've seen it on TV

1510
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
the countdown so you've seen it on TV
 

1511
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,580
the countdown so you've seen it on TV
I'm sure so you know 5 seconds 3 mark

1512
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:16,590
I'm sure so you know 5 seconds 3 mark
 

1513
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,380
I'm sure so you know 5 seconds 3 mark
you know so we're punching in that way

1514
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,390
you know so we're punching in that way
 

1515
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,930
you know so we're punching in that way
but it's not always ideal to use just a

1516
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:20,940
but it's not always ideal to use just a
 

1517
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,690
but it's not always ideal to use just a
standard clock so I set out to build

1518
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:23,700
standard clock so I set out to build
 

1519
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,580
standard clock so I set out to build
something a little bit different and

1520
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:25,590
something a little bit different and
 

1521
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,460
something a little bit different and
it's powered by today anyways a

1522
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,470
it's powered by today anyways a
 

1523
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,590
it's powered by today anyways a
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ I am not at all

1524
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:32,600
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ I am not at all
 

1525
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,760
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ I am not at all
satisfied with the performance of that

1526
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:34,770
satisfied with the performance of that
 

1527
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,650
satisfied with the performance of that
which you're about to see

1528
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:36,660
which you're about to see
 

1529
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,410
which you're about to see
however it's given me a development

1530
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:39,420
however it's given me a development
 

1531
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,950
however it's given me a development
platform to play around with now I may

1532
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:42,960
platform to play around with now I may
 

1533
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,200
platform to play around with now I may
have to install it on something that can

1534
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,210
have to install it on something that can
 

1535
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,080
have to install it on something that can
handle better graphics well why do you

1536
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,090
handle better graphics well why do you
 

1537
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,799
handle better graphics well why do you
need graphics for a clock Robbie because

1538
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:51,809
need graphics for a clock Robbie because
 

1539
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:54,799
need graphics for a clock Robbie because
I want to so this is what I'm working on

1540
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:54,809
I want to so this is what I'm working on
 

1541
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:59,080
I want to so this is what I'm working on
I based this on the Aries jQuery

1542
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,090
I based this on the Aries jQuery
 

1543
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,299
I based this on the Aries jQuery
dashboard so you may be familiar with

1544
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:02,309
dashboard so you may be familiar with
 

1545
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,950
dashboard so you may be familiar with
that but what I've done is I've actually

1546
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:03,960
that but what I've done is I've actually
 

1547
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,180
that but what I've done is I've actually
created a functional clock out of this

1548
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,190
created a functional clock out of this
 

1549
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,639
created a functional clock out of this
system so so I've taken that it's

1550
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:10,649
system so so I've taken that it's
 

1551
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,010
system so so I've taken that it's
basically a template and then I've

1552
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,020
basically a template and then I've
 

1553
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,980
basically a template and then I've
created a jQuery clock counter countdown

1554
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:17,990
created a jQuery clock counter countdown
 

1555
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,470
created a jQuery clock counter countdown
disk check that uses Ajax to PHP to be

1556
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:21,480
disk check that uses Ajax to PHP to be
 

1557
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,000
disk check that uses Ajax to PHP to be
able to check my network to see if

1558
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,010
able to check my network to see if
 

1559
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,050
able to check my network to see if
there's any hard drive failures or

1560
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,060
there's any hard drive failures or
 

1561
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,750
there's any hard drive failures or
or hard drives that are full in our

1562
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:27,760
or hard drives that are full in our
 

1563
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,990
or hard drives that are full in our
array and I'll show you also it even

1564
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:31,000
array and I'll show you also it even
 

1565
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,730
array and I'll show you also it even
shows when we're live on the air so

1566
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:32,740
shows when we're live on the air so
 

1567
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,020
shows when we're live on the air so
that's pretty cool right now it's not

1568
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,030
that's pretty cool right now it's not
 

1569
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,440
that's pretty cool right now it's not
connected so we've got Studio II up here

1570
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,450
connected so we've got Studio II up here
 

1571
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,700
connected so we've got Studio II up here
these are the only things that are not

1572
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:38,710
these are the only things that are not
 

1573
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,020
these are the only things that are not
functional these are just eye candy

1574
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,030
functional these are just eye candy
 

1575
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,170
functional these are just eye candy
right now from the original theme I've

1576
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:43,180
right now from the original theme I've
 

1577
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,210
right now from the original theme I've
left them in just to make it so that

1578
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:45,220
left them in just to make it so that
 

1579
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,700
left them in just to make it so that
there's some filled space there no point

1580
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:47,710
there's some filled space there no point
 

1581
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,380
there's some filled space there no point
in removing them and having having it

1582
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:49,390
in removing them and having having it
 

1583
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,790
in removing them and having having it
not look symmetrical so so with this we

1584
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:53,800
not look symmetrical so so with this we
 

1585
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,280
not look symmetrical so so with this we
can ignore those things here we have the

1586
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,290
can ignore those things here we have the
 

1587
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,020
can ignore those things here we have the
actual functional clock and I've got

1588
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,030
actual functional clock and I've got
 

1589
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,990
actual functional clock and I've got
Greek for time there according to Google

1590
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,000
Greek for time there according to Google
 

1591
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,830
Greek for time there according to Google
Translate so we've got 946 is the time

1592
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:04,840
Translate so we've got 946 is the time
 

1593
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,640
Translate so we've got 946 is the time
and we've got a seconds counter here ten

1594
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:07,650
and we've got a seconds counter here ten
 

1595
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,950
and we've got a seconds counter here ten
eleven twelve so you can see how janky

1596
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:10,960
eleven twelve so you can see how janky
 

1597
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,540
eleven twelve so you can see how janky
the video is that's because of the

1598
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:12,550
the video is that's because of the
 

1599
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,720
the video is that's because of the
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ not being it's the

1600
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:15,730
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ not being it's the
 

1601
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,850
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ not being it's the
graphics processing not being able to

1602
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:17,860
graphics processing not being able to
 

1603
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,740
graphics processing not being able to
keep up with the with the visual effects

1604
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,750
keep up with the with the visual effects
 

1605
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,640
keep up with the with the visual effects
that I've created

1606
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:20,650
that I've created
 

1607
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,680
that I've created
it runs stellar on my Linux desktop so

1608
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:25,690
it runs stellar on my Linux desktop so
 

1609
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,780
it runs stellar on my Linux desktop so
that's the actual time nothing fancy

1610
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:27,790
that's the actual time nothing fancy
 

1611
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,850
that's the actual time nothing fancy
there except I wanted to separate out

1612
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:29,860
there except I wanted to separate out
 

1613
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,670
there except I wanted to separate out
the seconds rather than having them in

1614
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:32,680
the seconds rather than having them in
 

1615
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,280
the seconds rather than having them in
line like you'd normally see like 9 : 46

1616
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,290
line like you'd normally see like 9 : 46
 

1617
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,400
line like you'd normally see like 9 : 46
: 38 I wanted to move that 38 up here

1618
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,410
: 38 I wanted to move that 38 up here
 

1619
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,930
: 38 I wanted to move that 38 up here
and it's counting in real-time using

1620
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,940
and it's counting in real-time using
 

1621
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,270
and it's counting in real-time using
jQuery so every second there's a timer

1622
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:42,280
jQuery so every second there's a timer
 

1623
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,720
jQuery so every second there's a timer
that updates the time then taking it one

1624
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:45,730
that updates the time then taking it one
 

1625
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,470
that updates the time then taking it one
step further

1626
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
step further
 

1627
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,380
step further
quite often in production we count

1628
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:49,390
quite often in production we count
 

1629
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,900
quite often in production we count
backwards so when we're looking at 10

1630
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:51,910
backwards so when we're looking at 10
 

1631
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,800
backwards so when we're looking at 10
o'clock the time we're counting down to

1632
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:55,810
o'clock the time we're counting down to
 

1633
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,730
o'clock the time we're counting down to
it so we're calling 60 seconds 30

1634
00:35:59,730 --> 00:35:59,740
it so we're calling 60 seconds 30
 

1635
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:05,280
it so we're calling 60 seconds 30
seconds 10 seconds 5 and then everything

1636
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,290
seconds 10 seconds 5 and then everything
 

1637
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,370
seconds 10 seconds 5 and then everything
goes black and boom we're alive so

1638
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:08,380
goes black and boom we're alive so
 

1639
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,930
goes black and boom we're alive so
that's how it works so what we have is

1640
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:09,940
that's how it works so what we have is
 

1641
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,090
that's how it works so what we have is
now and now we've see that it's 947 we

1642
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,100
now and now we've see that it's 947 we
 

1643
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,980
now and now we've see that it's 947 we
can really easily calculate that we've

1644
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:13,990
can really easily calculate that we've
 

1645
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,680
can really easily calculate that we've
got 43 seconds left but if we look down

1646
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:16,690
got 43 seconds left but if we look down
 

1647
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,660
got 43 seconds left but if we look down
here we actually have a countdown that

1648
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:18,670
here we actually have a countdown that
 

1649
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:25,020
here we actually have a countdown that
says time will be 948 in 35 34 33 you

1650
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,030
says time will be 948 in 35 34 33 you
 

1651
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,880
says time will be 948 in 35 34 33 you
can see that jQuery timer is a little

1652
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,890
can see that jQuery timer is a little
 

1653
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,740
can see that jQuery timer is a little
bit off that's also the raspberry pi

1654
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:28,750
bit off that's also the raspberry pi
 

1655
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,860
bit off that's also the raspberry pi
that's not that's not the system itself

1656
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:31,870
that's not that's not the system itself
 

1657
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,690
that's not that's not the system itself
it's that the Raspberry Pi unfortunately

1658
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:33,700
it's that the Raspberry Pi unfortunately
 

1659
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,740
it's that the Raspberry Pi unfortunately
can't keep up with it I was really

1660
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:34,750
can't keep up with it I was really
 

1661
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,030
can't keep up with it I was really
thinking this was going to work on on a

1662
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,040
thinking this was going to work on on a
 

1663
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,150
thinking this was going to work on on a
single board computer I tried it on in

1664
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,160
single board computer I tried it on in
 

1665
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,500
single board computer I tried it on in
this

1666
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:39,510
this
 

1667
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,630
this
use tinker board and it was it was so

1668
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
use tinker board and it was it was so
 

1669
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,000
use tinker board and it was it was so
unable to handle the graphics that it

1670
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,010
unable to handle the graphics that it
 

1671
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,420
unable to handle the graphics that it
actually wouldn't even load them the

1672
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,430
actually wouldn't even load them the
 

1673
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,520
actually wouldn't even load them the
Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus at least loads it

1674
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:52,530
Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus at least loads it
 

1675
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,800
Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus at least loads it
but not well enough so gonna try a

1676
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:54,810
but not well enough so gonna try a
 

1677
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,200
but not well enough so gonna try a
couple of different s pcs reason I'm

1678
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,210
couple of different s pcs reason I'm
 

1679
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,300
couple of different s pcs reason I'm
trying the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ right now

1680
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,310
trying the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ right now
 

1681
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,700
trying the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ right now
is simply it has Wi-Fi which makes it a

1682
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:01,710
is simply it has Wi-Fi which makes it a
 

1683
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,460
is simply it has Wi-Fi which makes it a
little easier to set up because I don't

1684
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,470
little easier to set up because I don't
 

1685
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,900
little easier to set up because I don't
have I haven't unpacked my Ethernet

1686
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:05,910
have I haven't unpacked my Ethernet
 

1687
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,530
have I haven't unpacked my Ethernet
cables yet over here oh and this is not

1688
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:09,540
cables yet over here oh and this is not
 

1689
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,960
cables yet over here oh and this is not
functional either this is just fake part

1690

of the template well I should point out

1692
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:14,280
of the template well I should point out
 

1693
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,600

up here so as I'm recording this as we

00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:17,610
up here so as I'm recording this as we
 

1695
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,890
up here so as I'm recording this as we
mentioned we're not actually

broadcasting live today this is all
 

1699
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,240
broadcasting live today this is all
we've produced this behind like after

1700
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,250
we've produced this behind like after
 

1701
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,210
we've produced this behind like after
the fact so this shows the video feed is

1702
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,220
the fact so this shows the video feed is
 

1703
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,640
the fact so this shows the video feed is
off the air but as soon as we go live

1704
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:28,650
off the air but as soon as we go live
 

1705
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,490
off the air but as soon as we go live
this will actually shift to say on air

1706
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:31,500
this will actually shift to say on air
 

1707
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,800
this will actually shift to say on air
so that also serves a double purpose if

1708
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:33,810
so that also serves a double purpose if
 

1709
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,960
so that also serves a double purpose if
we're here producing and and

00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:40,620
that presumably I mean if we look up
 

1715
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,870
that presumably I mean if we look up
we'll see that we're off the air

we'll see that we're off the air
something's going on even though we

something's going on even though we
 

1719
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,320

1721
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,150

actually show that then this is also

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,160
actually show that then this is also

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,200
looking to do is it's going to connect
to Samba shares on my server and it does

to Samba shares on my server and it does
 

1733
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,040
to Samba shares on my server and it does
a disk check every 15 seconds to see how

00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,050
a disk check every 15 seconds to see how
 

1735
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,140
a disk check every 15 seconds to see how
much disk usage there is and this will

1736
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,150
much disk usage there is and this will
 

1737
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,360
much disk usage there is and this will
move automatically the only one right

move automatically the only one right
 

1739

in real time the animation is so much
 

1751
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,130
in real time the animation is so much
better on a computer so I've got this

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,140
better on a computer so I've got this
 

1753
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,800
better on a computer so I've got this

I'll turn that into my clock but part of

00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,270
I'll turn that into my clock but part of
 

1757
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,360
I'll turn that into my clock but part of
the idea is I want to create a set up

1771
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,350
whether we're on air or off air and it
will even tell us if there's a problem

1772
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:51,360
will even tell us if there's a problem
 

1773
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,420
will even tell us if there's a problem

00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
this will go red and it will warn us of
 

1777
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,920
this will go red and it will warn us of
that right here you see an empty box and

1778
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:57,930
that right here you see an empty box and
 

1779
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,920
that right here you see an empty box and
that's because I have not yet plugged a

1780
00:38:59,920 --> 00:38:59,930
that's because I have not yet plugged a
 

1781
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,350
that's because I have not yet plugged a
microphone into the Raspberry Pi this is

1782
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:03,360
microphone into the Raspberry Pi this is
 

1783
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,760
microphone into the Raspberry Pi this is
a spectrum and now analyzer so that will

1784
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:07,770
a spectrum and now analyzer so that will
 

1785
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,760
a spectrum and now analyzer so that will
actually show the the spectrum in real

1786
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:10,770
actually show the the spectrum in real
 

1787
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,890
actually show the the spectrum in real

1789
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
time of audio that's flowing through the
Raspberry Pi so I'm thinking maybe we'll

1790
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:14,910
Raspberry Pi so I'm thinking maybe we'll
 

1791
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,480
Raspberry Pi so I'm thinking maybe we'll
pull that off of our mixing console so

1792
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:17,490
pull that off of our mixing console so
 

1793
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,370
pull that off of our mixing console so
that we can actually see the audio

1794
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:19,380
that we can actually see the audio
 

1795
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,000
that we can actually see the audio
levels on the on the dashboard so that's

1796
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,010
levels on the on the dashboard so that's
 

1797
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,100
levels on the on the dashboard so that's
pretty cool so that's my new clock it's

1798
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,110
pretty cool so that's my new clock it's
 

1799
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,750
pretty cool so that's my new clock it's
much more than a clock it's a functional

1800
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:26,760
much more than a clock it's a functional
 

1801
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,610
much more than a clock it's a functional

2701
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:21,279

2705
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:26,739
in real time right now so here's the
question that is running through my head

2706
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:26,749
question that is running through my head
 

2707
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:31,469
question that is running through my head
is this a security breach on Twitter or

01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,160
the devices that run those Twitter
 

2713
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,070
the devices that run those Twitter
accounts because the fact that they were

2714
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:39,080
accounts because the fact that they were
 

2715
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,440
accounts because the fact that they were
all fairly simultaneous within minutes

2716
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,450
all fairly simultaneous within minutes
 

2717

of one another
 

2719
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:48,040

again this is just kind of starting to
think outside the box but could there be

2766
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:45,890
think outside the box but could there be
 

2767
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:50,440
think outside the box but could there be
a relation to like a unrelated service

2768
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:50,450
a relation to like a unrelated service
 

2769
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:53,610
a relation to like a unrelated service
where there's some sort of phishing

2770
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:53,620
where there's some sort of phishing
 

2771
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,990
where there's some sort of phishing
program that's collecting information

2772
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
program that's collecting information
 

2773
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,660
program that's collecting information
where all of them are using it like I

2774
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:58,670
where all of them are using it like I
 

2775
01:02:58,670 --> 01:02:59,950
where all of them are using it like I
know we covered in the news couple weeks

2776
01:02:59,950 --> 01:02:59,960
know we covered in the news couple weeks
 

2777
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,080
know we covered in the news couple weeks
ago about discord that there's BOTS on

2778
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:02,090
ago about discord that there's BOTS on
 

2779
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:06,280
ago about discord that there's BOTS on
the rise or could it be like I'm just

2780
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:06,290
the rise or could it be like I'm just
 

2781
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,360
the rise or could it be like I'm just
trying to think of something because I

2782
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:07,370
trying to think of something because I
 

2783
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:09,280
trying to think of something because I
mean a lot of those are tech based we

2784
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:09,290
mean a lot of those are tech based we
 

2785
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,470
mean a lot of those are tech based we
can speculate Jeff we don't know at

2786
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:11,480
can speculate Jeff we don't know at
 

2787
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,840
can speculate Jeff we don't know at
least at the time of filming yeah we

2788
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:13,850
least at the time of filming yeah we
 

2789
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,150
least at the time of filming yeah we
don't know yeah there's absolutely a

2790
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,160
don't know yeah there's absolutely a
 

2791
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,190
don't know yeah there's absolutely a
possibility of like I think spearfishing

2792
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:18,200
possibility of like I think spearfishing
 

2793
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,550
possibility of like I think spearfishing
is a very real possibility

2794
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:20,560
is a very real possibility

whereas the two FA right and that
 

2923
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:25,070
whereas the two FA right and that
absolutely makes sense

2924
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:25,080
absolutely makes sense
 

2925
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,690
absolutely makes sense
absolutely Google Authenticator on the

2926
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:27,700
absolutely Google Authenticator on the
 

2927
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,640
absolutely Google Authenticator on the
other hand and I say that because that's

2928
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:29,650
other hand and I say that because that's
 

2929
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,130
other hand and I say that because that's
a very common one there are other

2930
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:32,140
a very common one there are other
 

2931
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,830
a very common one there are other
Authenticator apps or a single-use

2932
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:34,840
Authenticator apps or a single-use
 

2933
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,710
Authenticator apps or a single-use
password one-time password OTP apps

2934
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:37,720
password one-time password OTP apps
 

2935
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,070
password one-time password OTP apps
available but they generate a password

2936
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:41,080
available but they generate a password
 

2937
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,810
available but they generate a password
and they refresh every 15 seconds or

2938
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:42,820
and they refresh every 15 seconds or
 

2939
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,180
and they refresh every 15 seconds or
something like that so it it makes sure

2940
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:45,190
something like that so it it makes sure
 

2941
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,130
something like that so it it makes sure
that that one-time password is only

2942
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:47,140
that that one-time password is only
 

2943
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,380
that that one-time password is only
available for 15 seconds yeah so if you

2944
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:49,390
available for 15 seconds yeah so if you
 

2945
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:50,700
available for 15 seconds yeah so if you
don't have your phone you're not getting

2948
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:54,520
in and you really do need multi-factor
 

2949
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,760

and one of my comments was like if you

2970
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:26,320
and one of my comments was like if you
 

2971
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,920
and one of my comments was like if you
had a device that had a bunch of data on

2972
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:28,930
had a device that had a bunch of data on
 

2973
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,420
had a device that had a bunch of data on
it and you left it on your car seat and

2974
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:30,430
it and you left it on your car seat and
 

2975
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:34,349
it and you left it on your car seat and
someone stole it would one would you

2976
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:34,359
someone stole it would one would you
 

2977
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:37,500
someone stole it would one would you
lose any of the data and two would they

2978
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:37,510
lose any of the data and two would they
 

2979
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:40,200
lose any of the data and two would they
gain access to that data and the answer

2980
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:40,210
gain access to that data and the answer
 

2981
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:41,970
gain access to that data and the answer
to both of those questions should be no

2982
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:41,980
to both of those questions should be no
 

2983
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,430
to both of those questions should be no
correct and that encryption should be

2984
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:46,440
correct and that encryption should be
 

2985
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,080
correct and that encryption should be
authentication enabled you should have

2986
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:49,090
authentication enabled you should have
 

2987
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,359
authentication enabled you should have
two FA in order to be able to access the

2988
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:51,369
two FA in order to be able to access the
 

2989
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:52,980
two FA in order to be able to access the
data so even if they figure out the

2990
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:52,990
data so even if they figure out the
 

2991
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,530
data so even if they figure out the
decryption they don't have your phone

2992
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:55,540
decryption they don't have your phone
 

2993
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,630
decryption they don't have your phone
they don't have your Authenticator app

2994
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:57,640
they don't have your Authenticator app
 

2995
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,020
they don't have your Authenticator app
so they can't gain access to that data

2996
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:01,030
so they can't gain access to that data
 

2997
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,660
so they can't gain access to that data
that's very very important these days

so no huge developments in this area

3318
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:02,940
so no huge developments in this area
 

3319
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,660
so no huge developments in this area
here but if we sort by seven days then

here but if we sort by seven days then
 

3321
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,160
here but if we sort by seven days then
we see that we had some coins that

3322
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:07,170
we see that we had some coins that
 

3323
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,550
we see that we had some coins that
increased by over 100% like Elrond dibi

01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
increased by over 100% like Elrond dibi
 

3325
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,670
increased by over 100% like Elrond dibi
60 percent over twenty coins increased

3326
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:13,680
60 percent over twenty coins increased
 

3327
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,130
60 percent over twenty coins increased
more than 15-percent and only four coins

3328
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:16,140
more than 15-percent and only four coins
 

3329
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:19,760
more than 15-percent and only four coins
lost more than fifteen percent so a

3330
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:19,770
lost more than fifteen percent so a
 

3331
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:22,460
lost more than fifteen percent so a
positive development from that point of

3332
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:22,470
positive development from that point of
 

3333
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:25,010
positive development from that point of
view in the market if we look we compare

3334
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:25,020
view in the market if we look we compare
 

3335
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:30,770
view in the market if we look we compare
for example the history of the big coins

3336
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:30,780
for example the history of the big coins
 

3337
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,430
for example the history of the big coins
in the defy market like maker or or

3338
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:34,440
in the defy market like maker or or
 

3339
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,930
in the defy market like maker or or
khyber or 0x when compared with the

3340
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:38,940
khyber or 0x when compared with the
 

3341
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,990
khyber or 0x when compared with the
profit of theorem then we'll see that

3342
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
profit of theorem then we'll see that
 

3343
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,180
profit of theorem then we'll see that
the theorem state more or less flat at

3344
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:44,190
the theorem state more or less flat at
 

3345
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:48,380
the theorem state more or less flat at
0% so I lost minus 0.3 percent but all

3346
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:48,390
0% so I lost minus 0.3 percent but all
 

3347
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,180
0% so I lost minus 0.3 percent but all
these others gained over thousand

3348
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:50,190
these others gained over thousand
 

3349
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,370
these others gained over thousand
percent so huge development that is

3350
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:52,380
percent so huge development that is
 

3351
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,080
percent so huge development that is
happening under the hood in the crypto

3352
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:54,090
happening under the hood in the crypto
 

3353
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,390
happening under the hood in the crypto
market and so one has to be careful also

3354
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
market and so one has to be careful also
 

3355
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,330

with these things don't participate

3410
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:10,170
with these things don't participate
 

3411
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:12,799
with these things don't participate
there the moment you hear about some

3412
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:12,809
there the moment you hear about some
 

3413
01:17:12,809 --> 01:17:15,229
there the moment you hear about some
pump it will still be too late again

3414
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:15,239
pump it will still be too late again
 

3415
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:17,629
pump it will still be too late again
because those that started that pump are

3416
01:17:17,629 --> 01:17:17,639
because those that started that pump are
 

3417
01:17:17,639 --> 01:17:20,299
because those that started that pump are
already planning on how to leave that

3418
01:17:20,299 --> 01:17:20,309
already planning on how to leave that
 

3419
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:25,910
already planning on how to leave that
one next is if we look into compound and

3420
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:25,920
one next is if we look into compound and
 

3421
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,330
one next is if we look into compound and
if we want to borrow rent some money and

3422
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:29,340
if we want to borrow rent some money and
 

3423
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,189
if we want to borrow rent some money and
then there is some collateral factor in

3424
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
then there is some collateral factor in
 

3425
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,169
then there is some collateral factor in
here yeah so sixty percent in other

3426
01:17:33,169 --> 01:17:33,179
here yeah so sixty percent in other
 

3427
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:37,310
here yeah so sixty percent in other
words if I put in 100 percent then I can

3428
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:37,320
words if I put in 100 percent then I can
 

3429
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,160
words if I put in 100 percent then I can
take sixty percent out so there's over

3430
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:40,170
take sixty percent out so there's over
 

3431
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,740
take sixty percent out so there's over
an over collateralization in in this

3432
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:42,750
an over collateralization in in this
 

3433
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,189
an over collateralization in in this
industry and that's how most of these

3434
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:45,199
industry and that's how most of these
 

3435
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:49,399
industry and that's how most of these
are staying on a fairly low risk basis

3436
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:49,409
are staying on a fairly low risk basis
 

3437
01:17:49,409 --> 01:17:52,310
are staying on a fairly low risk basis
but there has been a new development of

3438
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
but there has been a new development of
 

3439
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,220
but there has been a new development of
is the first one that is starting now

3440
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:54,230
is the first one that is starting now
 

3441
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:57,649
is the first one that is starting now
with credit ik credit allocation so in

3442
01:17:57,649 --> 01:17:57,659
with credit ik credit allocation so in
 

3443
01:17:57,659 --> 01:17:59,540
with credit ik credit allocation so in
other words you can have a credit

3444
01:17:59,540 --> 01:17:59,550
other words you can have a credit
 

3445
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,339
other words you can have a credit
without even putting up some collateral

3446
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:01,349
without even putting up some collateral
 

3447
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:03,979
without even putting up some collateral
and the way they solve that is that you

3448
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:03,989
and the way they solve that is that you
 

3449
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:06,500
and the way they solve that is that you
have to sign a contract with a person

3450
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:06,510
have to sign a contract with a person
 

3451
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,990
have to sign a contract with a person
that gives you all whom you give the

3452
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:09,000
that gives you all whom you give the
 

3453
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,779
that gives you all whom you give the
money and it will be sorted out in an

3454
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:11,789
money and it will be sorted out in an
 

3455
01:18:11,789 --> 01:18:14,750
money and it will be sorted out in an
illegal or regular court in case there

3456
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:14,760
illegal or regular court in case there
 

3457
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,549
illegal or regular court in case there
is a default so that's an interesting

3458
01:18:16,549 --> 01:18:16,559
is a default so that's an interesting
 

3459
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:19,700
is a default so that's an interesting
development I find now another

3460
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:19,710
development I find now another
 

3461
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:21,259
development I find now another
interesting development but more on the

3462
01:18:21,259 --> 01:18:21,269
interesting development but more on the
 

3463
01:18:21,269 --> 01:18:23,509
interesting development but more on the
negative side or not negative but one

3464
01:18:23,509 --> 01:18:23,519
negative side or not negative but one
 

3465
01:18:23,519 --> 01:18:26,029
negative side or not negative but one
has to be careful is tether as you

3466
01:18:26,029 --> 01:18:26,039
has to be careful is tether as you
 

3467

has to be careful is tether as you
remember tether has got from the 24-hour

volume it's number two or usually number
 

3471
01:18:33,449 --> 01:18:34,790
volume it's number two or usually number
one so you see it's very close to a

3472
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
one so you see it's very close to a
 

3473
