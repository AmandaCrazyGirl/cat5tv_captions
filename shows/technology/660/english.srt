but there's been
 

311
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,629
but there's been
such a such a slow adoption in the

312
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
such a such a slow adoption in the
 

313
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,110
such a such a slow adoption in the
older community and i'll say the older

314
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
older community and i'll say the older
 

315
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,990
older community and i'll say the older
community but

316
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
community but
 

317
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,790
community but
like the those of us who you know were

318
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
like the those of us who you know were
 

319
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,189
like the those of us who you know were
working with computers in the 80s 90s

320
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
working with computers in the 80s 90s
 

321
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,510
working with computers in the 80s 90s
it's i think maybe that's a

322
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
it's i think maybe that's a
 

323
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,790
it's i think maybe that's a
generalization maybe that's

324
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
generalization maybe that's
 

325
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,230
generalization maybe that's
us here in canada maybe it's a little

326
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
us here in canada maybe it's a little
 

327
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,070
us here in canada maybe it's a little
different down down south but

328
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
different down down south but
 

329
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,110
different down down south but
um i find that we're very slow to adopt

330
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
um i find that we're very slow to adopt
 

331
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,710
um i find that we're very slow to adopt
these types of technologies because it

332
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
these types of technologies because it
 

333
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,189
these types of technologies because it
seems like a fly by night it could fail

334
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
seems like a fly by night it could fail
 

335
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,430
seems like a fly by night it could fail
it could disappear but now i'm seeing

336
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
it could disappear but now i'm seeing
 

337
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,510
it could disappear but now i'm seeing
the reality of hey 3d printing you can

338
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
the reality of hey 3d printing you can
 

339
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,270

i think also the the big challenge with
 

343
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,950
i think also the the big challenge with
3d print printing at the

344
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
3d print printing at the
 

345
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,469
3d print printing at the
onset was the cost like if you wanted to

can't so
 

429
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,749
can't so
but you can get a 3d printer at home

so awesome
 

449
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,710
so awesome
and i'm thinking about okay so now we

450
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
and i'm thinking about okay so now we
 

451
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,309
and i'm thinking about okay so now we
are in a situation at home

452
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
are in a situation at home
 

453
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,950
are in a situation at home
i mean the kids are supposedly maybe

454
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
i mean the kids are supposedly maybe
 

455
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,150

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
going back to school i don't know if
 

457
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,430
going back to school i don't know if
that's a good idea

458
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
that's a good idea
 

459
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,390
that's a good idea
but if they do they have to wear masks

460
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
but if they do they have to wear masks
 

461
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,629
but if they do they have to wear masks
it's mandated we have to wear masks

462
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
it's mandated we have to wear masks

the only reason we're able to take our
 

469
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,990
the only reason we're able to take our
masks off right now is because we're

470
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
masks off right now is because we're
 

471
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,070
masks off right now is because we're
distant from one another and i'm

472
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
distant from one another and i'm

703
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,590
hook you up and do some of the work for
me the whole point

704
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
me the whole point
 

705
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,710
me the whole point
i'll stand back is 500

706
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
i'll stand back is 500
 

707
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,949
i'll stand back is 500
500 paintballs yeah they pelted with

708
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
500 paintballs yeah they pelted with
 

709
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,069
500 paintballs yeah they pelted with
sasha was gonna

710
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
sasha was gonna
 

711
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,230
sasha was gonna
shoot me so we got to get her back here

712
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
shoot me so we got to get her back here
 

713
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,629
shoot me so we got to get her back here
exactly but see our borders are closed

714
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
exactly but see our borders are closed
 

715
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,110
exactly but see our borders are closed
at the province level so she can't get

716
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
at the province level so she can't get
 

717
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,110
at the province level so she can't get
out of her province into our province

718
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
out of her province into our province
 

719
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,629
out of her province into our province
because she's had to move out east

720
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
because she's had to move out east
 

721
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,509
because she's had to move out east
too bad there wasn't a way to like

722
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
too bad there wasn't a way to like
 

723
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,750
too bad there wasn't a way to like
simulate

724
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
simulate
 

725
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,949
simulate
like uh use a raspberry pi with a 3d

726
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
like uh use a raspberry pi with a 3d
 

727
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,550
like uh use a raspberry pi with a 3d
printer i thought about this too

728
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
printer i thought about this too
 

729
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,030
printer i thought about this too
a 3d printer to create a device that

730
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
a 3d printer to create a device that
 

731
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,030
a 3d printer to create a device that
would allow remote shooting

732
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
would allow remote shooting
 

733
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,310
would allow remote shooting
through the app of a paintball gun

734
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
through the app of a paintball gun
 

735
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,069
through the app of a paintball gun
so that sasha could do it remotely but

736
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
so that sasha could do it remotely but
 

737
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,389
so that sasha could do it remotely but
then i thought if ever i created such a

738
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
then i thought if ever i created such a
 

739
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:46,870
then i thought if ever i created such a
thing

740
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
thing
 

741
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,430
thing
i am opening a pandora's box because i

742
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
i am opening a pandora's box because i
 

743
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,190
i am opening a pandora's box because i
don't want to be involved

744
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
don't want to be involved
 

745
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,230
don't want to be involved
in creating a remote

746
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
in creating a remote
 

747
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,870
in creating a remote
targeting and shooting system so it's

748
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
targeting and shooting system so it's
 

749
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,590
targeting and shooting system so it's
like there's

750
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
like there's
 

751
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,509
like there's
uh i don't well just don't put it on

it'd be neat if we could do that for a

792
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
it'd be neat if we could do that for a
 

793
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,470
it'd be neat if we could do that for a
program

794
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
program
 

795
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,350
program

uh arduino is neat because you can
 

1091
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,310
uh arduino is neat because you can
connect it to the gpio or the

1092
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
connect it to the gpio or the
 

1093

the sensors and things like that and be
 

1095
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,510
the sensors and things like that and be
able to do some really cool things

1096
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
able to do some really cool things
 

1097
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,029
able to do some really cool things
we've done a couple of things like the

1098
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
we've done a couple of things like the
 

1099
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,710
we've done a couple of things like the
thermal sensor yeah i could see your

1100
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
thermal sensor yeah i could see your
 

1101
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,190
thermal sensor yeah i could see your
hand

1102
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
hand
 

1103
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,630

and then i'm thinking we could use that
 

1105
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,390
and then i'm thinking we could use that
we could use that to to

1106
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
we could use that to to
 

1107
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,909
we could use that to to
check people's temperature by pointing

1108
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
check people's temperature by pointing
 

1109

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,310
is the inner diameter so when you're
ordering it that's the size of the hole

1288
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
ordering it that's the size of the hole
 

1289
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,230
ordering it that's the size of the hole
not the actual size that's going to be

1290
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240
not the actual size that's going to be
 

1291
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,149
not the actual size that's going to be
required for the hole through your wall

1292
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
required for the hole through your wall
 

1293
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,870
required for the hole through your wall
so just keep that in mind um in addition

1294
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
so just keep that in mind um in addition
 

1295
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,830
so just keep that in mind um in addition
to that

1296
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
to that
 

1297
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,909
to that
the thickness of your wall can be

1298
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
the thickness of your wall can be
 

1299
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,830
the thickness of your wall can be
anywhere from 0.4

1300
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
anywhere from 0.4
 

1301
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,350
anywhere from 0.4
inches so very very small

1302
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
inches so very very small
 

1303
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,430
inches so very very small
to 16.15 inches so the smaller one is

1304
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
to 16.15 inches so the smaller one is
 

1305
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,630
to 16.15 inches so the smaller one is
really ideal

1306
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
really ideal
 

1307
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,950
really ideal
for say something like the ceiling tile

1308
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
for say something like the ceiling tile
 

1309
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,149
for say something like the ceiling tile
so this is going to be great when we're

1310
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
so this is going to be great when we're
 

1311
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:32,549
so this is going to be great when we're
doing

1312
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
doing
 

1313
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,190

that with a drop ceiling
 

1319
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,070
that with a drop ceiling
this will go perfectly on the tile so

1320
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
this will go perfectly on the tile so
 

1321
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,750
this will go perfectly on the tile so
you just drill the hole screw it

1322
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
you just drill the hole screw it
 

1323
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,950
you just drill the hole screw it
together and you've got this

that down if you wanted to
 

1447
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,510
that down if you wanted to
you could paint them if you wanted to

1448
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:43,520
you could paint them if you wanted to
 

1449
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,789
you could paint them if you wanted to
but again

1450
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
but again
 

1451
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,470
but again
the imperfections are just because of

1452
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
the imperfections are just because of
 

1453
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,870
the imperfections are just because of
the 3d print and i think that is

1454
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
the 3d print and i think that is
 

1455
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,750
the 3d print and i think that is
very very good and in fact this you know

1456
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
very very good and in fact this you know
 

1457
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,630
very very good and in fact this you know
i'm i'm

1458
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
i'm i'm
 

1459
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,230
i'm i'm
quite impressed with this it's it's

1460
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
quite impressed with this it's it's
 

1461
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,909
quite impressed with this it's it's
really really good quality

1462
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
really really good quality
 

1463
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,630
really really good quality
and exactly what i needed so let's see

1464
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
and exactly what i needed so let's see
 

1465
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,070
and exactly what i needed so let's see
how easy it really is

1466
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
how easy it really is
 

1467
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,630
how easy it really is
and get the easy portal installed so

1468
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
and get the easy portal installed so
 

1469
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,510
and get the easy portal installed so
that's the hole

1470
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
that's the hole
 

1471
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,390
that's the hole
in the on the bridge our production room

1472
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,400
in the on the bridge our production room
 

1473
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,190
in the on the bridge our production room
leading out

1474
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
leading out
 

1475
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,990
leading out
into the main studio so um so you can

1476
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
into the main studio so um so you can
 

1477
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,510
into the main studio so um so you can
see all the wires here

1478
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
see all the wires here
 

1479
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,230
see all the wires here
going in through the uh the pipe yep

1480
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
going in through the uh the pipe yep
 

1481
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,350
going in through the uh the pipe yep
so we'll just pull that through and

1482
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
so we'll just pull that through and
 

1483
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,230
so we'll just pull that through and
no effort whatsoever to do uh to do the

1484
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
no effort whatsoever to do uh to do the
 

1485
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,590
no effort whatsoever to do uh to do the
installation you'll see but

1486
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
installation you'll see but
 

1487
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,269
installation you'll see but
uh for me it's just getting all this

1488
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:25,279
uh for me it's just getting all this
 

1489
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,870
uh for me it's just getting all this
stuff out of the way man

1490
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
stuff out of the way man
 

1491
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,070
stuff out of the way man
i forgot how big and bulky that pipe was

1492
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
i forgot how big and bulky that pipe was
 

1493
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,350
i forgot how big and bulky that pipe was
oh jeff all right all right

1494
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
oh jeff all right all right
 

1495
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,710
oh jeff all right all right
speaking of big and bulky check out our

1496
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
speaking of big and bulky check out our
 

1497
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,549
speaking of big and bulky check out our
old lights that's right now we're all

1498
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
old lights that's right now we're all
 

1499
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,630
old lights that's right now we're all
led so anybody want to buy some

1500
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
led so anybody want to buy some
 

1501
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,870
led so anybody want to buy some
some old lights now here i'm actually

1502
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
some old lights now here i'm actually
 

1503
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,870
some old lights now here i'm actually
kind of measuring all scientific like

1504
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
kind of measuring all scientific like
 

1505
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,269
kind of measuring all scientific like
uh the size of the flange to make sure

1506
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
uh the size of the flange to make sure
 

1507
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:45,909
uh the size of the flange to make sure
that the whole

1508
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
that the whole
 

1509
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,310
that the whole
because i did pre-drill a hole for the

1510
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
because i did pre-drill a hole for the
 

1511
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,990
because i did pre-drill a hole for the
pipe so i needed to actually

1512
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
pipe so i needed to actually
 

1513
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,710
pipe so i needed to actually
make this hole a little bit higher which

1514
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
make this hole a little bit higher which
 

1515
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,990
make this hole a little bit higher which
is a little bit difficult because i

1516
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
is a little bit difficult because i
 

1517
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,269
is a little bit difficult because i
already had a hole there but

1518
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
already had a hole there but
 

1519
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,190
already had a hole there but
i i was able to just kind of quickly

1520
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
i i was able to just kind of quickly
 

1521
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,029
i i was able to just kind of quickly
figure out how much room i needed for

1522
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
figure out how much room i needed for
 

1523
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,750
figure out how much room i needed for
the flange

1524
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
the flange
 

1525
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,029
the flange
and you can see on the other side and

1526
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
and you can see on the other side and
 

1527
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,390
and you can see on the other side and
now there's actually a little bit of a

1528
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
now there's actually a little bit of a
 

1529
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,990
now there's actually a little bit of a
broken space

1530
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
broken space
 

1531
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,230
broken space
on the lower part of the other side of

1532
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
on the lower part of the other side of
 

1533
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,510
on the lower part of the other side of
the wall you'll see that in a moment

1534
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
the wall you'll see that in a moment
 

1535
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:07,830
the wall you'll see that in a moment
here

1536
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
here
 

1537
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,950
here
even better jeff um man it's nice and

1538
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
even better jeff um man it's nice and
 

1539
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,830
even better jeff um man it's nice and
flush

1540
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:11,840
flush
 

1541
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,470
flush
yeah so but here on the other side so i

1542
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
yeah so but here on the other side so i
 

1543
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,990
yeah so but here on the other side so i
came through from that side so that it

1544
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
came through from that side so that it
 

1545
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,110
came through from that side so that it
would line up really well

1546
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
would line up really well
 

1547
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,750
would line up really well
yeah but i think that um previously

1548
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760
yeah but i think that um previously
 

1549
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,230
yeah but i think that um previously
there was

1550
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,240
there was
 

1551
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,669
there was
some there was another hole there that

1552
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
some there was another hole there that
 

1553
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,430
some there was another hole there that
wasn't patched properly so that's why it

1554
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
wasn't patched properly so that's why it
 

1555
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,990
wasn't patched properly so that's why it
kind of cracked

1556
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
kind of cracked
 

1557
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,710
kind of cracked
at the bottom there right however my i'm

1558
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
at the bottom there right however my i'm
 

1559
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,669
at the bottom there right however my i'm
lucky

1560
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:27,679
lucky
 

1561
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,110
lucky
because the flange is big enough to

1562
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
because the flange is big enough to
 

1563
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,350
because the flange is big enough to
cover that so even though

1564
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
cover that so even though
 

1565
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,669
cover that so even though
you can see how bad it looks right there

1566
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
you can see how bad it looks right there
 

1567
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,789
you can see how bad it looks right there
on the other side of the wall

1568
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
on the other side of the wall
 

1569
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,789
on the other side of the wall
it covers it up yeah the flange is big

1570
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
it covers it up yeah the flange is big
 

1571
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,470
it covers it up yeah the flange is big
enough that it uh that it

1572
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
enough that it uh that it
 

1573
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,909
enough that it uh that it
really does cover up any of those kind

1574
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
really does cover up any of those kind
 

1575
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,789
really does cover up any of those kind
of like the damage look

1576
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
of like the damage look
 

1577
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,750
of like the damage look
see that wow that fits so smoothly it's

1578
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
see that wow that fits so smoothly it's
 

1579
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,230
see that wow that fits so smoothly it's
perfect

1580
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
perfect
 

1581
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,510
perfect
so that looks and i like that it covers

1582
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
so that looks and i like that it covers
 

1583
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,029
so that looks and i like that it covers
up my

1584
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,039
up my
 

1585
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,630
up my
horrible hack job but so super simple so

1586
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
horrible hack job but so super simple so
 

1587
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,830
horrible hack job but so super simple so
i'm just

1588
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,840
i'm just
 

1589
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,269
i'm just
do it by hand and we wondered if it

1590
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
do it by hand and we wondered if it
 

1591
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,630
do it by hand and we wondered if it
would spin and i needed someone on the

1592
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:58,640
would spin and i needed someone on the
 

1593
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,669
would spin and i needed someone on the
other side and nope

1594
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
other side and nope
 

1595
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,350
other side and nope
it worked perfectly incredible so i'm

1596
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
it worked perfectly incredible so i'm
 

1597
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,269
it worked perfectly incredible so i'm
pushing that through

1598
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
pushing that through
 

1599
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,470
pushing that through
so much easier now to run cable um

1600
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
so much easier now to run cable um
 

1601
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,909
so much easier now to run cable um
through the wall and it's only going

1602
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
through the wall and it's only going
 

1603
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,350
through the wall and it's only going
through that wall i don't have to feed

1604
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
through that wall i don't have to feed

so this is how you read the my plus two
percent and a minus two percent it's a

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,950
percent and a minus two percent it's a
it's an interesting number if you want

android phones so you know i hate to put

3706
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:48,400
android phones so you know i hate to put
 

3707
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,309
android phones so you know i hate to put
the thought in people's heads but this

the thought in people's heads but this
 

3709
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,750
the thought in people's heads but this
is the thing with

3710

is the thing with
 

3711
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,829
is the thing with
an android-based system such as this

3712
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:53,839
an android-based system such as this
 

3713
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,990
an android-based system such as this
while it sounds amazing well it sounds

3714
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
while it sounds amazing well it sounds
 

3715
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,230
while it sounds amazing well it sounds
like

3716
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:56,240
like
 

3717
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,109
like
hey this is a very brilliant idea

3718
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:01,119

 

3719
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,910

how hard is it to take a raspberry pi

3720
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:03,920
how hard is it to take a raspberry pi
 

3721
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,430
how hard is it to take a raspberry pi
zero

3722
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:05,440
zero
 

3723
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,870
zero
and a motor and connect it

3724
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:08,880
and a motor and connect it
 

3725
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,910
and a motor and connect it
to one centralized server

3726
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
to one centralized server
 

3727
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,430
to one centralized server
and share the diagrams of that online

3728
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:15,440
and share the diagrams of that online
 

3729
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,470
and share the diagrams of that online
and say okay everybody i want you to to

3730
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:18,480
and say okay everybody i want you to to
 

3731
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,470
and say okay everybody i want you to to
build this take a raspberry pi plug it

3732
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
build this take a raspberry pi plug it
 

3733
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,390

into this motor put your phone in this

3734
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,400
into this motor put your phone in this
 

3735
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,150
into this motor put your phone in this
motor when you go to bed

3736
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
motor when you go to bed
 

3737
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,950
motor when you go to bed
and because it's internet connected they

3738
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:26,960
and because it's internet connected they
 

3739
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,670
and because it's internet connected they
can make it

3740
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:27,680
can make it
 

3741
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,430
can make it
they can set off all the phones

3742
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:29,440
they can set off all the phones
 

3743
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,990
they can set off all the phones
vibrating like this in any area of the

3744
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:32,000
vibrating like this in any area of the
 

3745
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,829
vibrating like this in any area of the
world where they have these devices

3746
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
world where they have these devices
 

3747
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,309
world where they have these devices
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such

3748
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:36,319
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such
 

3749
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,789
it'd be so easy it'd just be it's such
an easy hack so it's like

3750
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:38,799
an easy hack so it's like
 

3751
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:41,670
an easy hack so it's like
how can they trust that data well i

3752
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:41,680
how can they trust that data well i
 

3753
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,069
how can they trust that data well i
think it's

3754
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
think it's
 

3755
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,630
think it's
brilliant an accelerometer to detect

3756
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:44,640
brilliant an accelerometer to detect
 

3757

like pick a spot and make an earthquake
 

3799
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,670
like pick a spot and make an earthquake
on google maps because

3800

on google maps because
 

3801
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,150
on google maps because
you know it's just so it it'll be
