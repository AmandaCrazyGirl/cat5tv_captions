00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,869
because i've got
my own internal dns server but the

00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
my own internal dns server but the
 

161
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,830
my own internal dns server but the
problem is is that

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
problem is is that
 

163
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,830
problem is is that
the routing still has to go through the

164
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
the routing still has to go through the
 

165
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,270
the routing still has to go through the
isp that's right yeah

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,670
isp that's right yeah
so if their internal dns is not

168
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
so if their internal dns is not
 

169
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,869
so if their internal dns is not
responding then

170
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
responding then
 

171
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,869
responding then
all of a sudden it breaks down somewhere

172
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
all of a sudden it breaks down somewhere
 

173
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,390
all of a sudden it breaks down somewhere
in toronto

174
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
in toronto
 

175
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,589
in toronto
and uh and and here we here we are yes

176
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
and uh and and here we here we are yes
 

177
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,030
and uh and and here we here we are yes
and i understand there's been some

178
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
and i understand there's been some
 

179
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,309
and i understand there's been some
issues with uh aws amazon web services

180
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
issues with uh aws amazon web services
 

181
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,910
issues with uh aws amazon web services
in the uk as well

182
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
in the uk as well
 

183
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,509
in the uk as well
um so if that's affected you that's

184
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
um so if that's affected you that's
 

185
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,750
um so if that's affected you that's
really tough and and it's a

186
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
really tough and and it's a
 

187
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,670
really tough and and it's a
it's an interesting thing like we're

188
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
it's an interesting thing like we're
 

189
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,030
it's an interesting thing like we're
we're so cloud-based

190
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
we're so cloud-based
 

191
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,710
we're so cloud-based
now and you say you know what is the

192
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
now and you say you know what is the
 

193
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,630
now and you say you know what is the
cloud well really it's just a grouping

194
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
cloud well really it's just a grouping
 

195
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,430
cloud well really it's just a grouping
of

196
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
of
 

197
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,670
of
very very powerful servers aws being

198
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
very very powerful servers aws being
 

199
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,509
very very powerful servers aws being
one of the world's largest because

200
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
one of the world's largest because
 

201
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,110
one of the world's largest because
amazon is huge and

202
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
amazon is huge and
 

203
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,710
amazon is huge and
aws is their cloud platform for host

204
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
aws is their cloud platform for host
 

205
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,229
aws is their cloud platform for host
like hosts um so you know my websites

206
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
like hosts um so you know my websites
 

207
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,110
like hosts um so you know my websites
are

208
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
are
 

209
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,270
are
largely you know our back end is powered

210
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
largely you know our back end is powered
 

211
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,070
largely you know our back end is powered
by amazon web services so uh

212
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
by amazon web services so uh
 

213
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,030
by amazon web services so uh
fortunately here in canada uh we weren't

214
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
fortunately here in canada uh we weren't
 

215
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,910
fortunately here in canada uh we weren't
affected

216
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
affected
 

217
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,350
affected
but those who are hosting on aws

218
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
but those who are hosting on aws
 

219
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,990
but those who are hosting on aws
i believe it was in the uk that i think

220
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
i believe it was in the uk that i think
 

221
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,869
i believe it was in the uk that i think
that's correct

222
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
that's correct
 

223
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,789
that's correct
it was down so their servers are

224
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
it was down so their servers are
 

225
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,990
it was down so their servers are
completely down

226
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
completely down
 

227
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,830
completely down
so you've got infrastructure that is

228
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
so you've got infrastructure that is
 

229
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,469
so you've got infrastructure that is
built upon this platform that you expect

230
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
built upon this platform that you expect
 

231
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,150
built upon this platform that you expect
is always going to be up

232
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
is always going to be up
 

233
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,870
is always going to be up
and it's not that's right necessarily

234
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
and it's not that's right necessarily
 

235
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,710
and it's not that's right necessarily
google had it happen where a lightning

236
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
google had it happen where a lightning
 

237
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,270
google had it happen where a lightning
strike

238
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
strike
 

239
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,990
strike
actually took down some of their cloud

240
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
actually took down some of their cloud
 

241
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,510
actually took down some of their cloud
that's right a couple years ago

242
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
that's right a couple years ago
 

243
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,030
that's right a couple years ago
yeah but it resulted in like a 0.0001

244
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
yeah but it resulted in like a 0.0001
 

245
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,310
yeah but it resulted in like a 0.0001
percent i don't know if that's the

246
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
percent i don't know if that's the
 

247
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,510
percent i don't know if that's the
actual number but

248
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
actual number but
 

249
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,189
actual number but
data loss at their data center and so

250
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
data loss at their data center and so
 

251
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,310
data loss at their data center and so
that's it yes but when you consider the

252
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
that's it yes but when you consider the
 

253
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,430
that's it yes but when you consider the
scale of google

254
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
scale of google
 

255
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,830
scale of google
yeah fair enough okay it can be huge

256
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
yeah fair enough okay it can be huge
 

257
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,870
yeah fair enough okay it can be huge
right that's true

258
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
right that's true
 

259
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,990
right that's true
so and the advantages i guess with

260
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
so and the advantages i guess with
 

261
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,510
so and the advantages i guess with
cloud hosting is that well partly

262
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
cloud hosting is that well partly
 

263
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,670
cloud hosting is that well partly
you've got a little bit of an out if

264
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
you've got a little bit of an out if
 

265
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,710
you've got a little bit of an out if
something goes down

266
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
something goes down
 

267
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,350
something goes down
yeah as a as a provider as a service

268
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
yeah as a as a provider as a service
 

269
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,189
yeah as a as a provider as a service
provider you're able to

270
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
provider you're able to
 

271
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,749
provider you're able to
okay well you know there's a pretty

272
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
okay well you know there's a pretty
 

273
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,390
okay well you know there's a pretty
large

274
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
large
 

275
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,830
large
amount of sites that are affected by an

276
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
amount of sites that are affected by an
 

277
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,870
amount of sites that are affected by an
outage

278
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
outage
 

279
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,510
outage
at amazon web services for sure yeah if

280
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
at amazon web services for sure yeah if
 

281
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,790
at amazon web services for sure yeah if
you self-host

282
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
you self-host
 

283
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,469
you self-host
and your server goes down there's no

284
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
and your server goes down there's no
 

285
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,830
and your server goes down there's no
excuses

286
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
excuses
 

287
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,310
excuses
it all falls on you but there's a

288
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
it all falls on you but there's a
 

289
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,270
it all falls on you but there's a
certain level

290
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
certain level
 

291
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,870
certain level
of i guess like community understanding

292
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
of i guess like community understanding
 

293
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,670
of i guess like community understanding
that hey

294
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
that hey
 

295
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,950
that hey
oh well if aws is down in the uk

296
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
oh well if aws is down in the uk
 

297
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,590
oh well if aws is down in the uk
and i can't access your uk-based website

299
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,110
and i can't access your uk-based website
that's hosted there then

300
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
that's hosted there then
 

301
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,189
that's hosted there then
uh it's amazon's fault it'll be back up

302
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
uh it's amazon's fault it'll be back up
 

303
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,469
uh it's amazon's fault it'll be back up
tomorrow

304
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
tomorrow
 

305
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,150
tomorrow
yeah exactly it's tough but that's

306
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
yeah exactly it's tough but that's
 

307
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,909
yeah exactly it's tough but that's
that's the infrastructure of this

308
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
that's the infrastructure of this
 

309
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,350
that's the infrastructure of this
internet

310
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
internet
 

311
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,830
internet
do you ever sit there some days and i i

312
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
do you ever sit there some days and i i
 

313
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,270
do you ever sit there some days and i i
realize i'm like going off on a tangent

314
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
realize i'm like going off on a tangent
 

315
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,870
realize i'm like going off on a tangent
out and just wondering already

316
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
out and just wondering already
 

317
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,830
out and just wondering already
we're not even a minute but you ever

318
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
we're not even a minute but you ever
 

319
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,590
we're not even a minute but you ever
wonder what's going to be like the next

320
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
wonder what's going to be like the next
 

321
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,309
wonder what's going to be like the next
iteration of the internet the next

322
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
iteration of the internet the next
 

323
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,510
iteration of the internet the next
iteration of the internet

324
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
iteration of the internet
 

325
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,830
iteration of the internet
yeah i think the next iteration as we

326
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
yeah i think the next iteration as we
 

327
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,550
yeah i think the next iteration as we
see the technology progressing as far as

328
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
see the technology progressing as far as
 

329
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,430
see the technology progressing as far as
bandwidth

330
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440

satellite network it's going to hit the
 

499
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,070
satellite network it's going to hit the
globe not tesla but

500
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
globe not tesla but
 

501
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,190

same shenanigans that's right but yeah i
 

509
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,509
same shenanigans that's right but yeah i
think it's going to be wireless and i

510
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
think it's going to be wireless and i
 

511
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,110
think it's going to be wireless and i
think it's going to allow bandwidth to

512
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
think it's going to allow bandwidth to
 

513
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,790
think it's going to allow bandwidth to
go so much faster

514
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
go so much faster
 

515
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,389
go so much faster
it'll be interesting to see how it

516
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
it'll be interesting to see how it
 

517
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,230
it'll be interesting to see how it
progresses over the years and what

518
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
progresses over the years and what
 

519
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,230
progresses over the years and what
changes what's uh what's really kind of

520
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
changes what's uh what's really kind of
 

521
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,949
changes what's uh what's really kind of
catching my my eye is this covid app

522
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
catching my my eye is this covid app
 

523
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,110
catching my my eye is this covid app
that we've got in ontario actually i

524
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
that we've got in ontario actually i
 

525
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,550
that we've got in ontario actually i
think it's across canada

526
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
think it's across canada
 

527
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,550
think it's across canada
for that randomly connects with

528
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
for that randomly connects with
 

529
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,470
for that randomly connects with
bluetooth

530
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
bluetooth
 

531
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,870
bluetooth
so that if you've walked near somebody

532
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
so that if you've walked near somebody
 

533
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,550
so that if you've walked near somebody
that has tested positive for covid you

that has tested positive for covid you
 

535
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,230
that has tested positive for covid you
get an alert that goes

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
get an alert that goes
 

537
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,310
get an alert that goes
hey you don't don't interact with that

538
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
hey you don't don't interact with that
 

539

who's been tested

544
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
who's been tested
 

545
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,630
who's been tested
positive oh wow so this is happening all

546
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
positive oh wow so this is happening all
 

547
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,070
positive oh wow so this is happening all
in the back end on your device and

548
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
in the back end on your device and
 

549
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,509
in the back end on your device and
and so i was thinking about that going

550
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
and so i was thinking about that going
 

551
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,269
and so i was thinking about that going
this is just with bluetooth

552
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
this is just with bluetooth
 

553
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,389
this is just with bluetooth
is there a way to have almost like

554
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
is there a way to have almost like
 

555
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,030
is there a way to have almost like
hot spotting as you go with mobile

556
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
hot spotting as you go with mobile
 

557
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,350
hot spotting as you go with mobile
phones that would allow this

558
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
phones that would allow this
 

559
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,710
phones that would allow this
constant wireless network to be like

560
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
constant wireless network to be like
 

561
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,069
constant wireless network to be like
so interesting i mean a couple of things

562
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
so interesting i mean a couple of things
 

563
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,750
so interesting i mean a couple of things
come to mind jeff would you first

564
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
come to mind jeff would you first
 

565
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,350
come to mind jeff would you first
first of all when you start talking

566
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
first of all when you start talking
 

567
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,790
first of all when you start talking
about wireless i start thinking about

568
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
about wireless i start thinking about
 

569
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,870
about wireless i start thinking about
man that would be so expensive

570
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
man that would be so expensive
 

571
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,470
man that would be so expensive
but the interesting thing is that with

572
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
but the interesting thing is that with
 

573
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,310
but the interesting thing is that with
the progression of technology

574
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
the progression of technology
 

575
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,430
the progression of technology
and the the betterment of the underlying

576
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
and the the betterment of the underlying
 

577
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,230
and the the betterment of the underlying
infrastructure the cost to the end

578
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
infrastructure the cost to the end
 

579
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,750
infrastructure the cost to the end
consumers goes down

580
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
consumers goes down
 

581
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,310
consumers goes down
yeah so we're going to see that price go

582
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
yeah so we're going to see that price go
 

583
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,949
yeah so we're going to see that price go
down so

584
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
down so
 

585
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,870
down so
maybe my my smartphone and the ability

586
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
maybe my my smartphone and the ability
 

587
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,829
maybe my my smartphone and the ability
to connect to

588
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
to connect to
 

589
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,190
to connect to
five 6g internet is going to drop

590
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
five 6g internet is going to drop
 

591
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,030
five 6g internet is going to drop
and when that happens now all of a

592
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
and when that happens now all of a
 

593
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,190
and when that happens now all of a
sudden autonomous vehicles become

594
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
sudden autonomous vehicles become
 

595
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,350
sudden autonomous vehicles become
much more autonomous that's right

596
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
much more autonomous that's right
 

597
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,110
much more autonomous that's right
because they're internet connected

598
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
because they're internet connected
 

599
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,350
because they're internet connected
all the time with a high-speed internet

600
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
all the time with a high-speed internet
 

601
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,870
all the time with a high-speed internet
connection yeah

602
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
connection yeah
 

603
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,949
connection yeah
and and then we've got all these new new

604
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
and and then we've got all these new new
 

605
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,710
and and then we've got all these new new
technologies that can just open up

606
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
technologies that can just open up
 

607
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,710
technologies that can just open up
that's right and things like these apps

608
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
that's right and things like these apps
 

609
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,230
that's right and things like these apps
that that communicate but then

610
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
that that communicate but then
 

611
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,829
that that communicate but then
the second thing that comes to mind is

612
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
the second thing that comes to mind is
 

613
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,670
the second thing that comes to mind is
now you've got everybody calling big

614
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
now you've got everybody calling big
 

615

yes but where is the line where we say

620
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
yes but where is the line where we say
 

621
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,790
yes but where is the line where we say
okay well we want big brother to some

622

okay well we want big brother to some
extent

624
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
extent
 

625
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,829
extent
i want google to be able to tell me if

626
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839

california that's smart
and and so there comes a point where you

634
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
and and so there comes a point where you
 

635
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,949
and and so there comes a point where you
say okay well i'm gonna

636

to my
 

641
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,550
to my
telemetry yeah but then how much trust

642
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
telemetry yeah but then how much trust
 

643
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,470
telemetry yeah but then how much trust
are you putting in this company

644
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
are you putting in this company
 

645
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,350
are you putting in this company
so so there's there's yeah there's there

646
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
so so there's there's yeah there's there
 

647
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,430
so so there's there's yeah there's there
are all these considerations

648
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
are all these considerations
 

649
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,870
are all these considerations
i think in general the human race uh

650
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
i think in general the human race uh
 

651
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,670
i think in general the human race uh
as a broad brushstroke so not everybody

652
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
as a broad brushstroke so not everybody
 

653
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,190
as a broad brushstroke so not everybody
but as a broad brushstroke

654
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
but as a broad brushstroke
 

655
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,630
but as a broad brushstroke
i think we're always going to go with

656
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
i think we're always going to go with
 

657

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,790
most people
again general broad brushstroke most

706
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
again general broad brushstroke most
 

707
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,990
again general broad brushstroke most
people are like you know what

708
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
people are like you know what
 

709
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,990

it's the convenience of it i'll deal

710
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
it's the convenience of it i'll deal
 

711
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,750
it's the convenience of it i'll deal
with it and they just

712
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760

980
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
linux kit that's powered by an arm
 

981
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,230
linux kit that's powered by an arm
processor and i

982
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
processor and i
 

983
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,189
processor and i
wanted to go that route simply because

984
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
wanted to go that route simply because
 

985
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,390
wanted to go that route simply because
i've been drooling over

986
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
i've been drooling over
 

987
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,510
i've been drooling over
those since they came out but for

988
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
those since they came out but for
 

989
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,669
those since they came out but for
what i need to use it for it's just not

990
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
what i need to use it for it's just not
 

991
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,870
what i need to use it for it's just not
powerful enough

992
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
powerful enough
 

993
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,429
powerful enough
um and this is it like so that's why i

994
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
um and this is it like so that's why i
 

995
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,150
um and this is it like so that's why i
use it to

996
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
use it to
 

997
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,630
use it to
remotely connect into my more powerful

998
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
remotely connect into my more powerful
 

999
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,429
remotely connect into my more powerful
devices

1000
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
devices
 

1001
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,150
devices
i don't have a more powerful device so

1002
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
i don't have a more powerful device so
 

1003
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,750
i don't have a more powerful device so
so it's just a change in the paradigm

1004
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
so it's just a change in the paradigm
 

1005
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,350
so it's just a change in the paradigm
it's just shifting the paradigm and

1006
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
it's just shifting the paradigm and
 

1007
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,390
it's just shifting the paradigm and
realizing that

1008
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
realizing that
 

1009
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,669
realizing that
and and then using single board

1010
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
and and then using single board
 

1011
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,830
and and then using single board
computers so i've got raspberry pi's and

1012
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
computers so i've got raspberry pi's and
 

1013
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,549
computers so i've got raspberry pi's and
odroid xu4s i've got lots of those

1014
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
odroid xu4s i've got lots of those
 

1015
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,990
odroid xu4s i've got lots of those
because those are probably my favorite

1016
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
because those are probably my favorite
 

1017
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,390
because those are probably my favorite
board as far as like the universal

1018
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
board as far as like the universal
 

1019
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,909
board as far as like the universal
debian server goes yeah with usb 3 and

1020
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
debian server goes yeah with usb 3 and
 

1021
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,390
debian server goes yeah with usb 3 and
and everything else um and and then

1022
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
and everything else um and and then
 

1023
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,669
and everything else um and and then
accessing them from there

1024
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
accessing them from there
 

1025
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,669
accessing them from there
and and i've got access to as many

1026
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
and and i've got access to as many
 

1027
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,950
and and i've got access to as many
systems as i have

1028
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
systems as i have
 

1029
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,310
systems as i have
i'll tell you what i'll trade in my

1030
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
i'll tell you what i'll trade in my
 

1031
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,909
i'll tell you what i'll trade in my
laptop and i'll get a pine book if you

1032
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
laptop and i'll get a pine book if you
 

1033

it's a win-win but see when my internet

1038
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
it's a win-win but see when my internet
 

1039
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,230
it's a win-win but see when my internet
goes down now i've lost everything yeah

1040
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
goes down now i've lost everything yeah
 

1041
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,549
goes down now i've lost everything yeah
i am i'm a fish out of water i don't

1042
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
i am i'm a fish out of water i don't
 

1043
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,909
i am i'm a fish out of water i don't
know like what do i do

1044
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
know like what do i do
 

1045
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,590
know like what do i do
when i have no internet connectivity

1046
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
when i have no internet connectivity
 

1047
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,909
when i have no internet connectivity
because now from my pine book i can't do

1048
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
because now from my pine book i can't do
 

1049
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,950
because now from my pine book i can't do
anything that's when you go

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,470

good times for me i've been

1056
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
good times for me i've been
 

1057
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,590
good times for me i've been
i've been teaching myself how

1058
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
i've been teaching myself how
 

1059
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,190
i've been teaching myself how
to use a 3d printer and also it's

1060
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
to use a 3d printer and also it's
 

1061
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,150
to use a 3d printer and also it's
arrived

1062
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
arrived
 

1063
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,270
arrived
well no well this is the thing is is

1064
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
well no well this is the thing is is
 

1065
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,390
well no well this is the thing is is
my my experiment

1066
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
my my experiment
 

1067
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,990
my my experiment
is i want to know if i were to

1068
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
is i want to know if i were to
 

1069
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,590
is i want to know if i were to
get a 3d printer is it going to

1070
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
get a 3d printer is it going to
 

1071
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,190
get a 3d printer is it going to
be so onerous for me to learn how to use

1072
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
be so onerous for me to learn how to use
 

1073
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,070
be so onerous for me to learn how to use
it

1074
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
it
 

1075
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,710
it
that it becomes another one of those

1076
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
that it becomes another one of those
 

1077
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,430
that it becomes another one of those
technologies that i purchase and then

1078
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
technologies that i purchase and then
 

1079
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,470
technologies that i purchase and then
never use

1080
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
never use
 

1081
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,310
never use
right because we fall into that that's

1082
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
right because we fall into that that's
 

1083
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,710
right because we fall into that that's
right a cool tech comes out and you want

1084
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
right a cool tech comes out and you want
 

1085
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:02,950
right a cool tech comes out and you want
it

1086
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
it
 

1087
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,110
it
and you buy it and then it's too hard to

1088
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
and you buy it and then it's too hard to
 

1089
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,630
and you buy it and then it's too hard to
learn and you don't have time and it

1090
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
learn and you don't have time and it
 

1091
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,549
learn and you don't have time and it
just sits on a shelf somewhere

1092
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
just sits on a shelf somewhere
 

1093
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,950
just sits on a shelf somewhere
and then it becomes obsolete yes so i've

1094
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
and then it becomes obsolete yes so i've
 

1095
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,630
and then it becomes obsolete yes so i've
taken a different approach and said okay

1096
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
taken a different approach and said okay
 

1097
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,190
taken a different approach and said okay
i'm going to learn how to 3d print first

1098
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
i'm going to learn how to 3d print first
 

1099
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,669
i'm going to learn how to 3d print first
okay and then i'm going to

1100
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
okay and then i'm going to
 

1101
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,350
okay and then i'm going to
make that decision so yes working with

1102
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
make that decision so yes working with
 

1103
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,590
make that decision so yes working with
design very cool so i use a tool

1104
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
design very cool so i use a tool
 

1105
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,710
design very cool so i use a tool
at tinkercad.com which is made by the

1106

cool so what ideas have you come up with

1114
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
cool so what ideas have you come up with
 

1115
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,190
cool so what ideas have you come up with
so my original ideas

1116
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
so my original ideas
 

1117
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,190
so my original ideas
are very very basic jeff as you can

1118

are very very basic jeff as you can
imagine i mean i'm just learning

1120
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
imagine i mean i'm just learning
 

1121
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,909
imagine i mean i'm just learning
the ropes but so so

1122
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
the ropes but so so
 

1123
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,590
the ropes but so so
and i mentioned this two weeks ago when

1124
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
and i mentioned this two weeks ago when
 

1125
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,270
and i mentioned this two weeks ago when
you were here that i was going to do

1126

i wanted a place to hang face masks
 

1133
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,070
i wanted a place to hang face masks
because

1134
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080

1141
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,190
five or more of these i think i've got
like 10 of them myself because i'm

1142
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
like 10 of them myself because i'm
 

1143
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,710
like 10 of them myself because i'm
working in the field and the kids each

1144
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
working in the field and the kids each

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
have five yeah face masks
 

1147
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,750
have five yeah face masks
but we bought the washable ones

1148
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
but we bought the washable ones
 

1149
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,750
but we bought the washable ones
and you don't want to put them through

1150
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
and you don't want to put them through
 

1151
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,950
and you don't want to put them through
the dryer so

1152
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
the dryer so
 

1153
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,070
the dryer so
right i want to make a rack for them so

1154
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
right i want to make a rack for them so
 

1155
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,909
right i want to make a rack for them so
i've designed i haven't printed because

1156
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
i've designed i haven't printed because
 

1157
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,350
i've designed i haven't printed because
i don't have a 3d printer

1158
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
i don't have a 3d printer
 

1159
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,470
i don't have a 3d printer
but this was the experiment can i design

1160
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
but this was the experiment can i design
 

1161
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,870
but this was the experiment can i design
the the idea that comes to mind which is

1162
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
the the idea that comes to mind which is
 

1163
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,669
the the idea that comes to mind which is
a

1164
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
a
 

1165
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,870
a
half inch piece of pvc pipe hanging in

1166
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
half inch piece of pvc pipe hanging in
 

1167
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,549
half inch piece of pvc pipe hanging in
the unfinished laundry room so i've got

1168
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
the unfinished laundry room so i've got
 

1169
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,070
the unfinished laundry room so i've got
access to the rafters i can just screw

1170
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
access to the rafters i can just screw
 

1171
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,190
access to the rafters i can just screw
right into them

1172
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
right into them
 

1173
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,470
right into them
and so i designed the um the mech

1174
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
and so i designed the um the mech
 

1175
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,230
and so i designed the um the mech
well the mechanism the plates to put the

1176
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
well the mechanism the plates to put the
 

1177
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,950
well the mechanism the plates to put the
half inch pvc up on the ceiling okay

1178
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:42,960
half inch pvc up on the ceiling okay
 

1179
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,510
half inch pvc up on the ceiling okay
hanging

1180
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
hanging
 

1181
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,190
hanging
and the hooks that are going to hook

1182
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
and the hooks that are going to hook
 

1183
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,350
and the hooks that are going to hook
onto that to allow us to hang as many

1184
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
onto that to allow us to hang as many
 

1185
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,990
onto that to allow us to hang as many
masks as we

1186
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
masks as we
 

1187
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,549
masks as we
want very cool so it is kind of cool so

1188
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
want very cool so it is kind of cool so
 

1189
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,909
want very cool so it is kind of cool so
it feels like something that

1190
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
it feels like something that
 

1191
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,310
it feels like something that
i hey i'm i'm actually designing i'm

i hey i'm i'm actually designing i'm
 

1193
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,590
i hey i'm i'm actually designing i'm
actually creating

1194
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
actually creating
 

1195
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,669
actually creating
based on a need based on something that

1196
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
based on a need based on something that
 

1197
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,510
based on a need based on something that
i probably couldn't just walk into a

1198
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
i probably couldn't just walk into a
 

1199
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,350
i probably couldn't just walk into a
hardware store and buy

1200
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
hardware store and buy
 

1201
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,230
hardware store and buy
and probably doing it a lot cheaper

1202
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
and probably doing it a lot cheaper
 

1203
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,230
and probably doing it a lot cheaper
there's the cost of a 3d printer

1204
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
there's the cost of a 3d printer
 

1205
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,870
there's the cost of a 3d printer
but as bp9 mentioned in on on the

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
but as bp9 mentioned in on on the
 

1207

the the fact is is that even though

1210
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
the the fact is is that even though
 

1211
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,669
the the fact is is that even though
there's an investment in the 3d printer

1212
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
there's an investment in the 3d printer
 

1213
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,110
there's an investment in the 3d printer
which is pretty cheap these days

1214
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
which is pretty cheap these days

initial hurdle of like the investment
 

1227
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,990
initial hurdle of like the investment
is there but fairly quickly as

1228
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
is there but fairly quickly as
 

1229
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,310
is there but fairly quickly as
you design and print things you're going

1230
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
you design and print things you're going
 

1231
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,270
you design and print things you're going
to make that back

1232
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
to make that back
 

1233
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,350
to make that back
of course that's the idea yeah and that

1234
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
of course that's the idea yeah and that
 

1235
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,430
of course that's the idea yeah and that
makes sense i'm really seeing that as i

1236
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
makes sense i'm really seeing that as i
 

1237
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,510
makes sense i'm really seeing that as i
l as i look at things in online shopping

1238
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
l as i look at things in online shopping
 

1239
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,590
l as i look at things in online shopping
and think could i this is the challenge

1240
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
and think could i this is the challenge
 

1241
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,630
and think could i this is the challenge
that i've given myself

1242
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
that i've given myself
 

1243
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,510
that i've given myself
could i create that myself with a 3d

1244
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
could i create that myself with a 3d
 

1245
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,310
could i create that myself with a 3d
printer

1246
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
printer
 

1247
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,070
printer
and then i start looking at okay well

1248
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
and then i start looking at okay well
 

1249
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,669
and then i start looking at okay well
that thing

1250
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
that thing
 

1251
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,950
that thing
would cost me 20 and i could print it

1252
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
would cost me 20 and i could print it
 

1253
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,470
would cost me 20 and i could print it
for 20 cents

1254
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
for 20 cents
 

1255
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,950
for 20 cents
right so how quickly could i make that

1256
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
right so how quickly could i make that
 

1257
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,830
right so how quickly could i make that
back

1258
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
back
 

1259
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,149
back
it's an interesting experiment but but

it's an interesting experiment but but
 

1261
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,149
it's an interesting experiment but but
i've proven to myself that

i've proven to myself that

why it's critical
 

1457
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,789
why it's critical
critical and uh why it's not actually

1458
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
critical and uh why it's not actually
 

1459
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,149
critical and uh why it's not actually
as complicated as it sounds right

i couldn't grow a beard like that if i

1538
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840
i couldn't grow a beard like that if i
 

1539
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,149
i couldn't grow a beard like that if i
tried

1540
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
tried
 

1541
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,750
tried
when you sign into your online account

1542
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
when you sign into your online account
 

1543
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,430
when you sign into your online account
you've got typically a username and a

1544
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
you've got typically a username and a
 

1545
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,870
you've got typically a username and a
password right

1546
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
password right
 

1547
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,669
password right
so that's basically so that the server

1548
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
so that's basically so that the server
 

1549
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,909
so that's basically so that the server
can tell that it is you that is logging

1550
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
can tell that it is you that is logging
 

1551
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,230
can tell that it is you that is logging
in

1552
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
in
 

1553
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,389
in
right your username is often something

1554
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399
right your username is often something
 

1555
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,269
right your username is often something
that is

1556
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
that is
 

1557
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,870
that is
publicly accessible so that could be

1558
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
publicly accessible so that could be
 

1559
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,389
publicly accessible so that could be
your email address or

1560
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399
your email address or
 

1561
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,630
your email address or
in my case like it could be baldnerd

1562
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:24,640
in my case like it could be baldnerd
 

1563
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,750
in my case like it could be baldnerd
right

1564
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
right
 

1565
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,950
right
so that username is not something that

1566
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
so that username is not something that
 

1567
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,029
so that username is not something that
is a security factor whatsoever of

1568
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
is a security factor whatsoever of
 

1569
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,190
is a security factor whatsoever of
course anyone can get that so

1570
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
course anyone can get that so
 

1571
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,029
course anyone can get that so
um anyone who knows your password

1572
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:37,039
um anyone who knows your password
 

1573
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,669
um anyone who knows your password
can say okay well my username is

1574
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
can say okay well my username is
 

1575
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,669
can say okay well my username is
baldnerd and my password is

1576
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:42,679
baldnerd and my password is
 

1577
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:45,590
baldnerd and my password is
winston2075 right so now they can access

1578
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
winston2075 right so now they can access
 

1579
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,630
winston2075 right so now they can access
your account because

1580
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
your account because
 

1581
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,990
your account because
those are the only factors that you have

1582
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
those are the only factors that you have
 

1583
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,669
those are the only factors that you have
basically just the password right

1584
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:49,679
basically just the password right
 

1585
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,669
basically just the password right
the plot thickens if you've got the same

1586
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
the plot thickens if you've got the same
 

1587
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,669
the plot thickens if you've got the same
password on other services as well which

1588
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
password on other services as well which
 

1589
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,029
password on other services as well which
so many people do

1590
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
so many people do
 

1591
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,110
so many people do
don't do that yeah and that's why we say

1592
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
don't do that yeah and that's why we say
 

1593
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,430
don't do that yeah and that's why we say
do not have the same password on other

1594
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
do not have the same password on other
 

1595
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,710
do not have the same password on other
services because

1596
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
services because
 

1597
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,190
services because
if you get compromised on one you're now

1598
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
if you get compromised on one you're now
 

1599
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,470
if you get compromised on one you're now
compromised on other

1600
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
compromised on other
 

1601

so with the username and password
 

1625
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,549
so with the username and password
combination

1626
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
combination
 

1627
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,950
combination
the server itself so the connecting

1628
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
the server itself so the connecting
 

1629
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,389
the server itself so the connecting
server whether it's like

1630
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
server whether it's like
 

1631
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,029

your online banking or twitter or

1635
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,789
facebook or whatever it is you're
logging

1636
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
logging
 

1637
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,149
logging
into it has no way of actually verifying

1638
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
into it has no way of actually verifying
 

1639
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,630
into it has no way of actually verifying
that the person who's logging in

1640
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
that the person who's logging in
 

1641
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,909
that the person who's logging in
is in fact you right

1642
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
is in fact you right
 

1643
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,470
is in fact you right
they know the username and password and

1644
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
they know the username and password and
 

1645
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,269
they know the username and password and
so they're

1646
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
so they're
 

1647
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,149
so they're
given access right so two-factor

1648
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
given access right so two-factor
 

1649
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,029
given access right so two-factor
authentication

1650
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039
authentication
 

1651
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,549
authentication
sometimes called multi-factor

1652
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
sometimes called multi-factor
 

1653
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,549
sometimes called multi-factor
authentication uh it can be

1654
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
authentication uh it can be
 

1655
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,630
authentication uh it can be
intimidating it can sound kind of

1656
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
intimidating it can sound kind of
 

1657
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,590
intimidating it can sound kind of
complicated but

1658
00:28:59,590 --> 00:28:59,600
complicated but
 

1659
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,750
complicated but
really it's just a way for the online

1660
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
really it's just a way for the online
 

1661
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,110
really it's just a way for the online
server to recognize

1662
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
server to recognize
 

1663
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,470
server to recognize
that when uh when someone is logging in

1664
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
that when uh when someone is logging in
 

1665
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,750
that when uh when someone is logging in
as you that it is in fact

1666
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
as you that it is in fact
 

1667
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,789
as you that it is in fact
you you right um so the server is able

1668
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
you you right um so the server is able
 

1669
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,830
you you right um so the server is able
to say

1670
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
to say
 

1671
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,950
to say
yeah that's the right password but i

1672
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
yeah that's the right password but i
 

1673
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,230
yeah that's the right password but i
know robbie and you're not him right

1674
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240
know robbie and you're not him right
 

1675
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,350
know robbie and you're not him right
okay so then how do we do that and

1676
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
okay so then how do we do that and
 

1677
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,350
okay so then how do we do that and
really it comes down to that the easiest

1678
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
really it comes down to that the easiest
 

1679
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,470
really it comes down to that the easiest
way

1680
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
way
 

1681
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,830
way
is something like this something you

1682
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
is something like this something you
 

1683
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,389
is something like this something you
already own

1684
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
already own
 

1685
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,230
already own

complaint about me
 

1701
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,990
complaint about me
is that it's literally on me all the

is that it's literally on me all the
 

1703
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,510
is that it's literally on me all the
time but that's convenient when it comes

1704
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:49,520
time but that's convenient when it comes
 

1705
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,149
time but that's convenient when it comes
to this

1706
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,159
to this
 

1707
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,710
to this
absolutely it is because even though

1708
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
absolutely it is because even though
 

1709
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,470
absolutely it is because even though
somebody might be able to obtain your

and your email because that's not really
 

1715
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,269

impossible
 

1717
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,990
impossible
it's a lot harder and less likely that

1718
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
it's a lot harder and less likely that
 

1719
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,909
it's a lot harder and less likely that
they're going to have physical access

1720
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
they're going to have physical access
 

1721
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,070
they're going to have physical access
to your phone so with two-factor

1722
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080
once you enter your password uh and your
 

1727
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,669
once you enter your password uh and your
login for the account

you'll be uh prompted to obtain and
enter a code from your phone it could

1732
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
enter a code from your phone it could
 

1733
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,750
enter a code from your phone it could
come in through text or

1734
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
come in through text or
 

1735
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,149
come in through text or
you know maybe through an app whatever

1736
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159
you know maybe through an app whatever
 

1737
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,230
you know maybe through an app whatever
but you know your phone becomes that

1738
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,240
but you know your phone becomes that
 

1739
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,630
but you know your phone becomes that
second factor in the authentication

1740
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
second factor in the authentication
 

1741
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,590
second factor in the authentication
process

1742
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
process
 

1743
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,870
process
which makes it two-factor authentication

1744
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
which makes it two-factor authentication
 

1745
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,710
which makes it two-factor authentication
so it's not really as complicated as it

1746
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
so it's not really as complicated as it
 

1747
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,710
so it's not really as complicated as it

to do the math was there yeah it was
 

2597
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,390
to do the math was there yeah it was
there we've butchered it so far but

2598
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,400
there we've butchered it so far but
 

2599
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,550
there we've butchered it so far but
that's right but significantly cheaper

00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:56,560
that's right but significantly cheaper
 

2601
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,309
that's right but significantly cheaper
significant make this upgrade

it's 0.8 kilometers from
the junction box at the corner to where

the junction box at the corner to where
our property line was and every quote we

2644
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:39,839
our property line was and every quote we
 

2645
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:40,870

2649
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,109
six figures or more yeah and i'm like
we're talking a kilometer

2650
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
we're talking a kilometer
 

2651
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,309
we're talking a kilometer
and then i'm hearing this and i'm like

2652
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:46,319
and then i'm hearing this and i'm like
 

2653
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,069
and then i'm hearing this and i'm like
this is amazing but at the same time the

2654
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
this is amazing but at the same time the
 

2655
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,349
this is amazing but at the same time the
fact that it's utilizing

2656
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:49,359
fact that it's utilizing
 

2657
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,430
fact that it's utilizing
light and i mean here we are in a studio

2658
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
light and i mean here we are in a studio
 

2659
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,670
light and i mean here we are in a studio
with light bulbs all around us now

2660
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
with light bulbs all around us now
 

2661
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,950
with light bulbs all around us now
they're all led

2662
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:56,960
they're all led
 

2663
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,030
they're all led
so that's not quite the same thing but

2664
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
so that's not quite the same thing but
 

2665
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,870
so that's not quite the same thing but
how neat would it be

2666
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:00,880
how neat would it be
 

2667
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,230
how neat would it be
if this technology could be advanced to

2668
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,240
if this technology could be advanced to
 

2669
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,349
if this technology could be advanced to
the point where we're getting our

2670
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359
the point where we're getting our
 

2671
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,510
the point where we're getting our
internet off a light bulb

2672
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:07,520
internet off a light bulb
 

2673
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,550
internet off a light bulb
if it's if it's through like how neat

2674
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:10,560
if it's if it's through like how neat
 

2675
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,349
if it's if it's through like how neat
would that be

2676
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:11,359
would that be
 

2677
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,430
would that be
like it's gotta be a little more refined

2678
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
like it's gotta be a little more refined
 

2679
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,390
like it's gotta be a little more refined
than that i mean

2680
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
than that i mean
 

2681
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,190
than that i mean
fiber optics are i i agree but you look

2682
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
fiber optics are i i agree but you look
 

2683
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,510
fiber optics are i i agree but you look
at where the internet was 25 years ago

2684
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,520
at where the internet was 25 years ago
 

2685
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,829
at where the internet was 25 years ago
yeah like imagine 15 years from now you

per second uh 20 up 45 down yeah okay
so that's not bad that's pretty good no

2704
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
so that's not bad that's pretty good no
 

2705

so that's not bad that's pretty good no
we could stream that's good expensive

2706
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
we could stream that's good expensive
 

2707
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,309
we could stream that's good expensive
yeah wouldn't it be cheaper this is just

2708
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
yeah wouldn't it be cheaper this is just
 

2709
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,150
yeah wouldn't it be cheaper this is just

yeah
um and and figuring out kind of the

3436
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:24,400
um and and figuring out kind of the
 

3437
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,910
um and and figuring out kind of the
technology and how everything

3438
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
technology and how everything
 

3439
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,349
technology and how everything
is going to work and i think you're

3440
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
is going to work and i think you're
 

3441
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,950
is going to work and i think you're
going to find that this week things are

3442
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
going to find that this week things are
 

3443
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,589
going to find that this week things are
looking

3444
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:29,599
looking
 

3445
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,270
looking
better than ever certainly they're

3446
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:31,280
better than ever certainly they're
 

3447
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,870
better than ever certainly they're
sounding better than ever and

3448
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
sounding better than ever and
 

3449
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,390
sounding better than ever and
that is largely to do with ameridroid's

3450
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:36,400
that is largely to do with ameridroid's
 

3451
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,470
that is largely to do with ameridroid's
easy portal having been installed in the

3452
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,480
easy portal having been installed in the
 

3453
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,069
easy portal having been installed in the
studio now we're able to get

3454
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
studio now we're able to get
 

3455
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,069
studio now we're able to get
the cables between the studio and the

3456
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
the cables between the studio and the
 

3457
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,789
the cables between the studio and the
bridge and so our audio receivers for

3458
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:44,799
bridge and so our audio receivers for
 

3459
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,069
bridge and so our audio receivers for
our microphones are now

3460
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
our microphones are now
 

3461
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,309
our microphones are now
here in the studio with us rather than

3462
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:48,319
here in the studio with us rather than
 

3463
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,270
here in the studio with us rather than
going through

3464
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,280
going through
 

3465
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,030
going through
a steel studded wall which was causing

3466
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,040
a steel studded wall which was causing
 

3467
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,789
a steel studded wall which was causing
some interference and some dropouts here

3468
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
some interference and some dropouts here
 

3469
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:53,510
some interference and some dropouts here
and there

3470
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520
and there
 

3471
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,950
and there
occasionally throughout the show so

3472
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
occasionally throughout the show so
 

3473
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,630
occasionally throughout the show so
that's why things are sounding a lot

3474
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:56,640
that's why things are sounding a lot
 

3475
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,030
that's why things are sounding a lot
better

3476
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,040
better
 

3477
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,430
better
as far as looking a lot better we're

3478
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,440
as far as looking a lot better we're
 

3479
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,069
as far as looking a lot better we're
doing uh well our lighting is now

3480
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
doing uh well our lighting is now
 

3481
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,829
doing uh well our lighting is now
almost set up so we're about fifty

3482
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:03,839
almost set up so we're about fifty
 

3483
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:05,270
almost set up so we're about fifty
percent there um

3484
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,280
percent there um
 

3485
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,150
percent there um
so what we are seeing now is a lot

3486
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
so what we are seeing now is a lot
 

3487
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,430
so what we are seeing now is a lot
different than what you've seen in the

3488
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:09,440
different than what you've seen in the
 

3489
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,430
different than what you've seen in the
past those of you who support us

3490
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
past those of you who support us

know kind of

3494
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
know kind of
 

3495
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,549
know kind of
how things are looking here in the

3496
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:16,559
how things are looking here in the
 

3497
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,109
how things are looking here in the
studio but beyond the camera

3498
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:19,119
studio but beyond the camera
 

3499
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,430
studio but beyond the camera
we're seeing lights mount well you can

3500
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:21,440
we're seeing lights mount well you can
 

3501
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,270
we're seeing lights mount well you can
see all the shadows yeah

3502
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:23,280
see all the shadows yeah
 

3503
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,030
see all the shadows yeah
notice how many shadows there are of my

3504
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
notice how many shadows there are of my
 

3505
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,870
notice how many shadows there are of my
arm so there are lights everywhere

3506
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
arm so there are lights everywhere
 

3507
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,950
arm so there are lights everywhere
and we do have some some soft boxes

3508
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:28,960
and we do have some some soft boxes
 

3509
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,470
and we do have some some soft boxes
mounted on the ceiling and and so

3510
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,480
mounted on the ceiling and and so
 

3511
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,589
mounted on the ceiling and and so
lighting in here is

3512
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:31,599
lighting in here is
 

3513
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,190
lighting in here is
significantly better five six seven

3514
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,200
significantly better five six seven
 

3515
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,950
significantly better five six seven
seven lights and then that weird

3516
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
seven lights and then that weird
 

3517
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,789
seven lights and then that weird
u-shaped thing

3518
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:38,799
u-shaped thing
 

3519
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,710
u-shaped thing
the weird u-shape oh with that thing

3520
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
the weird u-shape oh with that thing
 

3521
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,549
the weird u-shape oh with that thing
yeah

3522
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:42,559
yeah
 

3523
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,270
yeah
and it's actually got an led uh point

3524
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
and it's actually got an led uh point
 

3525
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,870
and it's actually got an led uh point
down on it that's actually reflecting

3526
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:46,880
down on it that's actually reflecting
 

3527
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,190
down on it that's actually reflecting
back

3528
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:47,200
back
 

3529
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,030
back
to us so that's what's giving us that

3530
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:49,040
to us so that's what's giving us that
 

3531
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,470
to us so that's what's giving us that
there was a natural light

3532
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:50,480
there was a natural light
 

3533
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,549
there was a natural light
and we've been able to turn off the

3534
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
and we've been able to turn off the
 

3535
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:53,589
and we've been able to turn off the
fluorescent lighting

3536
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:53,599
fluorescent lighting
 

3537
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,589
fluorescent lighting
here yes which is that's a big

3538
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:55,599
here yes which is that's a big
 

3539
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,630
here yes which is that's a big
difference here so

3540
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,640

when you think about um lighting uh a
production studio

3544
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
production studio
 

3545
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,270
production studio
um having like sunlight balanced

3546
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,280
um having like sunlight balanced
 

3547
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,150
um having like sunlight balanced
white clean light is very very important

3548
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,160
white clean light is very very important
 

3549
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:06,950
white clean light is very very important
yes um so

3550
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
yes um so
 

3551
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,390
yes um so
when we first moved in here of course

3552
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:08,400
when we first moved in here of course
 

3553
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,990
when we first moved in here of course
we're using the the built-in

3554
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
we're using the the built-in
 

3555
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,430
we're using the the built-in
lighting which is like 3500 kelvin so

3556
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,440
lighting which is like 3500 kelvin so
 

3557
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,990
lighting which is like 3500 kelvin so
it's like really really poor lighting

3558
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,000
it's like really really poor lighting
 

3559
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,190
it's like really really poor lighting
for video yeah

3560
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,200
for video yeah
 

3561
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,589
for video yeah
um and now we're starting to starting to

3562
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:19,599
um and now we're starting to starting to
 

3563
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:20,870
um and now we're starting to starting to
be a little bit better so

3564
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,880
be a little bit better so
 

3565
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,750
be a little bit better so
so where are we at with that um really i

3566
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
so where are we at with that um really i
 

3567
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:23,990
so where are we at with that um really i
mean

3568
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
mean
 

3569
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,349
mean
jeff is looking around and saying oh

01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
jeff is looking around and saying oh
 

3571
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:26,470
jeff is looking around and saying oh
well why haven't you turned on that

3572
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,480
well why haven't you turned on that
 

3573
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,589
well why haven't you turned on that
light why haven't you turned on that

3574
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:27,599
light why haven't you turned on that
 

3575
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:27,990
light why haven't you turned on that
light

3576
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:28,000
light
 

3577
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,589
light
and that's because the ones that are

3578
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
and that's because the ones that are
 

3579
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,750
and that's because the ones that are
mounted um that are going to be dmx

3580
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:31,760
mounted um that are going to be dmx
 

3581
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,390
mounted um that are going to be dmx
controlled

3582
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,400
controlled
 

3583
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,710
controlled
haven't yet been wired in and that's

3584
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
haven't yet been wired in and that's
 

3585
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,630
haven't yet been wired in and that's
because we're still waiting on hardware

3586
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,640
because we're still waiting on hardware
 

3587
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,670
because we're still waiting on hardware
they're still um mount um electrical

3588
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
they're still um mount um electrical
 

3589
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,190
they're still um mount um electrical
hardware that has to come in right

3590
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:41,200
hardware that has to come in right
 

3591
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,030
hardware that has to come in right
because things take a while to arrive

3592
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,040
because things take a while to arrive
 

3593
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,549
because things take a while to arrive

that has an overhead camera that we can

3602
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:52,640
that has an overhead camera that we can
 

3603
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,150
that has an overhead camera that we can
move around

3604
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
move around
 

3605
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,990
