1022
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
yes you should definitely be part of
 

1023
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,990
yes you should definitely be part of
this year

1024
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
this year
 

1025
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,029
this year
now um where is this coming from

1026
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
now um where is this coming from
 

1027
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,110
now um where is this coming from
and if we look at this website here you

1028
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
and if we look at this website here you
 

1029
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,949
and if we look at this website here you
can see that if you would provide ample

1030
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
can see that if you would provide ample
 

1031
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,710
can see that if you would provide ample
eth as liquidity

1032
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
eth as liquidity
 

1033
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,470
eth as liquidity
you would get over a thousand percent

1034
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
you would get over a thousand percent
 

1035
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,070
you would get over a thousand percent
apr and that sounds like magic right

1036
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
apr and that sounds like magic right
 

1037
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,909
apr and that sounds like magic right
it doesn't sound very real especially if

1038
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
it doesn't sound very real especially if
 

1039
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,510
it doesn't sound very real especially if
you would put money in your

1040
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
you would put money in your
 

1041
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,230
you would put money in your
uh normal account in your traditional

1042
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
uh normal account in your traditional
 

1043
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,870
uh normal account in your traditional
bank

1044
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
bank
 

1045
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,310
bank
you would probably get 0.5 apr

1046
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
you would probably get 0.5 apr
 

1047
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,350
you would probably get 0.5 apr
so why is this number so big and what

1048
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
so why is this number so big and what
 

1049
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,430
so why is this number so big and what
i'm going to do now is i'm going to go

1050
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
i'm going to do now is i'm going to go
 

1051
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,350
i'm going to do now is i'm going to go
into the detail of where this number is

1052
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
into the detail of where this number is
 

1053
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,630
into the detail of where this number is
coming from

1054
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
coming from
 

1055
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,669
coming from
and i'm not going to be going too much

1056
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
and i'm not going to be going too much
 

1057
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,430
and i'm not going to be going too much
into too much detail

1058
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
into too much detail
 

1059
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,990
into too much detail
so i'm simplifying a lot but you will

1060
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
so i'm simplifying a lot but you will
 

1061
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,350
so i'm simplifying a lot but you will
get the idea

1062
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
get the idea
 

1063
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,510
get the idea
the first part is if we look at the

1064
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
the first part is if we look at the
 

1065
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,870
the first part is if we look at the
rates

1066
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
rates
 

1067
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,669
rates
of where the market is in the in the

1068
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
of where the market is in the in the
 

1069
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,870
of where the market is in the in the
crypto market

1070
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
crypto market
 

1071
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,310
crypto market
it's not that much different from the

1072
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
it's not that much different from the
 

1073
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,350
it's not that much different from the
traditional bank so usdc

1074
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
traditional bank so usdc
 

1075
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,390
traditional bank so usdc
if i would provide usdc's to to

1076
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
if i would provide usdc's to to
 

1077
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,190
if i would provide usdc's to to
uh for example aver i would get 2.1

1078
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
uh for example aver i would get 2.1
 

1079
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,630
uh for example aver i would get 2.1
percent

1080
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
percent
 

1081
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,270
percent
interest if i would borrow at other

1082
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
interest if i would borrow at other
 

1083
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,549
interest if i would borrow at other
usdc then i would got 4.4

1084
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
usdc then i would got 4.4
 

1085
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,470
usdc then i would got 4.4
so far so good right so that's no

1086
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
so far so good right so that's no
 

1087
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,710
so far so good right so that's no
different so that's part one part two

1088
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
different so that's part one part two
 

1089
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,430
different so that's part one part two
is if i would provide liquidity and for

1090
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
is if i would provide liquidity and for
 

1091
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,070
is if i would provide liquidity and for
that we go to something called uniswap

1092
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
that we go to something called uniswap
 

1093
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,590
that we go to something called uniswap
and uniswap is where you can exchange

1094
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
and uniswap is where you can exchange
 

1095
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,390
and uniswap is where you can exchange
tokens so if you've got eth and you want

1096
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
tokens so if you've got eth and you want
 

1097
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,510
tokens so if you've got eth and you want
to buy

1098
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
to buy
 

1099
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,110
to buy
let's say band then as you can see down

1100
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
let's say band then as you can see down
 

1101
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,510
let's say band then as you can see down
here

1102
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
here
 

1103
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,909
here
you would have to provide a liquidity

1104
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
you would have to provide a liquidity
 

1105
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,430
you would have to provide a liquidity
provider you would receive you would

1106
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
provider you would receive you would
 

1107
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,669
provider you would receive you would
have to pay a liquidity provider fee

1108
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
have to pay a liquidity provider fee
 

1109
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,430
have to pay a liquidity provider fee
and this this year and if you would

1110
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
and this this year and if you would
 

1111
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,270
and this this year and if you would
provide money into this pool so if you

1112
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
provide money into this pool so if you
 

1113
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,430
provide money into this pool so if you
in other words you provide eth and band

1114
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
in other words you provide eth and band
 

1115
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,310
in other words you provide eth and band
so that other people can participate in

1116
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
so that other people can participate in
 

1117
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,110
so that other people can participate in
this year

1118
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
this year
 

1119
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,870
this year
then you would get part of this fee

1120
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
then you would get part of this fee
 

1121
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,590
then you would get part of this fee
most part even yeah so it's very simple

1122
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
most part even yeah so it's very simple
 

1123
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,789
most part even yeah so it's very simple
you click on pool

1124
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
you click on pool
 

1125
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,430
you click on pool
you click on add liquidity you say what

1126
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
you click on add liquidity you say what
 

1127
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,630
you click on add liquidity you say what
is it going to be

1128
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
is it going to be
 

1129

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,470
that's it that's all you have to do
so that's how you provide liquidity

1134
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480

and the third one that i forgot to

1228
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
and the third one that i forgot to
 

1229
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,029
and the third one that i forgot to
mention before is staking rewards

1230
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
mention before is staking rewards
 

1231

mention before is staking rewards
so if i i would take for example tesla's

1232
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
so if i i would take for example tesla's
 

1233
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,430
so if i i would take for example tesla's
to secure the network um

1234
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
to secure the network um
 

1235
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,669
to secure the network um
by proof of stake then tesla's would

1236
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
by proof of stake then tesla's would
 

1237
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,070
by proof of stake then tesla's would
give me in this case through coinbase

1238
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
give me in this case through coinbase
 

1239
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,070
give me in this case through coinbase
five percent staking fee yeah that's

1240
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
five percent staking fee yeah that's

by keeping my money my tesla's in a
wallet and not using it

1246

wallet and not using it
 

1247
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,990
wallet and not using it
i would receive five percent so there

1248
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
i would receive five percent so there
 

1249
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,909
i would receive five percent so there
are a few incentives that are compared

1250
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
are a few incentives that are compared
 

1251
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,950
are a few incentives that are compared
to the traditional market equivalent and

1252
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
to the traditional market equivalent and
 

1253
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,390
to the traditional market equivalent and
not that much different

1254
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400

because here you can see which platform

1306
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
because here you can see which platform
 

1307
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,070
because here you can see which platform
is really safe and which one isn't safe

1308

so if i take arva for example

1310
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
so if i take arva for example
 

1311
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,390
so if i take arva for example
uh which is one of the big ones then

1312
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
uh which is one of the big ones then
 

1313
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,710
uh which is one of the big ones then
they have got a score of 84 percent

1314

they have got a score of 84 percent
 

1315
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,870
they have got a score of 84 percent
and why it's because execute code

1316
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
and why it's because execute code
 

1317
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,390
and why it's because execute code

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,280
you've got an auditor to
 

1329
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,830
you've got an auditor to
review books so they do that here with

1330
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
review books so they do that here with
 

1331
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,630
review books so they do that here with
the code so

1332
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
the code so
 

1333
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,390
the code so
it's a third party that reviews your

1334
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
it's a third party that reviews your
 

1335
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,149
it's a third party that reviews your
code how good it is

1336
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
code how good it is
 

1337
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,830
code how good it is
so this is pretty good but on the other

1338
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
so this is pretty good but on the other
 

1339
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,990
so this is pretty good but on the other
end you've got something like based

1340
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
end you've got something like based
 

1341
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,549
end you've got something like based
that print in principle did not do

1342
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
that print in principle did not do
 

1343
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,590
that print in principle did not do
anything really

1344
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
anything really
 

1345
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,149
anything really
i mean they just put the code online and

1346
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
i mean they just put the code online and
 

1347
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,830
i mean they just put the code online and
didn't even test it

1348
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
didn't even test it
 

1349
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,230
didn't even test it
beforehand it's nothing is documented

1350
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
beforehand it's nothing is documented
 

1351
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,230
beforehand it's nothing is documented
and an audit was done only to 20

1352

1353
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,230
and an audit was done only to 20
so this is something that i would really

1354
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
so this is something that i would really
 

1355
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,510
so this is something that i would really
be careful of
