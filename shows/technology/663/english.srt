before the correction but it's
 

2297
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,190
before the correction but it's
recovering nicely and as you can see

2298
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
recovering nicely and as you can see
 

2299
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,790
recovering nicely and as you can see
we see a lot of green in

00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:22,800
we see a lot of green in
 

2301
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,270
we see a lot of green in
in the market cap but if we start after

2302
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
in the market cap but if we start after
 

2303
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,230

our seven days

2304
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240
our seven days
 

2305
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,230
our seven days
we see the usual picture d5 d5 d5 d5

2306
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
we see the usual picture d5 d5 d5 d5
 

2307
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,349
we see the usual picture d5 d5 d5 d5
and so on and so on and if we sorted by

2308
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
and so on and so on and if we sorted by
 

2309
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,630
and so on and so on and if we sorted by
the negative

2310
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:34,640
the negative
 

2311
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,990
the negative
it's similar also d5 d5 d5

2312
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000
it's similar also d5 d5 d5
 

2313
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,589
it's similar also d5 d5 d5
and so we get a lot of questions in

2314
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:39,599
and so we get a lot of questions in
 

2315
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,589
and so we get a lot of questions in

why an apr of 889

2342
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,200
why an apr of 889
 

2343
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,870
why an apr of 889
is possible and if you click on this

2344
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:16,880
is possible and if you click on this
 

2345
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,910
is possible and if you click on this
uh option here then you see that the

2346
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
uh option here then you see that the
 

2347
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,870
uh option here then you see that the
smart contract

2348
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
smart contract
 

2349
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,190
smart contract
risk level is high and the impermanent

2350
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,200
risk level is high and the impermanent
 

2351
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,270
risk level is high and the impermanent
loss level is high

2352
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
loss level is high
 

2353
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,430
loss level is high
and so i explained to you that smart

2354
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:27,440
and so i explained to you that smart
 

2355
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,150
and so i explained to you that smart
contract that's something that you can

2356
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:30,160
contract that's something that you can

that will explain to you which protocol

2360
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
that will explain to you which protocol
 

2361
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,510
that will explain to you which protocol
is safe and which one isn't

2362
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:37,520
is safe and which one isn't
 

2363
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,589
is safe and which one isn't
so if it's something in red i would

2364
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:39,599
so if it's something in red i would
 

2365
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,190
so if it's something in red i would
definitely not touch that

2366
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,200
definitely not touch that
 

2367
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,109
definitely not touch that
if it's green then yes it has been

2368
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:43,119
if it's green then yes it has been
 

2369
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,309
if it's green then yes it has been
audited and it's

2370
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
audited and it's
 

2371
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,069
audited and it's
probably safe the other thing is the

2372
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
probably safe the other thing is the
 

2373
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,069
probably safe the other thing is the
impermanent loss and to explain

2374
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079
impermanent loss and to explain
 

2375
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,390
impermanent loss and to explain
how that one works because everybody has

2376
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
how that one works because everybody has
 

2377
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,309
how that one works because everybody has
got a question what is impermanent loss

2378
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:54,319
got a question what is impermanent loss
 

2379
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,150
got a question what is impermanent loss
just those two words are really weird

2380
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
just those two words are really weird
 

2381
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,630
just those two words are really weird
anyway so if we look at the traditional

2382
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:58,640
anyway so if we look at the traditional
 

2383
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,829
anyway so if we look at the traditional
market

2384
00:43:59,829 --> 00:43:59,839
market
 

2385
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,230
market
yeah like here i pulled up binance uh

2386
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
yeah like here i pulled up binance uh
 

2387
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,270
yeah like here i pulled up binance uh
with exam

2388
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
with exam
 

2389
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,550
with exam
and bdc then you see here

2390
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:06,560
and bdc then you see here
 

2391
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,230
and bdc then you see here
that you've got the order book people

2392
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
that you've got the order book people
 

2393
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,030
that you've got the order book people
want to sell and people that want to buy

2394
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
want to sell and people that want to buy
 

2395
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,589
want to sell and people that want to buy
and in the middle somewhere they find

2396
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
and in the middle somewhere they find
 

2397
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,670
and in the middle somewhere they find
the mutual prices acceptable

2398
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
the mutual prices acceptable
 

2399
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,670
the mutual prices acceptable
but you've got people that have got

2400
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:17,680
but you've got people that have got
 

2401
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,270
but you've got people that have got
different price views and they're just

2402
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:19,280
different price views and they're just
 

2403
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,510
different price views and they're just
willing to wait or not wait

2404
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,520
willing to wait or not wait
 

2405
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,630
willing to wait or not wait
and that's not the case in protocols

2406
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
and that's not the case in protocols
 

2407
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,030
and that's not the case in protocols
like uniswap

2408
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,040
like uniswap
 

2409
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,870
like uniswap
as you probably saw in uni swap you

2410
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
as you probably saw in uni swap you
 

2411
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,950
as you probably saw in uni swap you
don't have an order book

2412
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:30,960
don't have an order book
 

2413
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,950
don't have an order book
and the way that that's set up is

2414
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
and the way that that's set up is
 

2415
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,349
and the way that that's set up is
explained through this chart here

2416
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:35,359
explained through this chart here
 

2417
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,750
explained through this chart here
so at the beginning when you build up a

2418
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
so at the beginning when you build up a
 

2419
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,109
so at the beginning when you build up a
pool in uniswap

2420
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
pool in uniswap
 

2421
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,349
pool in uniswap
you decide how many ethereum in this

2422
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:41,359
you decide how many ethereum in this
 

2423
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,109
you decide how many ethereum in this
case how many die you're putting into

2424
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
case how many die you're putting into
 

2425
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,390
case how many die you're putting into
the pool

2426
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
the pool
 

2427
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,990
the pool
and that's the ratio that's fixed and so

2428
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,000
and that's the ratio that's fixed and so
 

2429
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,309
and that's the ratio that's fixed and so
of course the prices are changing and if

2430
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
of course the prices are changing and if
 

2431
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,069
of course the prices are changing and if
the prices are changing a little bit

2432
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
the prices are changing a little bit
 

2433
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,910
the prices are changing a little bit
it's no problem but if the prices are

2434
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:53,920
it's no problem but if the prices are
 

2435
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,109
it's no problem but if the prices are
changing a lot

2436
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,119
changing a lot
 

2437
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,550
changing a lot
it is a problem and that's called

2438
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:56,560
it is a problem and that's called
 

2439
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,470
it is a problem and that's called
impermanent loss

2440
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
impermanent loss
 

2441
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,670
impermanent loss
and what i've done here for you is um

2442
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
and what i've done here for you is um
 

2443
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,390
and what i've done here for you is um
i set up a calculation as an excel

2444
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,400
i set up a calculation as an excel
 

2445
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,430
i set up a calculation as an excel
spreadsheet

2446
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
spreadsheet
 

2447
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,790
spreadsheet
so you can see here for example when we

2448
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:08,800
so you can see here for example when we
 

2449
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,870
so you can see here for example when we
have got a protocol ethereum and sushi

2450
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:12,880
have got a protocol ethereum and sushi
 

2451
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,030
have got a protocol ethereum and sushi
i also a pool we provide liquidity for

2452
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,040
i also a pool we provide liquidity for
 

2453
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,670
i also a pool we provide liquidity for
pool ethereum and sushi the price

2454
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
pool ethereum and sushi the price
 

2455
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,790
pool ethereum and sushi the price
when we opened that pool is 386 and the

2456
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:20,800
when we opened that pool is 386 and the
 

2457
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,430
when we opened that pool is 386 and the
sushi price is 504

2458
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:23,440
sushi price is 504
 

2459
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,550
sushi price is 504
and today the price went down a little

2460
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:26,560
and today the price went down a little
 

2461
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:26,870
and today the price went down a little
bit

2462
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
bit
 

2463
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,150
bit
in ethereum it's now 375.65

2464
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
in ethereum it's now 375.65
 

2465
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,630
in ethereum it's now 375.65
and sushi are left here at 504 so the

2466
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:32,640
and sushi are left here at 504 so the
 

2467
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,309
and sushi are left here at 504 so the
impairment loss is about zero percent in

2468
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
impairment loss is about zero percent in
 

2469
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,030
impairment loss is about zero percent in
other words

2470
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
other words
 

2471
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,630
other words
you have not lost any of your money but

2472
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,640
you have not lost any of your money but
 

2473
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,750
you have not lost any of your money but
if this price changes significantly then

2474
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
if this price changes significantly then
 

2475
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,630
if this price changes significantly then
at the moment

2476
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
at the moment
 

2477
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,750
at the moment
it's are it's around three dollars then

2478
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:45,760
it's are it's around three dollars then
 

2479
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,069
it's are it's around three dollars then
there is an impermanent loss of 2.9 so

2480
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
there is an impermanent loss of 2.9 so
 

2481
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,589
there is an impermanent loss of 2.9 so
you lost 2.9

2482
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:49,599
you lost 2.9
 

2483
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,030
you lost 2.9
of your assets in this in this case

2484
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
of your assets in this in this case
 

2485
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,349
of your assets in this in this case
if we make that difference bigger so

2486
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
if we make that difference bigger so
 

2487
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,150
if we make that difference bigger so
let's say

2488
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
let's say
 

2489
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,349
let's say
say that this is not three this is

2490
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:02,359

 

2491
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,390

0.4

2492
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
0.4
 

2493
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,430
0.4
then you see you lost 47.2 percent it's

2494
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
then you see you lost 47.2 percent it's
 

2495
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,309
then you see you lost 47.2 percent it's
not

2496
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
not
 

2497
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,270
not
that you lost the sushi part of your

2498
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,280
that you lost the sushi part of your
 

2499
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,109
that you lost the sushi part of your
portfolio because remember

2500
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:13,119
portfolio because remember
 

2501
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,750
portfolio because remember
there's always this balance you lost

2502
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760
there's always this balance you lost
 

2503
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,589
there's always this balance you lost
47 of your whole pool so the good

2504
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
47 of your whole pool so the good
 

2505
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,589
47 of your whole pool so the good
money that in this case is theorem that

2506
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:23,599
money that in this case is theorem that
 

2507
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:24,790
money that in this case is theorem that
stayed stable

2508
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800
stayed stable
 

2509
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,190
stayed stable
you lost 47 of that one too and that's

2510
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
you lost 47 of that one too and that's
 

2511
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,589
you lost 47 of that one too and that's
the risk that you're carrying here

2512
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:29,599
the risk that you're carrying here
 

2513
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,430
the risk that you're carrying here
and that's a problem with all these d5

2514
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
and that's a problem with all these d5
 

2515
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,950
and that's a problem with all these d5
protocols like here

2516
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
protocols like here
 

2517
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,030
protocols like here
moon which is another similar to sushi

2518
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
moon which is another similar to sushi
 

2519
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,950
moon which is another similar to sushi
you have got an apy

2520
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:36,960
you have got an apy
 

2521
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,470
you have got an apy
of three thousand percent sounds

2522
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
of three thousand percent sounds
 

2523
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,510
of three thousand percent sounds
fantastic but have you checked the

2524
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
fantastic but have you checked the
 

2525
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,630
fantastic but have you checked the
the moon price now so let's do that we

2526
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
the moon price now so let's do that we
 

2527
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,309
the moon price now so let's do that we
if we go into here and say moon

2528
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
if we go into here and say moon
 

2529
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,750
if we go into here and say moon
then you'll see the risk that you're

2530
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
then you'll see the risk that you're
 

2531
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,630
then you'll see the risk that you're
carrying by just investing in this pool

2532
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
carrying by just investing in this pool
 

2533
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,150
carrying by just investing in this pool
yeah so let's go 14 days so at one stage

2534
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,160
yeah so let's go 14 days so at one stage
 

2535
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,349
yeah so let's go 14 days so at one stage
it was 12 and now

2536
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:57,359
it was 12 and now
 

2537
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,230
it was 12 and now
it's around 2.90 so you will have lost

2538
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
it's around 2.90 so you will have lost
 

2539
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,230
it's around 2.90 so you will have lost
significantly amount whether it's go up

2540
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
significantly amount whether it's go up
 

2541
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,670
significantly amount whether it's go up
or down doesn't matter it's always the

2542
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:03,680
or down doesn't matter it's always the
 

2543
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,950
or down doesn't matter it's always the
relationship

2544
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
relationship
 

2545
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,030
relationship
the relation that is important so you

2546
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:07,040
the relation that is important so you
 

2547
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,790
the relation that is important so you
will have lost a lot of money by

2548
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:08,800
will have lost a lot of money by
 

2549
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,150
will have lost a lot of money by
investing in this pool

2550
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
investing in this pool
 

2551
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,750
investing in this pool
and that's exactly the risk that you're

2552
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
and that's exactly the risk that you're
 

2553
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,309
and that's exactly the risk that you're
carrying which is called

2554
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
carrying which is called
 

2555
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,950
carrying which is called
impermanent loss yeah so that's where

2556
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
impermanent loss yeah so that's where
 

2557
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,390
impermanent loss yeah so that's where
you have to be really careful

2558
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
you have to be really careful
 

2559
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,150
you have to be really careful
you have to check if you invest in one

2560
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,160
you have to check if you invest in one
 

2561
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,230
you have to check if you invest in one
of those crazy pools

2562
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:22,240
of those crazy pools
 

2563
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,230
of those crazy pools
you have to be really on top of that and

2564
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:24,240
you have to be really on top of that and
 

2565
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,670
you have to be really on top of that and
check it every hour

2566
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:25,680
check it every hour
 

2567
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,750
check it every hour
even during the night that the price

2568
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:27,760
even during the night that the price
 

2569
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,349
even during the night that the price
doesn't change because you know

2570
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
doesn't change because you know
 

2571
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,750
doesn't change because you know
in cryptos those prices can change in a

2572
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:31,760
in cryptos those prices can change in a
 

2573
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,109
in cryptos those prices can change in a
second

2574
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
second
 

2575
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,589
second
so i hope you understood what um

2576
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:35,599
so i hope you understood what um
 

2577
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,430
so i hope you understood what um
impermanent loss is

2578
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,440
impermanent loss is
 

2579
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,510
impermanent loss is
and how risky that is if you invest in

2580
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:39,520
and how risky that is if you invest in
 

2581
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,349
and how risky that is if you invest in
these coins and they all are risky so

2582
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:41,359
these coins and they all are risky so
 

2583
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,549
these coins and they all are risky so
there is not one

2584
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:42,559
there is not one
 

2585
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,270
there is not one
where you can say um that this is a safe

2586
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:45,280
where you can say um that this is a safe

okay so here we've got a base it's just

3082
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
okay so here we've got a base it's just
 

3083
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,750
okay so here we've got a base it's just
a black base i have seen some pictures

3084
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:43,760
a black base i have seen some pictures
 

3085
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,069
a black base i have seen some pictures
on

3086
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
on
 

3087
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,789
on
twitter uh with a glass base and i

3088
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
twitter uh with a glass base and i
 

3089
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,390
twitter uh with a glass base and i
really really love

3090
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:48,400
really really love
 

3091
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,470
really really love
that idea but i haven't been able to

3092
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
that idea but i haven't been able to
 

3093
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,990
that idea but i haven't been able to
find it so i think that that might have

3094
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:52,000
find it so i think that that might have
 

3095
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,750
find it so i think that that might have
been like a custom base that was

3096
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
been like a custom base that was
 

3097
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,589
been like a custom base that was
like for maybe for tom or something like

3098
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
like for maybe for tom or something like
 

3099
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,190
like for maybe for tom or something like
that so that just kind of

3100
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:57,200
that so that just kind of
 

3101
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,990
that so that just kind of
snaps together presumably and into the

3102
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
snaps together presumably and into the
 

3103
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,630
snaps together presumably and into the
box

3104
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:04,640

 

3105
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,349

it's cold the metal because it's a

3106
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:07,359
it's cold the metal because it's a
 

3107
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,030
it's cold the metal because it's a
die-cast model

3108
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,040
die-cast model
 

3109
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,789
die-cast model
the metal is actually you can feel that

3110
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:10,799
the metal is actually you can feel that
 

3111
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,549
the metal is actually you can feel that
it is a metal model

3112
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:12,559
it is a metal model
 

3113
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,789
it is a metal model
that's cool it's got metal parts now i

3114
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:14,799
that's cool it's got metal parts now i
 

3115
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,349
that's cool it's got metal parts now i
can feel these are plastic

3116
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
can feel these are plastic
 

3117
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,710
can feel these are plastic
i want to call them the cells we're

3118
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
i want to call them the cells we're
 

3119
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,950
i want to call them the cells we're
going to call them engine loops

3120
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960
going to call them engine loops
 

3121
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,270
going to call them engine loops
the lower two are plastic and the top

3122
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
the lower two are plastic and the top
 

3123
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,030
the lower two are plastic and the top
one is metal part of the die cast so

3124
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,040
one is metal part of the die cast so
 

3125
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,230
one is metal part of the die cast so
this is

3126
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
this is
 

3127
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,870
this is
the cast model here and then the

3128
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:28,880
the cast model here and then the
 

3129
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,390
the cast model here and then the
attachments are

3130
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,400
attachments are
 

3131
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,069
attachments are
the lower two engine loops

3132
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:34,079
the lower two engine loops
 

3133
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,270
the lower two engine loops
and there you are

3134
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:40,280
