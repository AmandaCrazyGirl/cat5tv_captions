1337
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,110
take a quick peek at that that's a
really simple revision though i would

1338
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,120
really simple revision though i would
 

1339
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,230
really simple revision though i would
expect

1340
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
expect
 

1341
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,470
expect
dragging one note down as long as he's

1342
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
dragging one note down as long as he's
 

1343
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,909
dragging one note down as long as he's
not actually playing this out

1344
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
not actually playing this out
 

1345
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,750
not actually playing this out
on a keyboard and having to redo entire

1346
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
on a keyboard and having to redo entire
 

1347
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,909
on a keyboard and having to redo entire
bits but it seems to me like that's

1348
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:43,919
bits but it seems to me like that's
 

1349
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,870
bits but it seems to me like that's
probably something that he can just pull

1350
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:46,880
probably something that he can just pull
 

1351
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,630
probably something that he can just pull
together in the sequencer if he's

1352
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,640
together in the sequencer if he's

sequencing

next year and most economists are

2468
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:37,520
next year and most economists are
 

2469
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,710
next year and most economists are
warning that that's

2470
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:38,720
warning that that's
 

2471
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,990
warning that that's
a very bad sign for the economy

2472

2473
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,270
a very bad sign for the economy
and at the same time i would like to

2474
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:45,280
and at the same time i would like to
 

2475
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:45,990
and at the same time i would like to
show you

show you
something out of our industry which is

2478
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
something out of our industry which is
 

2479
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,750
something out of our industry which is
saying that crypto banks are going to

2480
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:49,760
saying that crypto banks are going to
 

2481
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,309
saying that crypto banks are going to
swallow fiat banks in three or even

2482
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:52,319
swallow fiat banks in three or even
 

2483
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,589
swallow fiat banks in three or even
less years and why is that case

2484
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
less years and why is that case
 

2485
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,670
less years and why is that case
because crypto banks can compete on a

2486
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:57,680
because crypto banks can compete on a
 

2487
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,750
because crypto banks can compete on a
complete different level they have offer

2488
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
complete different level they have offer
 

2489
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,829
complete different level they have offer
by far bigger products than a

2490
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
by far bigger products than a
 

2491
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,109
by far bigger products than a
traditional bank can do

2492
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:03,119
traditional bank can do
 

2493
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,510
traditional bank can do
because everything is being reinvented

2494
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:05,520
because everything is being reinvented
 

2495
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,030
because everything is being reinvented
as you saw

2496
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,040
as you saw
 

2497
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,589
as you saw
in the last few presentations that i did

2498
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,599
in the last few presentations that i did
 

2499
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,430
in the last few presentations that i did
and also the cost i mean they don't have

2500
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
and also the cost i mean they don't have
 

2501
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,549
and also the cost i mean they don't have
any buildings and

2502
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:12,559
any buildings and
 

2503
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,230
any buildings and
no employees it's all software that's

2504
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
no employees it's all software that's
 

2505
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,230
no employees it's all software that's
doing this year so the

2506
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
doing this year so the
 

2507
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,910
doing this year so the
traditional banks have got absolute

2508
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:17,920
traditional banks have got absolute
 

2509
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,470
traditional banks have got absolute
chance against our crypto banks

2510
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:20,480
chance against our crypto banks
 

2511
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,670
chance against our crypto banks
and so that's going to be a very

2512
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:21,680
and so that's going to be a very
 

2513
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,150
and so that's going to be a very
interesting development which is great

2514
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,160
interesting development which is great
 

2515
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,510
interesting development which is great
because it gives you

2516
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
because it gives you
 

2517
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,870
because it gives you
as the user a lot of independency

2518
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
as the user a lot of independency
 

2519
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,349
as the user a lot of independency
in an area which is desperately needed

2520
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:31,359
in an area which is desperately needed
 

2521
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,870
in an area which is desperately needed
and this one can see

2522
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:32,880
and this one can see
 

2523
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,870
and this one can see
the increase in users and and value

2524
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:36,880
the increase in users and and value
 

2525
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,069
the increase in users and and value
of money that has been locked into 35 is

2526
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:40,079
of money that has been locked into 35 is
 

2527
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,589
of money that has been locked into 35 is
increasing steadily

2528
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
increasing steadily
 

2529
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,750
increasing steadily
even at this moment of time where we had

2530
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
even at this moment of time where we had
 

2531
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,109
even at this moment of time where we had
some down

2532
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
some down
 

2533
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,670
some down

thing i'd like to show you

2536
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:48,960
thing i'd like to show you
 

2537
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,950
thing i'd like to show you
is so-called non-fungible tokens

2538
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
is so-called non-fungible tokens
 

2539
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,030
is so-called non-fungible tokens
non-fungible tokens

2540
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
non-fungible tokens
 

2541
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,549
non-fungible tokens
are assets that have different prices

2542
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
are assets that have different prices
 

2543
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,870
are assets that have different prices
and good example is artwork

2544
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:58,880
and good example is artwork
 

2545
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,670
and good example is artwork
if you buy picasso and then every

2546
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,680
if you buy picasso and then every
 

2547
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,190
if you buy picasso and then every
picasso has got different price

2548

picasso has got different price
 

2549
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,950
picasso has got different price
depending on provenance

2550
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
depending on provenance
 

2551
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,230
depending on provenance
and and then many factors and uh

2552
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:08,240
and and then many factors and uh
 

2553
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,549
and and then many factors and uh
these things are coming up now in our

2554
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
these things are coming up now in our
 

2555
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:11,349
these things are coming up now in our
world too

2556
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:11,359
world too
 

2557
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,670
world too
and as you can see here there is

2558
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:13,680
and as you can see here there is

somebody that's uh trevor jones that
created this piece here it's digital so

2562
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,440
created this piece here it's digital so
 

2563

that will
grow bigger and bigger it's got the huge

grow bigger and bigger it's got the huge
advantage that with these things you

2586
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:42,319
advantage that with these things you
 

2587
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,950
advantage that with these things you
don't need a certificate of authenticity

2588

don't need a certificate of authenticity
 

2589
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,750
don't need a certificate of authenticity
or you don't need any provenance because

2590
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
or you don't need any provenance because
 

2591
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,630
or you don't need any provenance because
that's all

2592

that's all
 

2593
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,030
that's all
part of the blockchain so you don't need

2594
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
part of the blockchain so you don't need
 

2595
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,710
part of the blockchain so you don't need
to have that separately

2596
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
to have that separately
 

2597
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,470
to have that separately
you know where that painting is coming

2598

and i've got here an example called
 

2605
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,230
and i've got here an example called
decentraland which is a virtual world

2606
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
decentraland which is a virtual world
 

2607

with streets
 

2609
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,109
with streets
and then you've got districts like the

2610
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
and then you've got districts like the
 

2611
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,309
and then you've got districts like the
financial district or the

this case the property
and you don't have a real link between

and you don't have a real link between
 

2697
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,069
and you don't have a real link between
the digital property and the physical

the digital property and the physical
 

2699
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,829

a building onto the blockchain so the
law has to change in order for these

2704

law has to change in order for these
 

2705
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,630
law has to change in order for these
assets to be really

fact that they've
they've had shortage of supply because
