with that too
 

59
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,670
with that too
as we learn a little bit about how

60
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
as we learn a little bit about how

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,590
as we learn a little bit about how
amazon web services ec2

62
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
amazon web services ec2
 

63
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,510
amazon web services ec2
and cloud services and the ability to

64
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
and cloud services and the ability to
 

65
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,270
and cloud services and the ability to
deploy debian servers

66
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
deploy debian servers
 

67
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,750
deploy debian servers
in the cloud infrastructure as we learn

68
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
in the cloud infrastructure as we learn
 

69
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,109
in the cloud infrastructure as we learn
how to do that

70
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
how to do that
 

71
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,789
how to do that
and how that works just know that one of

72
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
and how that works just know that one of
 

73
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,910
and how that works just know that one of
the things that we're going to be doing

74
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
the things that we're going to be doing
 

75
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,149
the things that we're going to be doing
is

76
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
is
 

77
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,390
is
migrating some of our data into that

78
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
migrating some of our data into that
 

79
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,990
migrating some of our data into that
infrastructure as well so i say that

80
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
infrastructure as well so i say that
 

81
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,789
infrastructure as well so i say that
because

82
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
because
 

83
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,950
because
some of our live stream viewers have

84
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
some of our live stream viewers have
 

85
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,550
some of our live stream viewers have
experienced trouble with buffering and

86
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
experienced trouble with buffering and
 

87
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,590
experienced trouble with buffering and
things like that

88
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
things like that
 

89
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,429
things like that
and it's because we have a little single

90
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
and it's because we have a little single
 

91
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,789
and it's because we have a little single
board computer

92
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
board computer
 

93
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,950
board computer
of all things that is that we're

94
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
of all things that is that we're
 

95
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,870
of all things that is that we're
streaming to and then it rebroadcasts to

96
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
streaming to and then it rebroadcasts to
 

97
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,950

other hls players and things like that
it has nimble streamer running on the

102
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
it has nimble streamer running on the
 

103
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,389
it has nimble streamer running on the
single board computer really it's

104
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
single board computer really it's
 

105
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,910
single board computer really it's
amazing wow

106
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
amazing wow
 

107
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,749
amazing wow
however what i did monitor through my

108
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
however what i did monitor through my
 

109
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,950
however what i did monitor through my
testing is that

110
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
testing is that
 

111
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,950
testing is that
it runs up a pretty high cpu when people

112
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
it runs up a pretty high cpu when people
 

113
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,550
it runs up a pretty high cpu when people
are watching right so

114
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
are watching right so
 

115
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,429
are watching right so
that i believe may be what causes some

116
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
that i believe may be what causes some
 

117
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,350
that i believe may be what causes some
buffering issues with our stream

118
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
buffering issues with our stream
 

119
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,630
buffering issues with our stream
um so there's a lot of stuff that goes

120
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
um so there's a lot of stuff that goes
 

121
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,709
um so there's a lot of stuff that goes
on behind the scenes here to try to

122
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
on behind the scenes here to try to
 

123

gonna we're gonna create our own
 

339
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,749
gonna we're gonna create our own
free proxy service that's easier to say

340
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
free proxy service that's easier to say
 

341
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,590

we have the control stick around we'll
 

345
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,840
we have the control stick around we'll
be right back

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,270
i might set up a free proxy service
of my own and you can replicate that and

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,630
and then do a quick search for ec2
and that will take you into basically

492
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
and that will take you into basically
 

493
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,630
and that will take you into basically
their virtualization platform think of

494
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
their virtualization platform think of
 

495
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,670
their virtualization platform think of
ec2 as

496
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
ec2 as
 

497
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,630
ec2 as
just that so the first thing i note when

498
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
just that so the first thing i note when
 

499
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,509
just that so the first thing i note when
i'm here

500
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
i'm here
 

501
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,949
i'm here
in ec2 is my region and this is

502
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
in ec2 is my region and this is
 

503
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,190
in ec2 is my region and this is
important because this is where my proxy

504
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
important because this is where my proxy
 

505
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,190
important because this is where my proxy
server is going to reside

506
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
server is going to reside
 

507
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,070
server is going to reside
should i set it there why is that

508
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
should i set it there why is that
 

509
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,509
should i set it there why is that
important well think about this

510
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
important well think about this
 

511
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,509
important well think about this
let's say i'm using a video streaming

512
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
let's say i'm using a video streaming
 

513
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,710
let's say i'm using a video streaming
service that

514
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
service that
 

515
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,670
service that
restricts canadian access to their video

516
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
restricts canadian access to their video
 

517
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,190
restricts canadian access to their video
streaming service so

518
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
streaming service so
 

519
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,430
streaming service so
by placing my proxy server down in north

520
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440

california
 

523
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,350
california
now all of a sudden they are basically

524
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
now all of a sudden they are basically
 

525
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,110
now all of a sudden they are basically
by ip address going to think that i'm

526
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
by ip address going to think that i'm
 

527
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,310
by ip address going to think that i'm
connecting from

528
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
connecting from
 

529
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,790
connecting from
california so i'm able to work around

530
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
california so i'm able to work around
 

531
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,350
california so i'm able to work around
that

532
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
that
 

533
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,269
that

can even put a server in africa

540
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
can even put a server in africa
 

541
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,870
can even put a server in africa
or asia look at that you can put one

542
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
or asia look at that you can put one
 

543
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,470
or asia look at that you can put one
right in hong kong

544
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
right in hong kong
 

545
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,590
right in hong kong
you can put one in canada a uh in europe

546
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
you can put one in canada a uh in europe
 

547
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,150
you can put one in canada a uh in europe
you've got

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
you've got
 

549
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,190
you've got
all over the place and then we've got

550
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
all over the place and then we've got
 

551
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,670
all over the place and then we've got
middle east and south america right now

when i said instance i'm talking about a

610
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
when i said instance i'm talking about a
 

611
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,230
when i said instance i'm talking about a
virtual machine

612
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
virtual machine
 

613
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,870
virtual machine
so that is literally a virtual machine

614
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
so that is literally a virtual machine
 

615
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,150
so that is literally a virtual machine
so i'm going to deploy one of these

616
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
so i'm going to deploy one of these
 

617
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,630
so i'm going to deploy one of these
operating systems to an instance of ec2

618
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
operating systems to an instance of ec2
 

619
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,350
operating systems to an instance of ec2
which is

620
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
which is
 

621
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,350
which is
a virtual machine so what do i want it

622
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
a virtual machine so what do i want it
 

623
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,870
a virtual machine so what do i want it
to be

624
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
to be
 

625
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,670

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,790
community ones well no you don't because
those ones are going to cost you money

656
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
those ones are going to cost you money
 

657
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,630
those ones are going to cost you money
and you say well but community is free

658
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
and you say well but community is free
 

659
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,310
and you say well but community is free
it's open source and yes

660
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
it's open source and yes
 

661
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,509
it's open source and yes
however it's not a part of the aws

662
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
however it's not a part of the aws
 

663
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,949
however it's not a part of the aws
marketplace and so you're going to have

664
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
marketplace and so you're going to have
 

665
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,710
marketplace and so you're going to have
to pay for the usage

666
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
to pay for the usage
 

667
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,310
to pay for the usage
to have that virtual machine that

668
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
to have that virtual machine that
 

669
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,310
to have that virtual machine that
instance running

670
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320

671
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,150

in the cloud so instead we're going to
 

673
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,350
in the cloud so instead we're going to
use one of the official ones from the

674
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
use one of the official ones from the
 

675
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,430
use one of the official ones from the
aws marketplace let's see what results

676
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
aws marketplace let's see what results
 

677
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,509
aws marketplace let's see what results
we get they're sorted pretty well

678
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
we get they're sorted pretty well
 

679
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,350
we get they're sorted pretty well
debian comes up the first result is

if we want the free tier we've got to go
 

701
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,470
if we want the free tier we've got to go
with a t2 micro

702
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
with a t2 micro
 

703
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,829
with a t2 micro
so i'm going to select that but what

704
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
so i'm going to select that but what
 

705
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,870
so i'm going to select that but what
does it give us it gives us one cpu

706
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
does it give us it gives us one cpu
 

707
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,389
does it give us it gives us one cpu
one gigabyte of memory um

708
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
one gigabyte of memory um
 

709
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,310
one gigabyte of memory um
and then we've got storage to deal with

710
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
and then we've got storage to deal with
 

711
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,590
and then we've got storage to deal with
we don't need a lot of storage because

712
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
we don't need a lot of storage because
 

713
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,910
we don't need a lot of storage because
we're just setting up a basic proxy

714
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
we're just setting up a basic proxy
 

715
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,910
we're just setting up a basic proxy
and that's about it so i'm going to

716
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
and that's about it so i'm going to
 

717
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,350
and that's about it so i'm going to
deploy just as

718
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
deploy just as
 

719
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,069
deploy just as
that so t2 micro is the one that's free

720
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
that so t2 micro is the one that's free

for it
 

729
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,710
for it
right away i'm going to review and

730
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
right away i'm going to review and
 

731
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,069
right away i'm going to review and
launch we're going to come back to

732
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
launch we're going to come back to
 

733
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,790
launch we're going to come back to
do settings like our security groups and

734
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
do settings like our security groups and
 

735
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,829
do settings like our security groups and
things like that i'm just going to leave

736
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
things like that i'm just going to leave
 

737
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,470
things like that i'm just going to leave
everything

738
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
everything
 

739
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,470
everything
by default for now and we're going to

740
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
by default for now and we're going to
 

741
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,590
by default for now and we're going to
launch that so

742
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
launch that so
 

743
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,990
launch that so
first of all i need to create a new key

744
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
first of all i need to create a new key
 

745
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,269
first of all i need to create a new key
pair so this is

746
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
pair so this is
 

747
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,350
pair so this is
the ssh key that i'm going to use in

748
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
the ssh key that i'm going to use in
 

749
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,430
the ssh key that i'm going to use in
order to ssh into

750
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
order to ssh into
 

751
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,670
order to ssh into
this server so i'm going to call this

752
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
this server so i'm going to call this
 

753
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,509
this server so i'm going to call this
one proxy

754
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
one proxy
 

755
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,150
one proxy
server and then download my key pair

756
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
server and then download my key pair
 

757
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,829
server and then download my key pair
make sure you save that somewhere safe

758
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
make sure you save that somewhere safe
 

759
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,310
make sure you save that somewhere safe
i'm going to

760
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
i'm going to
 

761
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,670
i'm going to
throw that onto my server and drop that

762
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
throw that onto my server and drop that
 

763
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,790
throw that onto my server and drop that
there

764
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
there
 

765
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,910
there
and now launch instance means power

766
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
and now launch instance means power
 

767
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,230
and now launch instance means power
on your virtual machine so i'm going to

768
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
on your virtual machine so i'm going to
 

769
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,389
on your virtual machine so i'm going to
push that

770
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
push that
 

771
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,990
push that
and there we go so it's basically

772
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
and there we go so it's basically
 

773
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,470
and there we go so it's basically
creating it is creating a virtual

774
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
creating it is creating a virtual
 

775
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,110
creating it is creating a virtual
machine

776
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
machine
 

777
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,310
machine
uh an ec2 instance in the cloud for us

778
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
uh an ec2 instance in the cloud for us
 

779
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,350
uh an ec2 instance in the cloud for us
in uh in northern california so there we

780
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
in uh in northern california so there we
 

781
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,670
in uh in northern california so there we
go

782
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
go
 

783
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,269
go
so i'm going to view instances down here

784
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
so i'm going to view instances down here
 

785
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,110
so i'm going to view instances down here
and now i can see i now have one

786
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
and now i can see i now have one
 

787
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,190
and now i can see i now have one
instance running a t2 micro

788
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
instance running a t2 micro
 

789
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,829
instance running a t2 micro
and it is just no name so i'm going to

790
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
and it is just no name so i'm going to
 

791
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,189
and it is just no name so i'm going to
click on edit and i'm going to call this

792
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
click on edit and i'm going to call this
 

793
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,790
click on edit and i'm going to call this
my proxy server

794
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
my proxy server
 

795
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,829
my proxy server
server try that there we go okay so it's

796
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
server try that there we go okay so it's
 

797
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,430
server try that there we go okay so it's
already up and running

798
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
already up and running
 

799
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,509
already up and running
so if i click on that i can see the ip

800
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
so if i click on that i can see the ip
 

801
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,670
so if i click on that i can see the ip
address of that server it is i've called

802
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
address of that server it is i've called
 

803
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,350
address of that server it is i've called
it proxy server but right now

804
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
it proxy server but right now
 

805
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,110
it proxy server but right now
remember it's just debian 10. there's

806
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
remember it's just debian 10. there's
 

807
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,710
remember it's just debian 10. there's
nothing else installed on it

808
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
nothing else installed on it
 

809
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,829
nothing else installed on it
so i need to copy that ip address

810
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
so i need to copy that ip address
 

811
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,470
so i need to copy that ip address
and then i'm going to jump into my

812
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
and then i'm going to jump into my
 

813
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,030
and then i'm going to jump into my
command

814
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
command
 

815

00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
almost done the final thing that we need
 

1031
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,789
almost done the final thing that we need
to do is we just need to tell aws

1032
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
to do is we just need to tell aws
 

1033
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,990
to do is we just need to tell aws
the ec2 security that

the ec2 security that
we're going to set up a policy that says

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
so that's what we're going to do right
 

1047
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,310
so that's what we're going to do right
now so i'm going to jump back here and

1048
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,320
now so i'm going to jump back here and
 

1049
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,789
now so i'm going to jump back here and
you see this server up on the screen

1050
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
you see this server up on the screen
 

1051
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,990
you see this server up on the screen
well if i click on security i can then

1052
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
well if i click on security i can then
 

1053
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,830
well if i click on security i can then
click on the security group that it is

1054
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
click on the security group that it is
 

1055
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,669
click on the security group that it is
assigned automatically so just click

1056
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
assigned automatically so just click
 

1057
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,230
assigned automatically so just click
that

1058
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
that
 

1059
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,390
that
and now it has left me over to ec2

1060
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
and now it has left me over to ec2
 

1061
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,470
and now it has left me over to ec2
security groups and the correct security

1062
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
security groups and the correct security

you'll notice that it's already set up

1066
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
you'll notice that it's already set up
 

1067
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,150
you'll notice that it's already set up
one for ssh because

1068
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
one for ssh because
 

1069
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,950
one for ssh because
it's by default enabled i can set that

1070
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
it's by default enabled i can set that
 

1071
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,549
it's by default enabled i can set that
to only allow me as well which is

1072
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
to only allow me as well which is
 

1073
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,430
to only allow me as well which is
important so

1074
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
important so
 

1075
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,430
important so
let's do that just to be in good

1076
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
let's do that just to be in good
 

1077
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,710
let's do that just to be in good
security practices so

1078
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
security practices so
 

1079
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,750
security practices so
ssh i'm going to change it from

1080
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:04,760

i'm going to close x that and then

1084
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
i'm going to close x that and then
 

1085
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,070
i'm going to close x that and then
change it to my ip

1086
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
change it to my ip
 

1087
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,029
change it to my ip
then i'm going to add a new rule you saw

1088
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
then i'm going to add a new rule you saw
 

1089
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,470
then i'm going to add a new rule you saw
how i got here right i know i'm moving

1090
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
how i got here right i know i'm moving
 

1091
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,590
how i got here right i know i'm moving
really really fast

1092
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
really really fast
 

1093
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,070
really really fast
i've just clicked on edit inbound rules

1094
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
i've just clicked on edit inbound rules
 

1095
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,789
i've just clicked on edit inbound rules
over here

1096
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
over here
 

1097
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,950
over here
okay so add a new rule custom tcp is the

1098
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
okay so add a new rule custom tcp is the
 

1099
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,669
okay so add a new rule custom tcp is the
default

1100
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
default
 

1101
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,110
default
port number do you remember 888 and only

1102
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
port number do you remember 888 and only
 

1103
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,549
port number do you remember 888 and only
allow my ip

1104
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
allow my ip
 

1105
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,909
allow my ip
i can call it something if i want proxy

1106
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
i can call it something if i want proxy
 

1107
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,029
i can call it something if i want proxy
and then save my rules

1108
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
and then save my rules
 

1109
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,909
and then save my rules
there we go so now you see ssh and

1110
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:37,919
there we go so now you see ssh and
 

1111
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,430
there we go so now you see ssh and
custom tcp

1112
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
custom tcp
 

1113
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,150
custom tcp
one called proxy on port 888.

1114
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
one called proxy on port 888.
 

1115
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,830
one called proxy on port 888.
so how do we test this okay so our

1116
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
so how do we test this okay so our
 

1117
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,590
so how do we test this okay so our
current ip address is 99.233

1118
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
current ip address is 99.233
 

1119
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,070
current ip address is 99.233
and so i'm going to connect to the proxy

1120
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
and so i'm going to connect to the proxy
 

1121
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,630
and so i'm going to connect to the proxy
this is

how can i make this my own and so
 

1331
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,029
how can i make this my own and so
you know i mentioned at the top of the

1332
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
you know i mentioned at the top of the
 

1333
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,110
you know i mentioned at the top of the
show that our son has

1334
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
show that our son has
 

1335
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,230
show that our son has
gotten into soldering and he's done very

1336
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,240
gotten into soldering and he's done very
 

1337
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,230
gotten into soldering and he's done very
well at it and remind us how old is he

1338
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
well at it and remind us how old is he
 

1339
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,909
well at it and remind us how old is he
just turning 12. just turned 12. all

very well with it and uh he's soldered
 

1345
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,750
very well with it and uh he's soldered
two calculators so far

1346
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
two calculators so far
 

1347
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,990
two calculators so far
um and one of them he's taken to school

1348
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
um and one of them he's taken to school
 

1349
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,909
um and one of them he's taken to school
which his teacher was completely blown

1350
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
which his teacher was completely blown
 

1351
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,549
which his teacher was completely blown
away by

1352
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
away by
 

1353
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,990
away by
yeah i'm thinking 12 years old and he's

1354
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
yeah i'm thinking 12 years old and he's
 

1355
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,830
yeah i'm thinking 12 years old and he's
already making a calculator yeah yeah he

1356
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
already making a calculator yeah yeah he
 

1357
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,310
already making a calculator yeah yeah he
made a calculator we got a diy kit from

1358
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
made a calculator we got a diy kit from
 

1359
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,950
made a calculator we got a diy kit from
amazon and he built it and it maybe two

1360
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960
amazon and he built it and it maybe two
 

1361
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,350
amazon and he built it and it maybe two
hours

1362
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
hours
 

1363
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,510
hours
of work it was really phenomenal unreal

of work it was really phenomenal unreal
 

1365
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,029
of work it was really phenomenal unreal
and his soldering job is

1366
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
and his soldering job is
 

1367
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,669
and his soldering job is
really really clean excellent like looks

1368
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
really really clean excellent like looks

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
but anyway he's been asking how to do
 

1373
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,549
but anyway he's been asking how to do
other stuff and as we're soldering he's

1374
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
other stuff and as we're soldering he's
 

1375
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,590
other stuff and as we're soldering he's
like well what's this

1376
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
like well what's this
 

1377
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,190
like well what's this
and what's this and how's that work and

1378
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
and what's this and how's that work and
 

1379
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,590
and what's this and how's that work and
i'm going i want to be able to teach him

1385
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,470
i want to be able to explain to him how
a circuit board actually works not just

1386
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
a circuit board actually works not just
 

1387
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,990
a circuit board actually works not just
soldering it but understanding the

1388
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,000
soldering it but understanding the
 

1389
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,350
soldering it but understanding the
components and the routing and all that

1390
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
components and the routing and all that
 

1391
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,230
components and the routing and all that
kind of stuff

1392
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
kind of stuff
 

1393
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,269
kind of stuff
and i mean i know you can buy um

1394
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
and i mean i know you can buy um
 

1395
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,789
and i mean i know you can buy um
just plain boards that are just

1396
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
just plain boards that are just
 

1397
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,390
just plain boards that are just
rows of of of little connection points

1398
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
rows of of of little connection points
 

1399
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,750
rows of of of little connection points
but i want to be able to make our own

1400
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
but i want to be able to make our own
 

1401
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,830
but i want to be able to make our own
board yeah and so he's asked

1402
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
board yeah and so he's asked
 

1403
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,630
board yeah and so he's asked
specifically if we can find a diy kit

1404
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
specifically if we can find a diy kit
 

1405
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,269
specifically if we can find a diy kit
for

1406
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
for
 

1407
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,950
for
a useless box you know that's the box

1408
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
a useless box you know that's the box
 

1409

where you push the button yeah and the
little thing comes out and pops it

1412
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
little thing comes out and pops it
 

1413
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,590
little thing comes out and pops it
yeah give it a try

1414

1425
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,789
hey hey now so i've been looking for one
haven't found one but i found a bunch of

1426
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
haven't found one but i found a bunch of
 

1427
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,230
haven't found one but i found a bunch of
people like oh you can make one using an

1428
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
people like oh you can make one using an
 

1429
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,070
people like oh you can make one using an
arduino you can make one using this

1430
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
arduino you can make one using this
 

1431
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,310
arduino you can make one using this
and i was like if i'm gonna do a diy

1432
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,320
and i was like if i'm gonna do a diy
 

1433
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,510
and i was like if i'm gonna do a diy
box useless box i want to build it from

1434
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,520
box useless box i want to build it from
 

1435
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,390
box useless box i want to build it from
the ground

1436
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
the ground
 

1437
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,549
the ground
up so i've been researching how to make

1438
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
up so i've been researching how to make
 

1439
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,149
up so i've been researching how to make
my own pcbs at home

1440
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
my own pcbs at home
 

1441
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,669
my own pcbs at home
okay it's actually not that difficult

1442
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
okay it's actually not that difficult
 

1443
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,310
okay it's actually not that difficult
and i was blown away that all i need is

1444
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
and i was blown away that all i need is
 

1445
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,950
and i was blown away that all i need is
a laser printer to set my routing

1446
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
a laser printer to set my routing
 

1447
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,590
a laser printer to set my routing
like where the paths go so you're going

1448
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
like where the paths go so you're going
 

1449
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,870
like where the paths go so you're going
to actually etch it

1450
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
to actually etch it
 

1451
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,269
to actually etch it
i'm going to actually etch it at home oh

1452
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
i'm going to actually etch it at home oh
 

1453
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:15,909
i'm going to actually etch it at home oh
man

1454
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
man
 

1455
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,390
man
that's way beyond me jeff it's really

1456
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,400
that's way beyond me jeff it's really
 

1457
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,149
that's way beyond me jeff it's really
that involves chemicals

1458
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
that involves chemicals
 

1459
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,870
that involves chemicals
it does but but a really simple process

1460
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
it does but but a really simple process
 

1461
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,669
it does but but a really simple process
so i've found

1462
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
so i've found
 

1463
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,029
so i've found
i've done a bunch of research into it

1464
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
i've done a bunch of research into it
 

1465
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,870
i've done a bunch of research into it
and so i found a a

1466
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
and so i found a a
 

1467
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,710
and so i found a a
really simple easy way to make my own

1468
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
really simple easy way to make my own
 

1469
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,909
really simple easy way to make my own
pcb

1470
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
pcb
 

1471
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,190
pcb
and that's what we're going to be doing

1472
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
and that's what we're going to be doing
 

1473
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,789
and that's what we're going to be doing
so my project for the next probably a

1474
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
so my project for the next probably a
 

1475
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,909
so my project for the next probably a
couple of months

1476
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
couple of months
 

1477
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,590
couple of months
because i have to learn how this stuff

1478
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
because i have to learn how this stuff
 

1479
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,029
because i have to learn how this stuff
works is to

1480
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
works is to
 

1481
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,510
works is to
design a circuit board um which i've

1482
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
design a circuit board um which i've
 

1483
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,630
design a circuit board um which i've
never done before

1484
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
never done before
 

1485
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,110
never done before
make the circuit board and then my son's

1486
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
make the circuit board and then my son's
 

1487
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,310
make the circuit board and then my son's
going to solder it together and we're

1488
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
going to solder it together and we're
 

1489
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,909
going to solder it together and we're
going to make our own

1490
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
going to make our own
 

1491
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,190
going to make our own
useless box that i'm hoping to also 3d

1492
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
useless box that i'm hoping to also 3d
 

1493
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,950
useless box that i'm hoping to also 3d
print the box as well oh that's cool

1494
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
print the box as well oh that's cool
 

1495
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,510
print the box as well oh that's cool
yeah you're just diving right in i when

1496
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
yeah you're just diving right in i when
 

1497
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,470
yeah you're just diving right in i when
i do something i don't go small

1498
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
i do something i don't go small
 

1499
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,909
i do something i don't go small
and you know my approach is a little bit

1500
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
and you know my approach is a little bit
 

1501
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,310
and you know my approach is a little bit
different because i am very much

1502
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
different because i am very much
 

1503
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,549
different because i am very much
into like i like to learn something

1504
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
into like i like to learn something
 

1505
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,510
into like i like to learn something
first

1506
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
first
 

1507
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,789
first
and then increase my investment in

1508
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
and then increase my investment in
 

1509
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,190
and then increase my investment in
that process and and you're like talking

1510
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
that process and and you're like talking
 

1511
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,029
that process and and you're like talking
about jumping right to pcb

1512
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
about jumping right to pcb
 

1513
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,669
about jumping right to pcb
creation so i would back up so you know

1514
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
creation so i would back up so you know
 

1515
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,269
creation so i would back up so you know
if this is you thinking hey maybe i'd

1516
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
if this is you thinking hey maybe i'd
 

1517
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,789
if this is you thinking hey maybe i'd
like to be able to make my own circuits

1518
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
like to be able to make my own circuits
 

1519
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,070
like to be able to make my own circuits
and things like that

1520
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
and things like that
 

1521
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,389
and things like that
my starting point is a breadboard yes

1522
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:20,399
my starting point is a breadboard yes
 

1523
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,870
my starting point is a breadboard yes
and the breadboard allows you to lay out

1524
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
and the breadboard allows you to lay out
 

1525
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,430
and the breadboard allows you to lay out
your circuit that you've designed or

1526
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
your circuit that you've designed or
 

1527
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,990
your circuit that you've designed or
that you've

1528
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
that you've
 

1529
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,549
that you've
downloaded like a circuit blueprint um

1530
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
downloaded like a circuit blueprint um
 

1531
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,909
downloaded like a circuit blueprint um
from the internet or however

1532
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:29,919
from the internet or however
 

1533
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,389
from the internet or however
however you've got that lets you lay it

1534
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
however you've got that lets you lay it
 

1535
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:32,950
however you've got that lets you lay it
out on a

1536
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
out on a
 

1537
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,789
out on a
on a basically a mock pcb

1538
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
on a basically a mock pcb
 

1539
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,350
on a basically a mock pcb
that will function like a pcb but then

1540
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
that will function like a pcb but then
 

1541
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,029
that will function like a pcb but then
you can just take it all apart and

1542
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
you can just take it all apart and
 

1543
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,710
you can just take it all apart and
put the parts away right and it's cheap

1544
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
put the parts away right and it's cheap
 

1545
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,389
put the parts away right and it's cheap
very cheap and it just gets you started

1546
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:46,399
very cheap and it just gets you started
 

1547
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,389
very cheap and it just gets you started
and then the next step for me is what's

1548
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
and then the next step for me is what's
 

1549
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,070
and then the next step for me is what's
called a prototyping board so you get

1550
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
called a prototyping board so you get
 

1551
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,510
called a prototyping board so you get
pcb boards that

1552
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
pcb boards that
 

1553
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,269
pcb boards that
have all the holes that's right and

1554
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
have all the holes that's right and
 

1555
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,549
have all the holes that's right and
they've got solder

1556
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:54,559
they've got solder
 

1557
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,830
they've got solder
um like points but there's no

1558
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
um like points but there's no
 

1559
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,750
um like points but there's no
interconnection between them so you

1560
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
interconnection between them so you
 

1561
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,070
interconnection between them so you
actually run wires or you

1562
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
actually run wires or you
 

1563
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,909
actually run wires or you
run a little bit of solder between two

1564
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
run a little bit of solder between two
 

1565
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,750
run a little bit of solder between two
different joints for example

1566
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
different joints for example
 

1567
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,430
different joints for example
and you do it that way so that's my

1568
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
and you do it that way so that's my
 

1569
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,070
and you do it that way so that's my
second step yes then i would look at

1570
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
second step yes then i would look at
 

1571
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,789
second step yes then i would look at
maybe going the route of actually

1572
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
maybe going the route of actually
 

1573
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,710
maybe going the route of actually
etching your own

1574
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
etching your own
 

1575
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,510
etching your own
pcbs because then you're getting into

1576
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
pcbs because then you're getting into
 

1577
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,190
pcbs because then you're getting into
like the chemical processes

1578
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
like the chemical processes
 

1579
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,230
like the chemical processes
the and i'm i haven't researched it but

1580
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
the and i'm i haven't researched it but
 

1581
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,950
the and i'm i haven't researched it but
um it's a much more intricate process so

1582
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
um it's a much more intricate process so
 

1583
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,909
um it's a much more intricate process so
i like to start

1584
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
i like to start
 

1585
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,909
i like to start
a little bit simpler my first pcb i

1586
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
a little bit simpler my first pcb i
 

1587
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,510
a little bit simpler my first pcb i
built on a breadboard

1588
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
built on a breadboard
 

1589
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,070
built on a breadboard
very very basic but i designed it right

1590
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
very very basic but i designed it right
 

1591
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,789
very very basic but i designed it right
okay

1592
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
okay
 

1593
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,110
okay
and all it is is it takes a five volt

1594
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
and all it is is it takes a five volt
 

1595
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,830
and all it is is it takes a five volt
signal

1596
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
signal
 

1597
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,870
signal
and when it has five volts the

1598
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
and when it has five volts the
 

1599
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,269
and when it has five volts the
relay is closed so it has a relay right

1600
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
relay is closed so it has a relay right
 

1601
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,430
relay is closed so it has a relay right
okay when it does not have five volts

1602
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
okay when it does not have five volts
 

1603
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,990
okay when it does not have five volts
the relay

1604
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
the relay
 

1605
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,510
the relay
opens so it disconnects so

1606
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
opens so it disconnects so
 

1607
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,350
opens so it disconnects so
the reason that i created that it's a

1608
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
the reason that i created that it's a
 

1609
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,430
the reason that i created that it's a
purpose-built application so i built it

1610
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
purpose-built application so i built it
 

1611
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,549
purpose-built application so i built it
on a breadboard

1612
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:52,559
on a breadboard
 

1613
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,990
on a breadboard
and feeding at five volts is coming from

1614
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
and feeding at five volts is coming from
 

1615
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,230
and feeding at five volts is coming from
any guesses any guesses spc nope

1616
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
any guesses any guesses spc nope

it's another three letter acronym usb

1618
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
it's another three letter acronym usb
 

1619
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,230
it's another three letter acronym usb
usb usb pulling a five volt signal off

1620
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
usb usb pulling a five volt signal off
 

1621
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,350
usb usb pulling a five volt signal off
of a micro tick

1622
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
of a micro tick
 

1623
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,470
of a micro tick
router okay and so then in the micro

1624
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
router okay and so then in the micro
 

1625
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,389
router okay and so then in the micro
tick i programmed code that said

1626
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
tick i programmed code that said
 

1627
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,950
tick i programmed code that said
that basically to dumb it down if the

1628
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
that basically to dumb it down if the
 

1629
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,029
that basically to dumb it down if the
internet goes down

1630
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
internet goes down
 

1631
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,909
internet goes down
kill the power on the usb oh and so then

1632
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
kill the power on the usb oh and so then
 

1633
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,549
kill the power on the usb oh and so then
that

1634
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
that
 

1635
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,789
that
opens up the relay and what is the relay

1636
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
opens up the relay and what is the relay
 

1637
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,510
opens up the relay and what is the relay
control but the power to my modem

1638
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
control but the power to my modem
 

1639
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,389
control but the power to my modem
so my modem if the internet goes down

1640
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:28,399
so my modem if the internet goes down
 

1641
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,909
so my modem if the internet goes down
will automatically turn

1642
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:29,919
will automatically turn
 

1643
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,470
will automatically turn
the power of itself off because of my

1644
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,480
the power of itself off because of my
 

1645
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,110
the power of itself off because of my
relay

1646
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
relay
 

1647
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,430
relay
right and wait five seconds and then

1648
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
right and wait five seconds and then
 

1649
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,029
right and wait five seconds and then
power back on so it's essentially a

1650
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,039
power back on so it's essentially a
 

1651
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,630
power back on so it's essentially a
virtual version of

1652
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
virtual version of
 

1653
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,190
virtual version of
did you turn it off and on again because

1654
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
did you turn it off and on again because
 

1655
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,310
did you turn it off and on again because
what do you do when you're in an

1656
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
what do you do when you're in an
 

1657
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,669
what do you do when you're in an
internet goes down you pull the plug

1658
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
internet goes down you pull the plug
 

1659
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,350
internet goes down you pull the plug
from the momentum you wait five seconds

1660
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
from the momentum you wait five seconds
 

1661
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,789
from the momentum you wait five seconds
and you plug it back in and

1662
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
and you plug it back in and
 

1663
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,470
and you plug it back in and
you know eight times out of ten it's

1664
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,480
you know eight times out of ten it's
 

1665
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,230
you know eight times out of ten it's
going to come back up and be working

1666
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
going to come back up and be working
 

1667
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,389
going to come back up and be working
right so that was the circuit i built so

1668
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
right so that was the circuit i built so
 

1669
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,549
right so that was the circuit i built so
i built that on a prototyping board once

1670
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
i built that on a prototyping board once
 

1671
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,630
i built that on a prototyping board once
i had it working and i just soldered it

1672
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
i had it working and i just soldered it
 

1673
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,230
i had it working and i just soldered it
together and it's a very very simple

1674
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
together and it's a very very simple
 

1675
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,710
together and it's a very very simple
circuit

1676
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:58,720
circuit
 

1677
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,789
circuit
very cool and it worked great i like

1678
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
very cool and it worked great i like
 

1679
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,990
very cool and it worked great i like
that

1680
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
that
 

1681
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,710
that
very cool so tools what have you got so

1682
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
very cool so tools what have you got so
 

1683
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,830
very cool so tools what have you got so
far where are you at

1684
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
far where are you at
 

1685
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,070
far where are you at
uh well like i said i've just been doing

1686
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
uh well like i said i've just been doing
 

1687
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,149
uh well like i said i've just been doing
the research this past week oh so

and i've got a component kit that's on
 

1705
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,350
and i've got a component kit that's on
the way with all the

1706
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
the way with all the
 

1707
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,430
the way with all the
resistors and capacitors right yeah all

1708

too is that these
 

1713
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,549
too is that these
these days i mean you can't really walk

1714
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
these days i mean you can't really walk
 

1715
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,990
these days i mean you can't really walk
into a radio shack like we used to be

1716
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,000
into a radio shack like we used to be
 

1717
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,029
into a radio shack like we used to be
able to there no

1718
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
able to there no
 

1719
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,350
able to there no
there are still stores like here in

1720
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
there are still stores like here in
 

1721
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,669
there are still stores like here in
barrie we have one called seaal

1722

barrie we have one called seaal
 

1723
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,590
barrie we have one called seaal
which is a brilliant store that's kind

1724
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,600
which is a brilliant store that's kind
 

1725
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,029
which is a brilliant store that's kind
of like that old radio shack where you

1726
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
of like that old radio shack where you
 

1727
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:47,590
of like that old radio shack where you
go in and

1728
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
go in and
 

1729
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,389
go in and
it's like i just need one capacitor yeah

1730

and it's like
 

1733
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,870
and it's like
here you go you know it's like drawers

1734
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
here you go you know it's like drawers
 

1735
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,870
here you go you know it's like drawers
and drawers of capacitors and resistors

and it comes with a breadboard and that
 

1751
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,669
and it comes with a breadboard and that
was one of the things is is i wanna like

1752
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
was one of the things is is i wanna like
 

1753
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,269
was one of the things is is i wanna like
yes i'm gonna be designing it but part

1754
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
yes i'm gonna be designing it but part
 

1755
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,190
yes i'm gonna be designing it but part
of the planning process is just like you

1756
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
of the planning process is just like you
 

1757
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,630
of the planning process is just like you
said using the breadboard to figure out

1758
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
said using the breadboard to figure out
 

1759
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,230
said using the breadboard to figure out
how the circuitry is gonna go

1760
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
how the circuitry is gonna go
 

1761
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,509
how the circuitry is gonna go
and that's gonna be a great learning

1762
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
and that's gonna be a great learning
 

1763
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,789
and that's gonna be a great learning
experience for luke because they'll be

1764
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
experience for luke because they'll be
 

1765
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,830
experience for luke because they'll be
like hey this is

1766
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
like hey this is
 

1767
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,269
like hey this is
how does this work and let's try this

1768
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
how does this work and let's try this
 

1769
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,190
how does this work and let's try this
and let's do that and then

1770
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,200
and let's do that and then
 

1771
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,549
and let's do that and then
you know we'll be able to try on there

1772
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:24,559
you know we'll be able to try on there
 

1773
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,070
you know we'll be able to try on there
without actually making our own pieces

1774
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
without actually making our own pieces
 

1775
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,509
without actually making our own pieces
that's really neat you mentioned also

1776
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,519
that's really neat you mentioned also
 

1777
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,870
that's really neat you mentioned also
arduino and arduino is kind of

1778
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
arduino and arduino is kind of
 

1779
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,430
arduino and arduino is kind of
like it's a controller so yeah you know

1780
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
like it's a controller so yeah you know
 

1781
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,149
like it's a controller so yeah you know
whereas

1782
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
whereas
 

1783
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,909
whereas
a raspberry pi or other single board

1784
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
a raspberry pi or other single board
 

1785
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,190
a raspberry pi or other single board
computer is a true

1786
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
computer is a true
 

1787
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,950
computer is a true
real computer with an operating system

1788
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
real computer with an operating system
 

1789
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,190
real computer with an operating system
and everything an arduino is like you

1790
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,200
and everything an arduino is like you
 

1791
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,630
and everything an arduino is like you
just program it to do

1792
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:42,640
just program it to do
 

1793
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,509
just program it to do
a very specific task it's a solid state

1794
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
a very specific task it's a solid state
 

1795
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:45,990
a very specific task it's a solid state
and

1796
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
and
 

1797
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,950
and
it will respond to and i think this is

1798
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
it will respond to and i think this is
 

1799
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,029
it will respond to and i think this is
why it would work really well an arduino

1800
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:51,039
why it would work really well an arduino
 

1801
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,830
why it would work really well an arduino
for

1802
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
for
 

1803
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,269
for
uh for a useless box is because it's

1804
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:55,279
uh for a useless box is because it's
 

1805
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:55,669
uh for a useless box is because it's
like

1806
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
like
 

1807
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,350
like
it's either on or off that's right and

1808
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
it's either on or off that's right and
 

1809
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,190
it's either on or off that's right and
if it's on do this

1810
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
if it's on do this
 

1811
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,430
if it's on do this
and then it will turn off that's right

1812
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,440
and then it will turn off that's right
 

1813
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,190
and then it will turn off that's right
so very very basic programming

1814
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
so very very basic programming
 

1815
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,870
so very very basic programming
digital write four

1816
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
digital write four
 

1817
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,909
digital write four
comma hi hi semicolon and then we're

1818
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
comma hi hi semicolon and then we're
 

1819
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,590
comma hi hi semicolon and then we're
gonna delay for one second which is one

1820
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
gonna delay for one second which is one
 

1821
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,509
gonna delay for one second which is one
thousand milliseconds

1822
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
thousand milliseconds
 

1823
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,310
thousand milliseconds
and then we're going to copy that line

1824
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
and then we're going to copy that line
 

1825
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,029
and then we're going to copy that line
now

1826
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
now
 

1827
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,590
now
what do you think high means versus low

1828
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:19,600
what do you think high means versus low
 

1829
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,950
what do you think high means versus low
which is what i'm going to put here

1830
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
which is what i'm going to put here
 

1831
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,630
which is what i'm going to put here
just a guess on or off yes

1832
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:24,640
just a guess on or off yes
 

1833
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,430
just a guess on or off yes
so that's what my circuit now looks like

1834
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
so that's what my circuit now looks like
 

1835
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,190
so that's what my circuit now looks like
and i'm going to simply plug this in

1836
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,200
and i'm going to simply plug this in
 

1837
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,389
and i'm going to simply plug this in
to usb power so i'm not plugging it into

1838
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
to usb power so i'm not plugging it into
 

1839
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,350
to usb power so i'm not plugging it into
the computer i want to

1840
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360
the computer i want to
 

1841
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,230
the computer i want to
actually power this device and see if it

1842
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
actually power this device and see if it
 

1843
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,669
actually power this device and see if it
runs my program

1844
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
runs my program
 

1845
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,830
runs my program
and if it does we should see this light

1846
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,840
and if it does we should see this light
 

1847
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,950
and if it does we should see this light
flash there we go

1848
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:42,960
flash there we go
 

1849
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,269
flash there we go
that is neat every one second so we

1850
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
that is neat every one second so we
 

1851
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,110
that is neat every one second so we
actually created the circuit

1852
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,120
actually created the circuit
 

1853
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,590
actually created the circuit
fairly quickly uh and created the

1854
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
fairly quickly uh and created the
 

1855
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,909
fairly quickly uh and created the
program to now tell this light

1856
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
program to now tell this light
 

1857
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,909
program to now tell this light
what to do and we told it just very

1858
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:53,919
what to do and we told it just very
 

1859
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,269
what to do and we told it just very
simply

1860
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
simply
 

1861
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,750
simply
turn on and off again but if you're

1862
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:57,760
turn on and off again but if you're
 

1863
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,190
turn on and off again but if you're
making your own circuit you've got to

1864
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
making your own circuit you've got to
 

1865
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,669
making your own circuit you've got to
like do

1866
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
like do
 

1867
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,470
like do
ics you've got to program it yourself

1868
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:02,480
ics you've got to program it yourself
 

1869
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,149
ics you've got to program it yourself
yup you've got to figure out how

1870
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,159
yup you've got to figure out how
 

1871
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,789
yup you've got to figure out how
wow i want to see this project as a work

1872
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
wow i want to see this project as a work
 

1873
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,909
wow i want to see this project as a work
in progress

in progress
 

1875
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,149
in progress
okay and then see how uh how it comes

1876
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
okay and then see how uh how it comes
 

1877
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,830
okay and then see how uh how it comes
together yeah sounds good

1878

to help
and uh and that's something that i think

1920
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
and uh and that's something that i think
 

1921
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,630
and uh and that's something that i think
that i think that'll make a really neat

1922
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640
that i think that'll make a really neat
 

1923
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,990
that i think that'll make a really neat
feature for the show as well as you

learn
yeah for sure keep us posted on that

1928
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:55,760
yeah for sure keep us posted on that
 

1929
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,190
yeah for sure keep us posted on that
jeff definitely i'd really be interested

1930
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
jeff definitely i'd really be interested
 

1931
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,470
jeff definitely i'd really be interested
to know how things go

1932
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,480
to know how things go
 

1933
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,149
to know how things go
yeah i'll be posting things behind the

1934
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:00,159
yeah i'll be posting things behind the
 

1935
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,230
yeah i'll be posting things behind the
scenes a useless box any other

1936
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
scenes a useless box any other
 

1937
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,310
scenes a useless box any other
do you have any ideas yet i get excited

1938
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,320
do you have any ideas yet i get excited
 

1939
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,029
do you have any ideas yet i get excited
when i

1940
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,039
when i
 

1941
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,510
when i
invent like when i think of something

1942
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,520
invent like when i think of something
 

1943
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,790
invent like when i think of something
have you had any of those

1944
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
have you had any of those
 

1945
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,190
have you had any of those
moments where i'm like i really wish i

1946
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
moments where i'm like i really wish i
 

1947
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,869
moments where i'm like i really wish i
had something that would do this but it

1948
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
had something that would do this but it
 

1949
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,230
had something that would do this but it
doesn't exist

1950
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
doesn't exist
 

1951
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,990
doesn't exist
this is where 3d printing is interesting

1952
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
this is where 3d printing is interesting
 

1953
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,069
this is where 3d printing is interesting
to me because i'm creating things that

1954
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
to me because i'm creating things that
 

1955
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,869
to me because i'm creating things that
don't exist yet i i haven't really

1956
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879
don't exist yet i i haven't really
 

1957
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,510
don't exist yet i i haven't really
thought

1958
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,520
thought
 

1959
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,149
thought
that far as to what exists and doesn't

1960
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
that far as to what exists and doesn't
 

1961
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,510
that far as to what exists and doesn't
exist

1962
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
exist
 

1963
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,950
exist
um

1964
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960

 

1965
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,790

no i haven't really thought that far

1966
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:32,800
no i haven't really thought that far
 

1967
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,990
no i haven't really thought that far
come up with some ideas

1968
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
come up with some ideas
 

1969
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,990
come up with some ideas
yeah and share those there's a ton of

1970
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,000
yeah and share those there's a ton of
 

1971
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,030
yeah and share those there's a ton of
things for sure

1972
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
things for sure
 

1973
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,310
things for sure
yeah like i've always wanted to do um

1974
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
yeah like i've always wanted to do um
 

1975
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,669
yeah like i've always wanted to do um
us um a housewide sound system

1976
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
us um a housewide sound system
 

1977
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,869
us um a housewide sound system
that links up to um you know

1978
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
that links up to um you know
 

1979
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,869
that links up to um you know
our our amazon device and stuff like

1980
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
our our amazon device and stuff like
 

1981
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,030
our our amazon device and stuff like
that but i would like to have sensors

1982
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
that but i would like to have sensors
 

1983
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,069
that but i would like to have sensors
where

1984
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
where
 

1985
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,710
where
when i walk from one room to another the

1986
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:54,720
when i walk from one room to another the
 

1987
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,310
when i walk from one room to another the
motion sensor kicks in and it will shut

1988
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,320
motion sensor kicks in and it will shut
 

1989
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,750
motion sensor kicks in and it will shut
off the one room speakers

1990
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:57,760
off the one room speakers
 

1991
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,750
off the one room speakers
and add it to where i've just gone

1992
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
and add it to where i've just gone
 

1993
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,750
and add it to where i've just gone
that's way more advanced but that's

1994
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
that's way more advanced but that's
 

1995
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:01,990
that's way more advanced but that's
probably

1996
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
probably
 

1997
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,349
probably
the only thing i can think of where i'm

1998
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
the only thing i can think of where i'm
 

1999
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,109
the only thing i can think of where i'm
like i want to do this but see you talk

2000
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,119
like i want to do this but see you talk
 

2001
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,950
like i want to do this but see you talk
about that and then i think okay well

2002
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:06,960
about that and then i think okay well
 

2003
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,950
about that and then i think okay well
you could use a passive infrared sensor

2004
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
you could use a passive infrared sensor
 

2005
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,349
you could use a passive infrared sensor
yep which is used in motion sensors

2006
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
yep which is used in motion sensors
 

2007
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,630
yep which is used in motion sensors
you could use a laser sensor but

2008
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
you could use a laser sensor but
 

2009
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,829
you could use a laser sensor but
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's

2010
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's
 

2011
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,190
pir is very very cheap yes yeah and it's
just a little sensor that it's like

2012
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
just a little sensor that it's like
 

2013
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,270
just a little sensor that it's like
okay there was motion do something yeah

2014
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,280
okay there was motion do something yeah
 

2015
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,870
okay there was motion do something yeah
so you could create something

2016
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:22,880
so you could create something
 

2017
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,990
so you could create something
again with a relay that controls just

2018
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
again with a relay that controls just
 

2019
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,510
again with a relay that controls just
whether the speaker has

2020
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:27,520
whether the speaker has
 

2021
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,990
whether the speaker has
a completed circuit or not yeah so if it

2022
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
a completed circuit or not yeah so if it
 

2023
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,589
a completed circuit or not yeah so if it
was just a

2024
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
was just a
 

2025
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,190
was just a
bunch of speakers connected through an

2026
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
bunch of speakers connected through an
 

2027
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,150
bunch of speakers connected through an
amplifier you could have relays set up

2028
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
amplifier you could have relays set up
 

2029
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,150
amplifier you could have relays set up
with pir sensors that you'd be able to

2030
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
with pir sensors that you'd be able to
 

2031
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,990
with pir sensors that you'd be able to
control by motion

2032
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,000
control by motion
 

2033
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,550
control by motion
yeah good and if there's no motion for

2034
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:42,560
yeah good and if there's no motion for
 

2035
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,150
yeah good and if there's no motion for
10 minutes turn off the speaker

2036
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
10 minutes turn off the speaker
 

2037
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,349
10 minutes turn off the speaker
automatically or something like that

2038
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:45,359
automatically or something like that
 

2039
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:45,750
automatically or something like that
yeah

2040
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
yeah
 

2041
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,750
yeah
exactly so like these kinds of ideas

2042
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
exactly so like these kinds of ideas
 

2043
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,190
exactly so like these kinds of ideas
like there's so much stuff that you can

2044
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
like there's so much stuff that you can
 

2045
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,990
like there's so much stuff that you can
do

2046
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
do
 

2047
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,349
do
when you start to understand and then

2048
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
when you start to understand and then
 

2049
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,270
when you start to understand and then
there's the whole flip side of it where

2050
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,280
there's the whole flip side of it where
 

2051
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,829
there's the whole flip side of it where
something breaks and you can fix it yes

2052
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:55,839
something breaks and you can fix it yes
 

2053
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,430
something breaks and you can fix it yes
that's a good feeling

2054
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
that's a good feeling
 

2055
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,190
that's a good feeling
and that's done we've done that already

2056
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
and that's done we've done that already
 

2057
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,870
and that's done we've done that already
yeah nice so

2058
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:00,880
yeah nice so
 

2059
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,990
yeah nice so
you know you get those little battery

2060
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
you know you get those little battery
 

2061
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,950
you know you get those little battery
testers uh like to check the charge

2062
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,960
testers uh like to check the charge
 

2063
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,270
testers uh like to check the charge
yeah so we had one of those and it's

2064
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
yeah so we had one of those and it's
 

2065
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,470
yeah so we had one of those and it's
funny when my son was building his

2066
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
funny when my son was building his
 

2067
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,190
funny when my son was building his
calculator

2068
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200
calculator
 

2069
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,310
calculator
we weren't sure if the batteries were

2070
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
we weren't sure if the batteries were
 

2071
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,550
we weren't sure if the batteries were
working and we weren't getting anything

2072
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
working and we weren't getting anything
 

2073
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,910
working and we weren't getting anything
i'm like this is odd that we're not

2074
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,920
i'm like this is odd that we're not
 

2075
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,750
i'm like this is odd that we're not
getting usually even if it's dead it

2076
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:15,760
getting usually even if it's dead it
 

2077
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,630
getting usually even if it's dead it
pops into the red

2078
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:16,640
pops into the red
 

2079
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,630
pops into the red
but there was nothing so we opened it up

2080
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:18,640
but there was nothing so we opened it up
 

2081
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,470
but there was nothing so we opened it up
turns out the

2082
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
turns out the
 

2083
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,950
turns out the
actual connection had broken apart oh

2084
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
actual connection had broken apart oh

let's say something comes into e-waste

2196
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
let's say something comes into e-waste
 

2197
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,910
let's say something comes into e-waste
or you you know you find something at

2198
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
or you you know you find something at
 

2199
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,950
or you you know you find something at
the side of the road that someone's just

2200
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
the side of the road that someone's just
 

2201
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,310
the side of the road that someone's just
discarded because they can't they don't

2202
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,320
discarded because they can't they don't
 

2203
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,589
discarded because they can't they don't
know how to fix it

2204
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:23,599
know how to fix it
 

2205
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,470
know how to fix it
um and maybe if fixing it is more

2206
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,480
um and maybe if fixing it is more
 

2207
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,150
um and maybe if fixing it is more
expensive than buying a new one in a lot

2208
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,160
expensive than buying a new one in a lot
 

2209
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,069
expensive than buying a new one in a lot
of cases too

2210
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,079
of cases too
 

2211
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,270
of cases too
um you can even if you can't fix it

2212
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,280
um you can even if you can't fix it
 

2213
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,109
um you can even if you can't fix it
you can do what's called desoldering

2214
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:35,119
you can do what's called desoldering
 

2215
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,710
you can do what's called desoldering
that's right so you can remove

2216
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
that's right so you can remove
 

2217
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,430
that's right so you can remove
all the good components from that and

2218
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,440
all the good components from that and
 

2219
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,349
all the good components from that and
put them in a drawer organizer yes

2220
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,359
put them in a drawer organizer yes
 

2221
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,109
put them in a drawer organizer yes
so that you can then have your own radio

2222
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
so that you can then have your own radio
 

2223

00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:27,839
windows 10. well i don't want to upgrade
 

2567
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,670
windows 10. well i don't want to upgrade
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.

2568
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:29,680
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
 

2569
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,990
to windows 10 i like my windows 7.
i understand that and i respect that

2570
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,000
i understand that and i respect that
 

2571
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,430
i understand that and i respect that
however

2572
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
however
 

2573
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,109
however
here's the problem hackers

2574
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:37,119
here's the problem hackers
 

2575
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,069
here's the problem hackers
now are able to exploit these operating

2576
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
now are able to exploit these operating
 

2577
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,589
now are able to exploit these operating
systems

2578
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:41,599
systems
 

2579
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,550
systems
and as they do that as they find

2580
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,560
and as they do that as they find
 

2581
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,829
and as they do that as they find
exploits

2582
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
exploits
 

2583
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,510
exploits
there's a couple of things that happen

2584
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
there's a couple of things that happen
 

2585
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,950
there's a couple of things that happen
one they

2586
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
one they
 

2587
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,470
one they
either give away or sell those exploits

2588
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
either give away or sell those exploits
 

2589
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,510
either give away or sell those exploits
or two they're just they're released

2590
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,520
or two they're just they're released
 

2591
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,950
or two they're just they're released
to the public through whether it's

2592
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
to the public through whether it's
 

2593
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,510
to the public through whether it's
through the dark web or even on github

2594
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:01,520
through the dark web or even on github
 

2595
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,349
through the dark web or even on github
as as security research and so now

2596
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
as as security research and so now
 

2597
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,829
as as security research and so now
these hackers if you will we're going to

2598
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:07,839
these hackers if you will we're going to
 

2599
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,990
these hackers if you will we're going to
call them that but realistically

2600
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,000
call them that but realistically
 

2601
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,589
call them that but realistically
in a lot of cases they're what we call

2602
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
in a lot of cases they're what we call
 

2603
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,349
in a lot of cases they're what we call
script kitties

2604
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:13,359
script kitties
 

2605
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,790
script kitties
and these are um

2606
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
and these are um
 

2607
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,829
and these are um
not even like hackers yes but they don't

2608
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
not even like hackers yes but they don't
 

2609
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,670
not even like hackers yes but they don't
have to have a lot of knowledge because

2610
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:21,680
have to have a lot of knowledge because
 

2611
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,190
have to have a lot of knowledge because
the the exploit is publicly

2612
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
the the exploit is publicly
 

2613
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,150
the the exploit is publicly
that's right known and understood so if

2614
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,160
that's right known and understood so if
 

2615
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,150
that's right known and understood so if
there are exploits that are available

2616
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
there are exploits that are available
 

2617
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,309
there are exploits that are available
for an operating system

2618
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:32,319
for an operating system
 

2619
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,630
for an operating system
what do we expect to happen we expect

2620
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
what do we expect to happen we expect
 

2621
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,870
what do we expect to happen we expect
the operating system vendor microsoft in

2622
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
the operating system vendor microsoft in
 

2623
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,829
the operating system vendor microsoft in
this case

2624
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:37,839
this case
 

2625
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,190
this case
to patch that exploit to fix it

2626
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,200
to patch that exploit to fix it
 

2627
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,829
to patch that exploit to fix it
and that's the case with windows 10.

2628
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:43,839
and that's the case with windows 10.
 

2629
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:44,550
and that's the case with windows 10.
sadly though

2630
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:44,560
sadly though
 

2631
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,950
sadly though
those that are eol it's not the case

2632
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
those that are eol it's not the case
 

2633
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,030
those that are eol it's not the case
with an eol operating system sometimes

2634
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
with an eol operating system sometimes
 

2635
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,230
with an eol operating system sometimes
we hear oh well i don't need support

2636
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
we hear oh well i don't need support
 

2637
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,069
we hear oh well i don't need support
well microsoft has ended support that's

2638
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
well microsoft has ended support that's
 

2639
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,829
well microsoft has ended support that's
what we've heard yeah they've ended

2640
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:55,839
what we've heard yeah they've ended
 

2641
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,430
what we've heard yeah they've ended
support for windows 7. they've ended

2642
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440
support for windows 7. they've ended
 

2643
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,430
support for windows 7. they've ended
support for windows xp

2644
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
support for windows xp
 

2645
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,910
support for windows xp
oh but i i've never had to call support

2646
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:01,920
oh but i i've never had to call support
 

2647
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,630
oh but i i've never had to call support
i can

2648
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:02,640
i can
 

2649
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,630
i can
handle it that's not what they're

2650
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
handle it that's not what they're
 

2651
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,230
handle it that's not what they're
talking about at all what they're saying

2652
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
talking about at all what they're saying
 

2653
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:06,630
talking about at all what they're saying
is

2654
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:06,640
is
 

2655
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,230
is
they will not fix the patches

2656
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
they will not fix the patches
 

2657
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,630
they will not fix the patches
it does the the exploits doesn't matter

2658
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
it does the the exploits doesn't matter
 

2659
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,630
it does the the exploits doesn't matter
how severe they are

2660
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
how severe they are
 

2661
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,150
how severe they are
it doesn't matter how easy they are to

2662
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,160
it doesn't matter how easy they are to
 

2663
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,030
it doesn't matter how easy they are to
exploit so you have a windows 7 machine

2664
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,040
exploit so you have a windows 7 machine
 

2665
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,069
exploit so you have a windows 7 machine
on your network well

2666
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:20,079
on your network well
 

2667
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,670
on your network well
you are giving entry to

2668
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
you are giving entry to
 

2669
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,309
you are giving entry to
one of these hackers who don't even have

2670
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:26,319
one of these hackers who don't even have
 

2671
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,990
one of these hackers who don't even have
to be very good at hacking

2672
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
to be very good at hacking
 

2673
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,030
to be very good at hacking
because the exploits are publicly known

2674
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
because the exploits are publicly known
 

2675
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,309
because the exploits are publicly known
yep sometimes they're part of tools

2676
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
yep sometimes they're part of tools
 

2677
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,230
yep sometimes they're part of tools
sometimes they can just download a free

2678
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,240
sometimes they can just download a free
 

2679
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,069
sometimes they can just download a free
tool and they can say i want to

2680
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:38,079
tool and they can say i want to
 

2681
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,430
tool and they can say i want to
with one check exploit windows 7

2682
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,440
with one check exploit windows 7
 

2683
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,309
with one check exploit windows 7
and so they get into a windows 7 box or

2684
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
and so they get into a windows 7 box or
 

2685
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,390
and so they get into a windows 7 box or
they've tricked one of your employees

2686
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,400
they've tricked one of your employees
 

2687
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,910
they've tricked one of your employees
even if they're just somebody in the

2688
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,920
even if they're just somebody in the
 

2689
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,870
even if they're just somebody in the

00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
back working in the warehouse
 

2691
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,710
back working in the warehouse
they've tricked somebody into opening a

2692
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,720
they've tricked somebody into opening a
 

2693
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,109
they've tricked somebody into opening a
file that now gives them access to the

2694
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:55,119
file that now gives them access to the
 

2695
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,950

kids are being homeschooled now

3548
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:04,960
kids are being homeschooled now
 

3549
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,589
kids are being homeschooled now
kind of by force and everybody's on

3550
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:07,599
kind of by force and everybody's on
 

3551

kind of by force and everybody's on
their devices the whole time so we've

3552
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
their devices the whole time so we've
 

3553
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,829
their devices the whole time so we've
got zoom meetings happening on phones

3554
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
got zoom meetings happening on phones
 

3555
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:12,470
got zoom meetings happening on phones
and

3556
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:12,480
and
 

3557
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,589
and
and it runs it depletes the battery yes

3558
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:15,599
and it runs it depletes the battery yes
 

3559
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,630
and it runs it depletes the battery yes
but what i like is that it's wireless

3560
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640
but what i like is that it's wireless
 

3561
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,430
but what i like is that it's wireless
it's not just wired that's amazing yeah

3562
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
it's not just wired that's amazing yeah
 

3563
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:21,750
it's not just wired that's amazing yeah
it's

3564
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:21,760
it's
 

3565
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,470
it's
wireless that's huge like the idea that

3566
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
wireless that's huge like the idea that
 

3567
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,750
wireless that's huge like the idea that
i could take my phone

3568
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
i could take my phone
 

3569
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,190
i could take my phone
not have to worry about chargers and

3570
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
not have to worry about chargers and
 

3571
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,510
not have to worry about chargers and
just go just set it down set it down 20

3572
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
just go just set it down set it down 20
 

3573
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,950
just go just set it down set it down 20
minutes later i'm good to go

3574
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:30,960
minutes later i'm good to go
 

3575
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,190
minutes later i'm good to go
that i love the other thing that i love

3576
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:33,200
that i love the other thing that i love
 

3577
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:33,990
that i love the other thing that i love
about it

3578
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,000
about it
 

3579
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,589
about it
the the concept is that um

3580
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:37,599
the the concept is that um
 

3581
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,470
the the concept is that um
i think about as you just did if i could

3582
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
i think about as you just did if i could
 

3583
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,069
i think about as you just did if i could
set it down on a table

3584
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:42,079
set it down on a table
 

3585
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,349
set it down on a table
what if you could set it down on a

3586
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
what if you could set it down on a
 

3587
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,510
what if you could set it down on a
restaurant table yes because a lot of

3588
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
restaurant table yes because a lot of
 

3589
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,670
restaurant table yes because a lot of
restaurants have gone the route and i'm

3590
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
restaurants have gone the route and i'm
 

3591
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,109
restaurants have gone the route and i'm
using restaurants as the example but a

3592
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
using restaurants as the example but a
 

3593
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,789
using restaurants as the example but a
lot of places have gone the route of

3594
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:50,799
lot of places have gone the route of
 

3595
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,430
lot of places have gone the route of
embedding usb yes so that you can plug

3596
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
embedding usb yes so that you can plug
 

3597
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,470
embedding usb yes so that you can plug
in your usb

3598
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:54,480
in your usb
 

3599
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,270
in your usb
cable to charge your phone but then all

3600
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:57,280
cable to charge your phone but then all
 

3601
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,630
cable to charge your phone but then all
of a sudden people got

3602
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:58,640
of a sudden people got
 

3603
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,829
of a sudden people got
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports

3604
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:01,839
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports
 

3605
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,190
wise to the fact that oh those usb ports
could be malicious

3606
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
could be malicious
 

3607
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,990
could be malicious
because usb also carries data or that's

3608
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
because usb also carries data or that's
 

3609
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,309
because usb also carries data or that's
right

3610
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
right
 

3611
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,549
right
who knows if it's too many volts and

3612
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:08,559
who knows if it's too many volts and
 

3613
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,990
who knows if it's too many volts and
that you know maybe it's

3614
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,000
that you know maybe it's
 

3615
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,750
that you know maybe it's
got a short or something like that and

3616
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:11,760
got a short or something like that and
 

3617
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,270
got a short or something like that and
could fry my phone

3618
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,280
could fry my phone
 

3619
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,950
could fry my phone
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to

3620
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to
 

3621
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,029
so then all of a sudden we're afraid to
plug into the usb port because hey

3622
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:17,039
plug into the usb port because hey
 

3623
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,829
plug into the usb port because hey
it could be something bad that's right

3624
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:19,839
it could be something bad that's right
 

3625
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:20,390
it could be something bad that's right
well

3626
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
well
 

3627
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,430
well
wireless charging you set it down it

3628
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
wireless charging you set it down it
 

3629
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,950
wireless charging you set it down it
charges and you pick it up and you're

3630
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
charges and you pick it up and you're
 

3631
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,430
charges and you pick it up and you're
done

3632
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
done
 

3633
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,230
done
yeah but you can set it down for like

3634
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
yeah but you can set it down for like
 

3635
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,670
yeah but you can set it down for like
three minutes and it's given you enough

3636
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:29,680
three minutes and it's given you enough
 

3637
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,109
three minutes and it's given you enough
of a charge to get through most of the

3638
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
of a charge to get through most of the
 

3639
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:31,750
of a charge to get through most of the
afternoon

3640
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
afternoon
 

3641
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,670
afternoon
which is incredible awesome i i think

3645
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,549
just as a i mean you look around now and
you've got all these charge stations for

3646
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
you've got all these charge stations for
 

3647
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,109
you've got all these charge stations for
electric vehicles it would be great to

3648
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
electric vehicles it would be great to
 

3649
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,069
electric vehicles it would be great to
start seeing little

3650
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
start seeing little
 

3651

and it's all wirelessly i just pictured
 

3663
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,190
and it's all wirelessly i just pictured
like a stretch of road

3664
01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,200
like a stretch of road
 

3665
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,750
like a stretch of road
and embed the receiver in the car and it

3666

and embed the receiver in the car and it
 

3667
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,950

recharges the

3668
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
recharges the
 

3669
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,589

said
is very sci-fi like when we were growing

3686
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:18,319
is very sci-fi like when we were growing
 

3687
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,270
is very sci-fi like when we were growing
up that was like

3688
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:19,280
up that was like
 

3689
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,589
up that was like
the future it's totally doable it's

3690

possible now yep
 

3693
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,910
possible now yep
that's ridiculous the raspberry pi

3694
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920

i tell you this story because then i

4000
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
i tell you this story because then i
 

4001
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,669
i tell you this story because then i
said to myself well

4002
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:29,679
said to myself well
 

4003
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,350
said to myself well
i see words and i and i

4004
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360
i see words and i and i
 

4005
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,110
i see words and i and i
i think for the most part i pronounce

4006
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
i think for the most part i pronounce
 

4007
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,350
i think for the most part i pronounce
them fairly meticulously so when i see

4008
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:37,360
them fairly meticulously so when i see
 

4009
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,310
them fairly meticulously so when i see
literary even though that's not a word i

4010
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
literary even though that's not a word i
 

4011
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,990
literary even though that's not a word i
set it the way it reads

4012
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,000
set it the way it reads
 

4013
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,790
set it the way it reads
right so i thought i'd probably be a

4014
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:44,800
right so i thought i'd probably be a
 

4015
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,229
right so i thought i'd probably be a
pretty good proofreader

4016
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:46,239
pretty good proofreader
 

4017
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,669
pretty good proofreader
