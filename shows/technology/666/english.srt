i want to get into 3d
 

179
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,309
i want to get into 3d
printing how do i get started and we

180
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
printing how do i get started and we
 

181
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,390
printing how do i get started and we
were setting up for me to come in

182
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
were setting up for me to come in
 

183
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,309
were setting up for me to come in
to their makerspace to start 3d printing

184
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
to their makerspace to start 3d printing
 

185
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,869
to their makerspace to start 3d printing
for the very first vid well and that's

186
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
for the very first vid well and that's
 

187
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,149
for the very first vid well and that's
what happened so

188
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
what happened so
 

189
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,710
what happened so
they had to shut down their maker space

190
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
they had to shut down their maker space
 

191
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,630
they had to shut down their maker space
as i was already kind of learning so

192
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
as i was already kind of learning so
 

193
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,949
as i was already kind of learning so
they

194
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
they
 

195
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,309
they
they taught me that okay well you need

196
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
they taught me that okay well you need
 

197
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,710
they taught me that okay well you need
to have these stl models and

198
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
to have these stl models and
 

199
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,149
to have these stl models and
so that's how i learned about things

200
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
so that's how i learned about things
 

201
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,750
so that's how i learned about things
like thingiverse and

202
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
like thingiverse and
 

203
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,910
like thingiverse and
sites like sites like that where people

204
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
sites like sites like that where people
 

205
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,710
sites like sites like that where people
share their designs

206
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
share their designs
 

207
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,670
share their designs
but because they closed down i couldn't

208
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
but because they closed down i couldn't
 

209
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,190
but because they closed down i couldn't
actually print anything

210
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
actually print anything
 

211
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,630
actually print anything
yeah but i didn't stop there i kept

212
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
yeah but i didn't stop there i kept
 

213
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,110
yeah but i didn't stop there i kept
trying to learn how to do 3d printing to

214
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
trying to learn how to do 3d printing to
 

215
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,710
trying to learn how to do 3d printing to
see because i wanted to see

216
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
see because i wanted to see
 

217
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,149
see because i wanted to see
is is it something that's going to be

218
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
is is it something that's going to be
 

219
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,030
is is it something that's going to be
practical so i started doing designs

220
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
practical so i started doing designs
 

221
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,149
practical so i started doing designs
on my computer before i even had

222
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
on my computer before i even had
 

223
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,429
on my computer before i even had
a printer even selected a printer so

224
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
a printer even selected a printer so
 

225
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,869
a printer even selected a printer so
i think that was a really good way for

226
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
i think that was a really good way for
 

227
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,869
i think that was a really good way for
me to do it because it gave me a chance

228
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
me to do it because it gave me a chance
 

229
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,429
me to do it because it gave me a chance
to learn

230
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
to learn
 

231
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,830
to learn
some of the ins and outs of how to do it

232
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
some of the ins and outs of how to do it
 

233
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,710
some of the ins and outs of how to do it
these hooks

234
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
these hooks
 

235
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,229

well not the reason i wanted to get into
 

243
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,350
well not the reason i wanted to get into
3d printing but

244
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
3d printing but
 

245
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,190
3d printing but
right and we'll talk about it after i

246
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
right and we'll talk about it after i
 

247
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,270
right and we'll talk about it after i
show you how how i've assembled this

248
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
show you how how i've assembled this
 

249
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,190
show you how how i've assembled this
um but the hooks that i'm going to show

250
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
um but the hooks that i'm going to show
 

251
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,670
um but the hooks that i'm going to show
you are a big part of

252
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
you are a big part of
 

253
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,550
you are a big part of
you know one of the ideas that i had so

254
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
you know one of the ideas that i had so
 

255
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,670
you know one of the ideas that i had so
simple too

256

simple too
 

257
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,950
simple too

i'm learning um and you're going to be
 

271
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,870
i'm learning um and you're going to be
able to learn along with me so i'm

272
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
able to learn along with me so i'm
 

273
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,830
able to learn along with me so i'm
taking the approach i'm not trying to be

274
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
taking the approach i'm not trying to be
 

275
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,230
taking the approach i'm not trying to be
that you know there are a lot of gurus

276
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
that you know there are a lot of gurus
 

277
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,909
that you know there are a lot of gurus
3d printing gurus who have been doing

278
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
3d printing gurus who have been doing
 

279
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,270
3d printing gurus who have been doing
this for years and they know what

280
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
this for years and they know what
 

281
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,870
this for years and they know what
they're doing and they're on youtube and

a lot of the upgrades that people were

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,590
a lot of the upgrades that people were

having to

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,950
having to
create for themselves okay so you get

create for themselves okay so you get
 

383
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,070
create for themselves okay so you get
a lot of the stuff out of the box that

a lot of the stuff out of the box that
 

385
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,150
a lot of the stuff out of the box that
otherwise um wouldn't have been an

otherwise um wouldn't have been an
 

387
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,670
otherwise um wouldn't have been an

older gen of of the ender three so

390
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
older gen of of the ender three so
 

391
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,909
older gen of of the ender three so
there's there's a lot of reasons to

there's there's a lot of reasons to
 

393
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,870
there's there's a lot of reasons to
choose this printer

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
i'm not saying this is the best printer
 

397
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,230
i'm not saying this is the best printer
by any stretch right but

by any stretch right but
 

399
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,550
by any stretch right but
as far as the economics of it go it's

as far as the economics of it go it's
 

401
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,710
as far as the economics of it go it's
really affordable and it does a great

you can see i've already been printing

408
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
you can see i've already been printing
 

409
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,589
you can see i've already been printing
stuff

410
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
stuff
 

411
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,749
stuff
and i'm just getting started yeah so

412
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
and i'm just getting started yeah so
 

413
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,189
and i'm just getting started yeah so
very clean prints

414
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
very clean prints
 

415
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,230
very clean prints
like that's one of the things with some

416
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
like that's one of the things with some
 

417
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,390
like that's one of the things with some
of the printers is you know you you read

418
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
of the printers is you know you you read
 

419
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,070
of the printers is you know you you read
reviews you look at the

420
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
reviews you look at the
 

421
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,309
reviews you look at the
the close-up photos and it's like wow

422
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
the close-up photos and it's like wow
 

423
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,070
the close-up photos and it's like wow
it's not really a smooth looking print

424
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
it's not really a smooth looking print
 

425
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,150
it's not really a smooth looking print
it's kind of clunky

426
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
it's kind of clunky
 

427
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,110
it's kind of clunky
these are really clean thanks jeff i'm a

428
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
these are really clean thanks jeff i'm a
 

429
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,749
these are really clean thanks jeff i'm a
noob

430
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
noob
 

431
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,230
noob
well done yeah all right so let's take a

432
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
well done yeah all right so let's take a
 

433
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,110
well done yeah all right so let's take a
look at how

434
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
look at how
 

435
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,309
look at how
i went about assembling the ender three

436
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
i went about assembling the ender three
 

437
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,990
i went about assembling the ender three
let's do that together

438
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000

 

439
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,710

the ender 3v2 comes partially assembled

440
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
the ender 3v2 comes partially assembled
 

441
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,270
the ender 3v2 comes partially assembled
the base

442
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
the base
 

443
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,430
the base
is assembled but we are going to need

444
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
is assembled but we are going to need
 

445
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,029
is assembled but we are going to need
the instruction manual

446
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
the instruction manual
 

447
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,230
the instruction manual
because we need to make sure that

448
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
because we need to make sure that
 

449
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,390
because we need to make sure that
everything goes together correctly there

450
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
everything goes together correctly there
 

451
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,710
everything goes together correctly there
is

452
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
is
 

453
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,990
is
some assembly required you should be

454
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
some assembly required you should be
 

455
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,029
some assembly required you should be
able to do this

456
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
able to do this
 

457
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,830
able to do this
reasonably easily especially if you

458
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
reasonably easily especially if you
 

459
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,950
reasonably easily especially if you
follow along

460
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
follow along
 

461
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,710
follow along
what's in the manual what you're going

462
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
what's in the manual what you're going
 

463
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,950
what's in the manual what you're going
to see here today

464
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960

 

465
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,230

let's start looking at the components

466
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
let's start looking at the components
 

467
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,390
let's start looking at the components
we've got the extruder kit here um this

468
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
we've got the extruder kit here um this
 

469
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,909
we've got the extruder kit here um this
is what the filament is going to

470
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
is what the filament is going to
 

471
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,589
is what the filament is going to
it's the hot end of the printer so this

472
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
it's the hot end of the printer so this
 

473
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,510
it's the hot end of the printer so this
what the filament is going to come out

474
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
what the filament is going to come out
 

475
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,710
what the filament is going to come out
of it's going to melt it

476
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
of it's going to melt it
 

477
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,390
of it's going to melt it
and move around on all the axes

478
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
and move around on all the axes
 

479
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,790
and move around on all the axes
then we've got the the screen here which

480
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
then we've got the the screen here which
 

481
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,550
then we've got the the screen here which
is an upgraded screen from

482
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
is an upgraded screen from
 

483
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,869
is an upgraded screen from
the previous iterations of the ender 3.

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,230
what else have we got here we've got
more extrusions uh for the frame

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,230
it's got some grease on it so
watch that's why it's got that sleeve

uh extrusion so i had to just simply

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,990
uh extrusion so i had to just simply
remove two screws and put it inside

remove two screws and put it inside

but you'll save a bit of time uh maybe
 

747
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,150
but you'll save a bit of time uh maybe
if you make a note of the position of

if you make a note of the position of
 

749
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,069
if you make a note of the position of
this it wasn't quite clear in the manual

750
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
this it wasn't quite clear in the manual
 

751
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,350
this it wasn't quite clear in the manual
and there were a couple of things like

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
and there were a couple of things like
 

753
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,150
and there were a couple of things like
that that

754
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
that that
 

755
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,870
that that
just weren't quite clear but easy enough

756
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
just weren't quite clear but easy enough
 

757
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,389
just weren't quite clear but easy enough
to figure out as long as you're patient

758
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
to figure out as long as you're patient

and
 

761
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,269
and
and uh take your time but uh i think now

762
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
and uh take your time but uh i think now
 

763
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,710
and uh take your time but uh i think now
that i've assembled it jeff

764
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
that i've assembled it jeff
 

765
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,389
that i've assembled it jeff
i could probably throw one of these

766
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
i could probably throw one of these
 

767
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,910
i could probably throw one of these
together in half the time

768
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
together in half the time
 

769
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,910
together in half the time
oh that's easily how long did it take

770
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
oh that's easily how long did it take
 

771
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,430
oh that's easily how long did it take
you to assemble this well

772
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
you to assemble this well
 

773
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,949
you to assemble this well
i mean i was shooting video and

774
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
i mean i was shooting video and
 

775
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,710
i mean i was shooting video and
everything so it's not really a fair

776
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
everything so it's not really a fair
 

777
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,110
everything so it's not really a fair
um equation right because you know i had

778
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
um equation right because you know i had
 

779
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,790
um equation right because you know i had
eight cameras around me and i'm setting

780
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
eight cameras around me and i'm setting
 

781
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,509
eight cameras around me and i'm setting
everything up and

782
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
everything up and
 

783
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,749
everything up and
and setting up my shots and things but

784
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
and setting up my shots and things but
 

785
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,670
and setting up my shots and things but
good for camera oh i got it uh

786
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
good for camera oh i got it uh
 

787
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,509
good for camera oh i got it uh
about an hour and a half it took me all

788
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
about an hour and a half it took me all
 

789
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,790
about an hour and a half it took me all
together so

790
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
together so
 

791
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,310
together so
i think you could probably put this

792
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
i think you could probably put this
 

793
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,990
i think you could probably put this
together in about a half hour

794
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
together in about a half hour
 

795
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,350
together in about a half hour
realistically pretty decent yeah yeah so

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
piece of paper and i'm going to be
 

813
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,389
piece of paper and i'm going to be
demonstrating how to do that there are

814
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
demonstrating how to do that there are
 

815
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,230
demonstrating how to do that there are
videos on youtube but we will make that

816
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
videos on youtube but we will make that
 

817
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,230
videos on youtube but we will make that
part of the series as well

818
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
part of the series as well
 

819
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,590
part of the series as well
leveling the bed is the first thing that

820
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
leveling the bed is the first thing that
 

821
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,269
leveling the bed is the first thing that
you need to do once it's level and

822
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
you need to do once it's level and
 

823
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,310
you need to do once it's level and
things look good

824
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
things look good
 

825
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,870
things look good
then you can start your 3d print so it

826
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
then you can start your 3d print so it
 

827
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,590
then you can start your 3d print so it
came with

828
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
came with
 

829
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,110
came with
an sd card as you noted there and

830
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
an sd card as you noted there and
 

831
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,230
an sd card as you noted there and
the sd card has some g-code models on it

832
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
the sd card has some g-code models on it
 

833
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,629
the sd card has some g-code models on it
so

834
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
so
 

835
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,430

g-code that was included on the sd card

856
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
g-code that was included on the sd card
 

857

working
the bed wasn't so because i'm starting

868
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
the bed wasn't so because i'm starting
 

869
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,590
the bed wasn't so because i'm starting
to

870
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
to
 

871
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,270
to
i'm starting to play around with my own

872
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
i'm starting to play around with my own
 

873
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,510
i'm starting to play around with my own
designs you mentioned these hooks we're

874
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
designs you mentioned these hooks we're
 

875
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,870
designs you mentioned these hooks we're
going to look at those

876
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
going to look at those
 

877
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,710
going to look at those
but so the hooks were going to be my

878
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
but so the hooks were going to be my
 

879
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,990
but so the hooks were going to be my
second print

880
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
second print
 

881
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,830
second print
okay i designed my own mask hooks

882
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
okay i designed my own mask hooks
 

883
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,590
okay i designed my own mask hooks
yes and these are these are meant to go

884
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
yes and these are these are meant to go
 

885
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:45,990
yes and these are these are meant to go
on

886
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
on
 

887
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,750
on
a half inch pipe so the cold water

888
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
a half inch pipe so the cold water
 

889
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,669
a half inch pipe so the cold water
pipe in our laundry room because we have

890
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
pipe in our laundry room because we have
 

891
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,110
pipe in our laundry room because we have
an unfinished laundry room

892
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
an unfinished laundry room
 

893
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,669
an unfinished laundry room
yeah this clips on to the half inch pipe

894
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
yeah this clips on to the half inch pipe
 

895
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,950
yeah this clips on to the half inch pipe
and it gives

896
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
and it gives
 

897
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,789
and it gives
us a place to dry our reusable washable

898
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
us a place to dry our reusable washable
 

899
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,510
us a place to dry our reusable washable
masks

900
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
masks
 

901
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,150
masks
are face masks so it's just a neat

902
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
are face masks so it's just a neat
 

903
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,549
are face masks so it's just a neat
little

904
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
little
 

905
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,710
little
thing that i came up with but my wife

906
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
thing that i came up with but my wife
 

907
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,549
thing that i came up with but my wife
was was thinking like hey this is really

908
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
was was thinking like hey this is really
 

909
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,430
was was thinking like hey this is really
really high

910
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
really high
 

911
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,909
really high
i can't quite reach it so the next

912
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
i can't quite reach it so the next
 

913
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,430
i can't quite reach it so the next
iteration was a little bit longer and a

914
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
iteration was a little bit longer and a
 

915
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,070
iteration was a little bit longer and a
little bit longer

916
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
little bit longer
 

917
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,110
little bit longer
and i went through a couple of

918
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
and i went through a couple of
 

919
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,110
and i went through a couple of
iterations so this was the the first one

920
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
iterations so this was the the first one
 

921
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,789
iterations so this was the the first one
was just this little tiny guy

922
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
was just this little tiny guy
 

923
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,950
was just this little tiny guy
yep right and then the next one was a

924
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
yep right and then the next one was a
 

925
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,390
yep right and then the next one was a
little bit longer and then

926
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
little bit longer and then
 

927
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,909
little bit longer and then
finally the final print

928
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
finally the final print
 

929
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,549
finally the final print
came out like this so i simply i simply

930
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
came out like this so i simply i simply
 

931
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,750
came out like this so i simply i simply
extended the uh

932
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
extended the uh
 

933
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,669
extended the uh
the length of it and i designed this in

934
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
the length of it and i designed this in
 

935
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,750
the length of it and i designed this in
a program called tinkercad which is a

printing

946
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
printing
 

947
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,990
printing
uh but that's what i use to design this

948
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
uh but that's what i use to design this
 

949
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,350
uh but that's what i use to design this
cool so i basically just

950
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
cool so i basically just
 

951
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,590
cool so i basically just
i laid it out in tinkercad and and

952
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
i laid it out in tinkercad and and
 

953
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,270
i laid it out in tinkercad and and
that's what i came up with

954
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
that's what i came up with
 

955
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,350
that's what i came up with
cool so and it printed great once i

956
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
cool so and it printed great once i
 

957
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,470
cool so and it printed great once i
figured it out but

958
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
figured it out but
 

959
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,070
figured it out but
day two came and nothing was working and

960
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
day two came and nothing was working and
 

961
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,510
day two came and nothing was working and
i say that

962
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
i say that
 

963
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,430
i say that
because i was struggling to get the bed

964
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
because i was struggling to get the bed
 

965
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,750
because i was struggling to get the bed
to level because nothing was sticking to

966
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
to level because nothing was sticking to
 

967
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,789
to level because nothing was sticking to
the bed

968
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
the bed
 

969
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,470
the bed
and it's really really important what i

970
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
and it's really really important what i
 

971
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,870
and it's really really important what i
found is it's very important that the

972
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
found is it's very important that the
 

973
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,710
found is it's very important that the
first couple of layers are stuck to the

974
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
first couple of layers are stuck to the
 

975
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,510
first couple of layers are stuck to the
bed

976
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
bed
 

977
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,150
bed
because if they're not as the printer is

978
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
because if they're not as the printer is
 

979
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,950
because if they're not as the printer is
moving up

980
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
moving up
 

981
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,110
moving up
it's gonna it's gonna lose adhesion and

982
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
it's gonna it's gonna lose adhesion and
 

983
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,310
it's gonna it's gonna lose adhesion and
it's gonna move

984
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
it's gonna move
 

985
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,070
it's gonna move
the the print is gonna move and then

986
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
the the print is gonna move and then
 

987
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,270
the the print is gonna move and then
it's not gonna be printing the right

988
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
it's not gonna be printing the right
 

989
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,630
it's not gonna be printing the right
thing in the right spot and it's not

990
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
thing in the right spot and it's not
 

991
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,789
thing in the right spot and it's not
gonna work out was the bed heating up

992
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
gonna work out was the bed heating up
 

993
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,470
gonna work out was the bed heating up
the bed was heating up to 60 degrees

994
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
the bed was heating up to 60 degrees
 

995
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,789
the bed was heating up to 60 degrees
celsius everything was working there

996
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
celsius everything was working there
 

997
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,990
celsius everything was working there
so i did everything from i gave it a

998
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,000
so i did everything from i gave it a
 

999
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,350
so i did everything from i gave it a
quick wipe down with some

1000
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
quick wipe down with some
 

1001
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,789
quick wipe down with some
isopropyl alcohol i upgraded the

1002
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
isopropyl alcohol i upgraded the
 

1003
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,710
isopropyl alcohol i upgraded the
firmware to one from filament friday

1004
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
firmware to one from filament friday
 

1005
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,750
firmware to one from filament friday
because it came with an

1006
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
because it came with an
 

1007
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,669
because it came with an
like the original firmware had some bugs

1008
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
like the original firmware had some bugs
 

1009
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,029
like the original firmware had some bugs
in it that he'd mentioned

1010
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
in it that he'd mentioned
 

1011
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,590
in it that he'd mentioned
and so i installed his firmware and it

1012
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
and so i installed his firmware and it
 

1013
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,470
and so i installed his firmware and it
still wasn't working for me yeah

1014
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
still wasn't working for me yeah
 

1015
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,870
still wasn't working for me yeah
and then i started thinking because you

1016
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
and then i started thinking because you
 

1017
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,750
and then i started thinking because you
know i'm i'm

1018
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
know i'm i'm
 

1019
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,990
know i'm i'm
the troubleshooter yes so i've tried

1020
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
the troubleshooter yes so i've tried
 

1021
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,310
the troubleshooter yes so i've tried
everything every time i leveled the bed

1022
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
everything every time i leveled the bed
 

1023
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,029
everything every time i leveled the bed
it still wasn't adhering to the bed so

1024
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,039
it still wasn't adhering to the bed so
 

1025
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,630
it still wasn't adhering to the bed so
then i started saying okay well what's

1026
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
then i started saying okay well what's
 

1027
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,310
then i started saying okay well what's
different between yesterday and today

1028
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,320
different between yesterday and today
 

1029
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,190
different between yesterday and today
and the one thing that i came up with is

1030
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
and the one thing that i came up with is
 

1031
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,990
and the one thing that i came up with is
our first day

1032
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
our first day
 

1033
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,350
our first day
print was from the g code provided by

1034
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
print was from the g code provided by
 

1035
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,350
print was from the g code provided by
creality yeah creality my second print

1036
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
creality yeah creality my second print
 

1037
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,909
creality yeah creality my second print
second day print was a g code that i

1038
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
second day print was a g code that i
 

1039
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,789
second day print was a g code that i
created

1040
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
created
 

1041
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,390
created
now understand so i've learned a couple

1042
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
now understand so i've learned a couple
 

1043
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,070
now understand so i've learned a couple
of things so i mentioned that i made

1044
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
of things so i mentioned that i made
 

1045
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,590
of things so i mentioned that i made
this in tinkercad i designed it in

1046
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
this in tinkercad i designed it in
 

1047
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,470
this in tinkercad i designed it in
tinkercad

1048
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
tinkercad
 

1049
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,430
tinkercad
but that gives you an stl file yes or an

1050
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
but that gives you an stl file yes or an
 

1051
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,190
but that gives you an stl file yes or an
obj or whatever so these are the file

1052
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
obj or whatever so these are the file
 

1053
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,149
obj or whatever so these are the file
extensions

1054
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
extensions
 

1055
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,630
extensions
so that stl file can't go to the printer

1056
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
so that stl file can't go to the printer
 

1057
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,870
so that stl file can't go to the printer
you need what's called a g-code which is

1058
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
you need what's called a g-code which is
 

1059
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,110
you need what's called a g-code which is
a file that tells it how to build the

1060
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
a file that tells it how to build the
 

1061
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,149
a file that tells it how to build the
layers okay

1062
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
layers okay
 

1063
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,390
layers okay
so that's i'm using a program called

1064
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
so that's i'm using a program called
 

1065
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,789
so that's i'm using a program called
cura which is also free

1066
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
cura which is also free
 

1067
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,270
cura which is also free

printing

1070
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
printing
 

1071
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,590
printing
and with that software it creates the

1072
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
and with that software it creates the
 

1073
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,070
and with that software it creates the
slice

1074
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
slice
 

1075
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,710
slice
layers yes and it spews out a file

1076
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
layers yes and it spews out a file
 

1077
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,710
layers yes and it spews out a file
called a g-code file

1078
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
called a g-code file
 

1079
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,230
called a g-code file
and so the g-code for this was on the sd

1080
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
and so the g-code for this was on the sd
 

1081
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,390
and so the g-code for this was on the sd
card came with it the g-code for this

1082
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
card came with it the g-code for this
 

1083
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,190
card came with it the g-code for this
is something that i made in cura okay so

1084
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
is something that i made in cura okay so
 

1085
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,710
is something that i made in cura okay so
then i started thinking okay well what's

1086
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
then i started thinking okay well what's
 

1087
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,390
then i started thinking okay well what's
different so

1088
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
different so
 

1089
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,950
different so
i got researching i got looking into it

1090
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
i got researching i got looking into it
 

1091
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,590
i got researching i got looking into it
and then

1092
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
and then
 

1093
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,830
and then
finally after several hours of tinkering

1094
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
finally after several hours of tinkering
 

1095
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,870
finally after several hours of tinkering
jeff i

1096

jeff i
 

1097
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,750
jeff i
found out that g-code is actually a text

1098
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
found out that g-code is actually a text
 

1099
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,470
found out that g-code is actually a text
file

1100
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
file
 

1101
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,990
file
a script oh so i opened it

1102
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
a script oh so i opened it
 

1103
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,350
a script oh so i opened it
in my text editor yep and looked at it

1104
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
in my text editor yep and looked at it
 

1105
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,390
in my text editor yep and looked at it
and i started seeing that this is just a

1106
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
and i started seeing that this is just a
 

1107
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,990
and i started seeing that this is just a
script it's like code

1108
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
script it's like code
 

1109
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,470
script it's like code
so then i looked at the code for this

1110
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
so then i looked at the code for this
 

1111
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,190
so then i looked at the code for this
one

1112
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
one
 

1113
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,190
one
and i looked at the code for mine and i

1114
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
and i looked at the code for mine and i
 

1115
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,549
and i looked at the code for mine and i
compared the difference

1116
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
compared the difference
 

1117
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,950
compared the difference
at the start of the file and found that

1118
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
at the start of the file and found that
 

1119
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,950
at the start of the file and found that
my g-code from cura

1120
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
my g-code from cura
 

1121
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,230
my g-code from cura
was telling the extruder to raise

1122
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
was telling the extruder to raise
 

1123
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,070
was telling the extruder to raise
two millimeters at the start of the

1124
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
two millimeters at the start of the
 

1125
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,990
two millimeters at the start of the
print and there was a comment that said

1126
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
print and there was a comment that said
 

1127
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,029
print and there was a comment that said
oh so that it doesn't scratch the print

1128
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
oh so that it doesn't scratch the print
 

1129
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,909
oh so that it doesn't scratch the print
bed

1130
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
bed
 

1131
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,669
bed
and it was raising a full two

1132
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
and it was raising a full two
 

1133
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,350
and it was raising a full two
millimeters so i started looking

1134
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
millimeters so i started looking
 

1135
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,950
millimeters so i started looking
so i started another print and i looked

1136
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
so i started another print and i looked
 

1137
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,950
so i started another print and i looked
down at the extruder and sure enough

1138
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
down at the extruder and sure enough
 

1139
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,549
down at the extruder and sure enough
at the beginning at the beginning of the

1140
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
at the beginning at the beginning of the
 

1141
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,710
at the beginning at the beginning of the
print i saw the extruder go up two

1142
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
print i saw the extruder go up two
 

1143
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,549
print i saw the extruder go up two
millimeters so it wasn't

1144
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
millimeters so it wasn't
 

1145
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,270
millimeters so it wasn't
quite down on the bed so it wasn't able

1146
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280
quite down on the bed so it wasn't able
 

1147
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,350
quite down on the bed so it wasn't able
to adhere to the bed so i went in

1148
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
to adhere to the bed so i went in
 

1149
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,830
to adhere to the bed so i went in
i copied the header from this g-code and

1150
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
i copied the header from this g-code and
 

1151
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,750
i copied the header from this g-code and
pasted it over top the header

1152
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
pasted it over top the header
 

1153
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,270
pasted it over top the header
of my g-code and i printed out a good 10

1154
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280
of my g-code and i printed out a good 10
 

1155
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,830
of my g-code and i printed out a good 10
15 of these hooks and it worked

1156
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
15 of these hooks and it worked
 

1157
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,789
15 of these hooks and it worked
perfectly

1158
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
perfectly
 

1159
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,110
perfectly
why the different header because you

1160
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
why the different header because you
 

1161
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,909
why the different header because you
didn't program that

1162
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
didn't program that
 

1163
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,230
didn't program that
different start code no it was just the

1164
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
different start code no it was just the
 

1165
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,830
different start code no it was just the
default profile

1166
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
default profile
 

1167
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,470
default profile
so it had this raise up two millimeters

1168
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
so it had this raise up two millimeters
 

1169
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,510
so it had this raise up two millimeters
or whatever so

1170
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
or whatever so
 

1171
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,549
or whatever so
so having replaced it with this header

1172
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
so having replaced it with this header
 

1173
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,029
so having replaced it with this header
the start code from this one everything

1174
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,039
the start code from this one everything
 

1175
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,390
the start code from this one everything
printed just fine

1176
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
printed just fine
 

1177
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,630
printed just fine
so i was like oh so that was a

1178
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
so i was like oh so that was a
 

1179
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,470
so i was like oh so that was a
revelation for me to realize that

1180
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
revelation for me to realize that
 

1181
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,510
revelation for me to realize that
the g code is an editable script that

1182
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
the g code is an editable script that
 

1183
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,270
the g code is an editable script that
you can go in and you can modify and

1184
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
you can go in and you can modify and
 

1185
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,390
you can go in and you can modify and
then i'm thinking about all the

1186
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
then i'm thinking about all the
 

1187
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,750
then i'm thinking about all the
wonderful things that you can do with

1188
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
wonderful things that you can do with
 

1189
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,710
wonderful things that you can do with
that knowledge

1190
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
that knowledge
 

1191
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,870
that knowledge
yeah and it's wonderful so then i took

1192
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
yeah and it's wonderful so then i took
 

1193
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,990
yeah and it's wonderful so then i took
that g code the

1194
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
that g code the
 

1195
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,470
that g code the
the start part of the g code and i

1196
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
the start part of the g code and i
 

1197
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,310
the start part of the g code and i
pasted it into my profile

1198
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
pasted it into my profile
 

1199
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,149
pasted it into my profile
in cura to always use that as my start

1200
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
in cura to always use that as my start
 

1201
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,029
in cura to always use that as my start
code that's

1202
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
code that's
 

1203
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,029
code that's
replacing the one that came with it i

1204
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
replacing the one that came with it i
 

1205
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,230
replacing the one that came with it i
made a couple of little mini

1206
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
made a couple of little mini
 

1207
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,990
made a couple of little mini
modifications based on the knowledge

1208
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
modifications based on the knowledge
 

1209
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,750
modifications based on the knowledge
that i had accumulated from

1210
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
that i had accumulated from
 

1211
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,310
that i had accumulated from
the research that i had done yeah and uh

1212
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
the research that i had done yeah and uh
 

1213
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,549
the research that i had done yeah and uh
now i've got a start code that is

1214
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
now i've got a start code that is
 

1215
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,590
now i've got a start code that is
working like that just beautiful so

1216
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
working like that just beautiful so
 

1217
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,669
working like that just beautiful so
every print comes out people would have

1218
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
every print comes out people would have
 

1219
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,070
every print comes out people would have
run into that issue and would have said

1220
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
run into that issue and would have said
 

1221
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,149
run into that issue and would have said
the machine's just not working nobody

1222
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
the machine's just not working nobody
 

1223
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,390
the machine's just not working nobody
was saying check the start code on your

1224
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
was saying check the start code on your
 

1225
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,430
was saying check the start code on your
g-code

1226
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
g-code
 

1227
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,950
g-code
everybody was saying okay make sure your

1228
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
everybody was saying okay make sure your
 

1229
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,630
everybody was saying okay make sure your
bed is level yeah i did that

1230
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
bed is level yeah i did that
 

1231
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,029
bed is level yeah i did that
10 times make sure that the bed is clean

1232
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
10 times make sure that the bed is clean
 

1233
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,990
10 times make sure that the bed is clean
yeah i did that

1234
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
yeah i did that
 

1235
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,669
yeah i did that
make sure you know that there's no

1236
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
make sure you know that there's no
 

1237
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,510
make sure you know that there's no
interesting yeah so all this stuff make

1238
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
interesting yeah so all this stuff make
 

1239
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,029
interesting yeah so all this stuff make
sure the bed temperature is good

1240
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
sure the bed temperature is good
 

1241
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,750
sure the bed temperature is good
uh the g code from cura was defaulting

1242
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
uh the g code from cura was defaulting
 

1243
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,350
uh the g code from cura was defaulting
to 50 degrees celsius

1244
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
to 50 degrees celsius
 

1245
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,110
to 50 degrees celsius
i noticed that this one was 60 degrees

1246
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
i noticed that this one was 60 degrees
 

1247
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,110
i noticed that this one was 60 degrees
celsius so i increased it

1248
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
celsius so i increased it
 

1249
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,029
celsius so i increased it
yeah and that was done through the

1250
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
yeah and that was done through the
 

1251
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,230
yeah and that was done through the
material

1252
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
material
 

1253
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,230
material
in cura again i'm going to show you how

1254
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
in cura again i'm going to show you how
 

1255
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,230
in cura again i'm going to show you how
to do all these things so don't worry

1256
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
to do all these things so don't worry
 

1257
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,630
to do all these things so don't worry
okay but that's what i learned so then

1258
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:52,640
okay but that's what i learned so then
 

1259
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,470
okay but that's what i learned so then
we started printing other things and

1260
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
we started printing other things and
 

1261
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,029
we started printing other things and
my other son zach said i really want a

1262
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
my other son zach said i really want a
 

1263
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,669
my other son zach said i really want a
dalek

1264
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
dalek
 

1265
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,110
dalek
yes and so we got onto thingiverse and

1266
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
yes and so we got onto thingiverse and
 

1267
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,390
yes and so we got onto thingiverse and
downloaded the stl file for a dalek

1268
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
downloaded the stl file for a dalek
 

1269
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,830
downloaded the stl file for a dalek
now that is not monochromatic that's

1270
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
now that is not monochromatic that's
 

1271
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,750
now that is not monochromatic that's
got two colors you're right so what we

1272
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
got two colors you're right so what we
 

1273
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,870
got two colors you're right so what we
actually did is we

1274
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
actually did is we
 

1275
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,230
actually did is we
first printed these parts okay

1276
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
first printed these parts okay
 

1277
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,029
first printed these parts okay
okay so these little guys the extensions

1278
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
okay so these little guys the extensions
 

1279
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,310
okay so these little guys the extensions
and these actually clip

1280
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
and these actually clip
 

1281
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,590
and these actually clip
into the daleks so we printed it in two

1282
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
into the daleks so we printed it in two
 

1283
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,390
into the daleks so we printed it in two
parts

1284
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
parts
 

1285
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,350
parts
very cool yeah um you'll see that these

1286
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
very cool yeah um you'll see that these
 

1287
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,549
very cool yeah um you'll see that these
are all white

1288
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
are all white
 

1289
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,350
are all white
yes they are all printed jeff with that

1290
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
yes they are all printed jeff with that
 

1291
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,710
yes they are all printed jeff with that
sample spool

1292
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720

so speaking of wanting to um
 

1335
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,590
so speaking of wanting to um
basically adapt our designs to

1336
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
basically adapt our designs to
 

1337
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,590
basically adapt our designs to
our own needs so creating attachments

1338
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
our own needs so creating attachments
 

1339
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,710
our own needs so creating attachments
and things like that

it's quiet it's got the quiet circuit

1436
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840
it's quiet it's got the quiet circuit
 

1437
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,590
it's quiet it's got the quiet circuit
the the board itself is like

1438

the the board itself is like
 

1439
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,710
the the board itself is like
i don't know it's upgraded on the uh v2

1440
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
i don't know it's upgraded on the uh v2
 

1441

um and apparently is quieter than the
 

1443
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,750
um and apparently is quieter than the
older versions we're going to be looking

1444
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
older versions we're going to be looking
 

1445
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,630
older versions we're going to be looking
at the actual

1446
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
at the actual
 

1447
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,710
at the actual
sound that it generates but you hear the

1448
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720

there is the cooling system to keep
 

1453
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,110
there is the cooling system to keep
things cool yep um

1454
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
things cool yep um
 

1455
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,510
things cool yep um

but uh it's reasonably quiet like we
 

1457
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,950
but uh it's reasonably quiet like we
could have it running right here and

could have it running right here and
 

1459
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,710
could have it running right here and
it wouldn't uh it wouldn't probably even

it wouldn't uh it wouldn't probably even
 

1461
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,669
it wouldn't uh it wouldn't probably even

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
like 200
 

1495
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,990

kilobytes and things like that but as

1496

kilobytes and things like that but as
 

1497
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,190
kilobytes and things like that but as
soon as i got into some more

1498
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
soon as i got into some more
 

1499
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,710

i was like oh wow this is this is 26

1502
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
i was like oh wow this is this is 26

1505
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,470
megabytes and i can't edit it
in tinkercad so that will eventually

1506
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
in tinkercad so that will eventually
 

1507
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,990
in tinkercad so that will eventually
lead me to start looking at other things

1508
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
lead me to start looking at other things
 

1509
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,750
lead me to start looking at other things
but i think tinkercad is a really good

1510

currently have so maybe setting the
 

1927
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,829
currently have so maybe setting the
expectations

1928
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
expectations
 

1929
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,230
expectations
low in that you know those of us who

1930
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,240
low in that you know those of us who
 

1931
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,589
low in that you know those of us who
have gig internet

1932
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
have gig internet
 

1933
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,069
have gig internet
aren't going out and and signing up for

1934
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
aren't going out and and signing up for
 

1935
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:24,790
aren't going out and and signing up for
the new

1936
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:24,800
the new
 

1937
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,150
the new
you know this is the latest and greatest

1938
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
you know this is the latest and greatest
 

1939
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,829
you know this is the latest and greatest
from spacex right so

1940
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:27,839
from spacex right so
 

1941
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,990
from spacex right so
it's going to be the best well they're

1942
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
it's going to be the best well they're
 

1943
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,670
it's going to be the best well they're
setting the expectations low

1944
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
setting the expectations low
 

1945
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,349
setting the expectations low
purposefully so that it's the right

1946
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:33,359
purposefully so that it's the right
 

1947
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,270
purposefully so that it's the right
market yeah i i guess

1948
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
market yeah i i guess
 

1949
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,870
market yeah i i guess
if you're in a city where you've got

1950
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
if you're in a city where you've got
 

1951
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,349
if you're in a city where you've got
that high speed but if you have nothing

1952
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
that high speed but if you have nothing
 

1953
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,950
that high speed but if you have nothing
yes i mean what they're offering for

1954
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
yes i mean what they're offering for
 

1955
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,710
yes i mean what they're offering for
speeds is phenomenal it is

1956
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
speeds is phenomenal it is
 

1957
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,430
speeds is phenomenal it is
so i mean i'm i'm excited at first i

1958
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,440
so i mean i'm i'm excited at first i
 

1959
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,030
so i mean i'm i'm excited at first i
wasn't sure how i felt about this

1960
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
wasn't sure how i felt about this
 

1961
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,310
wasn't sure how i felt about this
project when i first heard about it

1962
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,320
project when i first heard about it
 

1963
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,270
project when i first heard about it
because i'm like oh

1964
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
because i'm like oh
 

1965
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,630
because i'm like oh
he just wants to space debris yeah

1966
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
he just wants to space debris yeah
 

1967
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,550
he just wants to space debris yeah
but now that i'm starting to see it roll

1968
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
but now that i'm starting to see it roll
 

1969
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,829
but now that i'm starting to see it roll
out

1970
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:55,839
out
 

1971
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,270
out
i'm getting excited about but what's

1972
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
i'm getting excited about but what's
 

1973
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,349
i'm getting excited about but what's
interesting is that it's upper u.s

1974
00:35:59,349 --> 00:35:59,359
interesting is that it's upper u.s
 

1975
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,829
interesting is that it's upper u.s
possibly lower canada for their base

1976
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:01,839
possibly lower canada for their base
 

1977
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,870
possibly lower canada for their base
start

1978
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
start
 

1979
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,910
start
why not beta test in like a low like

1980
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
why not beta test in like a low like
 

1981
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,910
why not beta test in like a low like
pick somewhere along the equator of

1982
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
pick somewhere along the equator of
 

1983
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,270
pick somewhere along the equator of
africa maybe

1984
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
africa maybe
 

1985
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,190
africa maybe
you know like some remote well it makes

1986
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,200
you know like some remote well it makes
 

1987
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,790
you know like some remote well it makes
sense though that they would want to

1988
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
sense though that they would want to
 

1989
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,670
sense though that they would want to
test it in a place where well think of

1990
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
test it in a place where well think of
 

1991
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,710
test it in a place where well think of
it this way

1992
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
it this way
 

1993
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,270
it this way
if if it went down i have something else

1994
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
if if it went down i have something else
 

1995
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,390
if if it went down i have something else
to fall back on

1996
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
to fall back on
 

1997
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,230
to fall back on
yeah i have the 4g infrastructure to

1998
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,240
yeah i have the 4g infrastructure to
 

1999
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,069
yeah i have the 4g infrastructure to
fall back on if i needed to

2000
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:24,079
fall back on if i needed to
 

2001
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,910
fall back on if i needed to
so maybe that has something to do with

2002
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
so maybe that has something to do with
 

2003
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,310
so maybe that has something to do with
it i mean we're speculating here but

2004
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320
it i mean we're speculating here but
 

2005
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,390
it i mean we're speculating here but
there there are so many thoughts yeah

2006
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
there there are so many thoughts yeah
 

2007
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,510
there there are so many thoughts yeah
but hey how

2008
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
but hey how
 

2009
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,069
but hey how
how does something like starlink affect

2010
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
how does something like starlink affect
 

2011
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,510
how does something like starlink affect
you is it something that would be better

2012
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
you is it something that would be better
 

2013
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,190
you is it something that would be better
than what you have or is it

2014
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,200
than what you have or is it
 

2015
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,910
than what you have or is it
a severe downgrade that's really what it

2016
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:39,920
a severe downgrade that's really what it
 

2017
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,670
a severe downgrade that's really what it
comes down to but i think in a lot of

2018
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,680
comes down to but i think in a lot of
 

2019
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,670
comes down to but i think in a lot of
cases this is going to bring

2020
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
cases this is going to bring
 

2021
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,109
cases this is going to bring
high-speed internet to areas that

2022
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
high-speed internet to areas that
 

2023
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,630
high-speed internet to areas that
currently don't have it and not only

2024
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
currently don't have it and not only
 

2025
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,030
currently don't have it and not only
that

2026
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
that
 

2027
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,190
that
jeff but we've hit on it in the past

2028
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
jeff but we've hit on it in the past
 

2029
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,109
jeff but we've hit on it in the past
when we've talked about starlink

2030
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
when we've talked about starlink
 

2031
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,829
when we've talked about starlink
and that's that in an event of natural

2032
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:53,839
and that's that in an event of natural
 

2033
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,630
and that's that in an event of natural
disaster

2034
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:54,640
disaster
 

2035
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,829
disaster
or infrastructure um issues

2036
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:57,839
or infrastructure um issues
 

2037
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,550
or infrastructure um issues
it's an opportunity to still receive

2038
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:00,560
it's an opportunity to still receive
 

2039
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,829
it's an opportunity to still receive
good solid internet

2040
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:01,839
good solid internet
 

2041
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,109
good solid internet
high-speed internet that is not reliant

2042
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
high-speed internet that is not reliant
 

2043
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,069
high-speed internet that is not reliant
on things like

2044
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
on things like
 

2045
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,109
on things like
towers yes right now one of the things

2046
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
towers yes right now one of the things
 

2047
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,630
towers yes right now one of the things
that will be interesting is because

2048
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
that will be interesting is because
 

2049
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,790
that will be interesting is because
i mean this is not new like satellite

2050
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
i mean this is not new like satellite
 

2051
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,670
i mean this is not new like satellite
internet

2052
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:13,680
internet
 

2053
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,910
internet
is already well good satellite internet

2054
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
is already well good satellite internet
 

2055
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,190
is already well good satellite internet
what's new that's

2056
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200
what's new that's
 

2057
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,230
what's new that's
that's the challenge here is uh i mean i

2058
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
that's the challenge here is uh i mean i
 

2059
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,430
that's the challenge here is uh i mean i
used to

2060
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,440
used to
 

2061
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,069
used to
another iteration of my working life i

2062
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,079
another iteration of my working life i
 

2063
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:24,710
another iteration of my working life i
was a

2064
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:24,720
was a
 

2065
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,030
was a
uh a ser recognized installer for

2066
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
uh a ser recognized installer for
 

2067
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,470
uh a ser recognized installer for
satellite internet

2068
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
satellite internet
 

2069
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,589
satellite internet
um so i have an inner working of or an

2070
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:31,599
um so i have an inner working of or an
 

2071
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,589
um so i have an inner working of or an
inner understanding of how it works and

2072
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:33,599
inner understanding of how it works and
 

2073
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,190
inner understanding of how it works and
it was quite

2074
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
it was quite
 

2075
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,390
it was quite
uh cumbersome and unreliable

2076
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
uh cumbersome and unreliable
 

2077
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,630
uh cumbersome and unreliable
yep i mean the dish moves just a slight

2078
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
yep i mean the dish moves just a slight
 

2079
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,910
yep i mean the dish moves just a slight
bit from wind right

2080
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
bit from wind right
 

2081
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,310
bit from wind right
and you're out so i'm really interested

2082
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
and you're out so i'm really interested
 

2083
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,750
and you're out so i'm really interested
to see

2084
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
to see
 

2085
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,950
to see
how starlink's internet

2086
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960

words
 

2579
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,109
words
and so out of a repository uh the system

2580
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:43,119
and so out of a repository uh the system
 

2581
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,829
and so out of a repository uh the system
generated 24 words

2582
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
generated 24 words
 

2583
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,150
generated 24 words
and that those are the words that you

2584
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,160
and that those are the words that you
 

2585
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,270
and that those are the words that you
need to remember

2586
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,280
need to remember
 

2587
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,829
need to remember
uh when you generate a wallet for

2588
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:51,839
uh when you generate a wallet for
 

2589
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:52,790
uh when you generate a wallet for
example you

2590
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:52,800
example you
 

2591
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,990
example you
create a new wallet uh well it will uh

2592
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
create a new wallet uh well it will uh
 

2593
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,630
create a new wallet uh well it will uh
generate those 24 words and those are

2594
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
generate those 24 words and those are
 

2595
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,910
generate those 24 words and those are
the ones that you have to remember

2596
00:46:59,910 --> 00:46:59,920
the ones that you have to remember
 

2597
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,109
the ones that you have to remember
because everything

2598
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
because everything
 

2599
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,150
because everything
derives from those 24 words so

2600
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:04,160
derives from those 24 words so
 

2601
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,069
derives from those 24 words so
with a little bit this little bit

2602
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:06,079
with a little bit this little bit
 

2603
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,109
with a little bit this little bit
technical here but from those 24 words

2604
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119
technical here but from those 24 words
 

2605
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,430
technical here but from those 24 words
we deduct the private key from that

2606
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,440
we deduct the private key from that
 

2607
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,430
we deduct the private key from that
private key we deduct the public key and

2608
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
private key we deduct the public key and
 

2609
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,270
private key we deduct the public key and
that public key and then generates the

2610
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
that public key and then generates the
 

2611
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,309
that public key and then generates the
address

2612
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
address
 

2613
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,030
address
yeah so and the reason that is done is

2614
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:19,040
yeah so and the reason that is done is
 

2615
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,790
yeah so and the reason that is done is
that there is no way in the world that

2616
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
that there is no way in the world that
 

2617
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,309
that there is no way in the world that
you can get back to the private key

2618
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
you can get back to the private key
 

2619
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,750
you can get back to the private key
that's why

2620
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
that's why
 

2621
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,710
that's why
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so

2622
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,720
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so
 

2623
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,390
cryptocurrency is so secure yeah and so
what you do is you take the private key

2624
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,400
what you do is you take the private key
 

2625
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,630
what you do is you take the private key
you hash it that's a special

2626
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
you hash it that's a special
 

2627
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,829
you hash it that's a special
crypto cryptographic process and with

2628
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
crypto cryptographic process and with
 

2629
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,829
crypto cryptographic process and with
that you generate the public key

2630
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:35,839
that you generate the public key
 

2631
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,750
that you generate the public key
and the public key is hashed twice and

2632
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
and the public key is hashed twice and
 

2633
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,270
and the public key is hashed twice and
that generates the address

2634
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280
that generates the address
 

2635
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,510
that generates the address
the reason that this is done is that

2636
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:41,520
the reason that this is done is that
 

2637
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,150
the reason that this is done is that
there might be future some computers

2638
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
there might be future some computers
 

2639
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,349
there might be future some computers
that are able to deduct from the public

2640
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
that are able to deduct from the public
 

2641
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,549
that are able to deduct from the public
key the private key

2642
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:48,559
key the private key
 

2643
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,829
key the private key
they don't exist yet but we're thinking

2644
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:51,839
they don't exist yet but we're thinking
 

2645
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,230
they don't exist yet but we're thinking
well ahead in the future and that's why

2646
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,240
well ahead in the future and that's why
 

2647
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,190
well ahead in the future and that's why
we are using the address as the key that

2648
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
we are using the address as the key that
 

2649
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,670
we are using the address as the key that
you

2650
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:57,680
you
 

2651
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,870
you
uh send to other people in case you want

2652
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880
uh send to other people in case you want
 

2653
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,790
uh send to other people in case you want
to resee some bitcoin or so

2654
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:02,800
to resee some bitcoin or so
 

2655
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,990
to resee some bitcoin or so
so this is all the magic behind

2656
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
so this is all the magic behind
 

2657
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,510
so this is all the magic behind
it it's based on those 24 words those 24

2658
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:09,520
it it's based on those 24 words those 24
 

2659
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,430
it it's based on those 24 words those 24
words generate the private key the

2660
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:11,440
words generate the private key the
 

2661
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,510
words generate the private key the
private key generates the public key and

2662
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:13,520
private key generates the public key and
 

2663
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,430
private key generates the public key and
the public key generates the address and

2664
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440
the public key generates the address and
 

2665
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,270
the public key generates the address and
address is what we use

2666
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
address is what we use
 

2667
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,349
address is what we use
and that set is used in many other

2668
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
and that set is used in many other
 

2669
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,430
and that set is used in many other
ikea cryptocurrencies they use the same

2670
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
ikea cryptocurrencies they use the same
 

2671
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,870
