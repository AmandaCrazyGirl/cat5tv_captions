00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
that into a 3d
 

325
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,110
that into a 3d
image or in this case 3d model with that

326
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
image or in this case 3d model with that
 

327
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,629
image or in this case 3d model with that
being said we're going to take it one

328
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
being said we're going to take it one
 

329
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,670
being said we're going to take it one
step further

330
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
step further
 

331
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,430
step further
and we're going to take that 3d model

332
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
and we're going to take that 3d model
 

333
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,870
and we're going to take that 3d model
and 3d print it

334
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
and 3d print it
 

335
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,029
and 3d print it
so then you have your house in the palm

336
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
so then you have your house in the palm
 

337
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,230
so then you have your house in the palm
of your hand

338
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
of your hand
 

339
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,950
of your hand
what use is this i'm glad you asked an

340
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
what use is this i'm glad you asked an
 

341
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,870
what use is this i'm glad you asked an
example of what this can be used for

342
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
example of what this can be used for
 

343
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,710
example of what this can be used for
is if you're a real estate agent and

344
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
is if you're a real estate agent and
 

345
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,070
is if you're a real estate agent and
you're trying to sell a house but

346
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
you're trying to sell a house but
 

347
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,830
you're trying to sell a house but
somebody has a hard time seeing they

348
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
somebody has a hard time seeing they
 

349
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,430
somebody has a hard time seeing they
could be blind

350
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
could be blind
 

351
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,070
could be blind
etc what you can do is that you can 3d

352
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
etc what you can do is that you can 3d
 

353
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,749
etc what you can do is that you can 3d
scan the property

354
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
scan the property
 

355
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,990
scan the property
3d print that property and then they can

356
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
3d print that property and then they can
 

357
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,670
3d print that property and then they can
actually feel the house with their very

358
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
actually feel the house with their very
 

359
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,390
actually feel the house with their very
own hands

360
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
own hands
 

361
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,189
own hands
how cool is that now stay tuned for this

362
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
how cool is that now stay tuned for this
 

363
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,350
how cool is that now stay tuned for this
exciting segment as we go over how to

364
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
exciting segment as we go over how to
 

365
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,550
exciting segment as we go over how to
3d print as well as 3d capture using

366
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
3d print as well as 3d capture using
 

367
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,830
3d print as well as 3d capture using
photogrammetry

368
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
photogrammetry
 

369
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:10,270
photogrammetry
let's take a look

370
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,280

 

371
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,710

[Applause]

372
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
[Applause]
 

373
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:45,430
[Applause]
[Music]

374
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
[Music]
 

375
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,189
[Music]
so now that our drone's safely back on

376
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
so now that our drone's safely back on
 

377
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,950
so now that our drone's safely back on
the ground what we can do is head back

378
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
the ground what we can do is head back
 

379
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,150
the ground what we can do is head back
to the studio

380
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
to the studio
 

381
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,469
to the studio
upload these images to the cloud to the

382
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
upload these images to the cloud to the
 

383
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,430
upload these images to the cloud to the
software

384
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
software
 

385
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,029
software
that will then stitch it all together

386
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
that will then stitch it all together
 

387
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,710
that will then stitch it all together
into our 3d model

388
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
into our 3d model
 

389
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,790
into our 3d model
so that's pretty cool let's go take a

390
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
so that's pretty cool let's go take a
 

391
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,990
so that's pretty cool let's go take a
look at that

392
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
look at that
 

393
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,350
look at that
let's go all right now we're back in the

394
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
let's go all right now we're back in the
 

395
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,230
let's go all right now we're back in the
studio here

396
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
studio here
 

397
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,749
studio here
um i know this is a different building

398
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
um i know this is a different building
 

399
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,510
um i know this is a different building
than we used before but this one's a

400
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
than we used before but this one's a
 

401
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,189
than we used before but this one's a
really nice example so we're going to

402
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
really nice example so we're going to
 

403
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,230
really nice example so we're going to
use this uh

404
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
use this uh
 

405
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,909
use this uh
provided example here so let's pretend

406
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
provided example here so let's pretend
 

407
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,070
provided example here so let's pretend
we're we've finished flying we did our

408
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
we're we've finished flying we did our
 

409
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,790
we're we've finished flying we did our
little grid pattern or whatever we flew

410
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
little grid pattern or whatever we flew
 

411
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,909
little grid pattern or whatever we flew
now we upload our photos to

412
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
now we upload our photos to
 

413
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,749
now we upload our photos to
your provider in this case it's drone

414
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
your provider in this case it's drone
 

415
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,749
your provider in this case it's drone
deploy but it could be pix4d

416
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
deploy but it could be pix4d
 

417
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,029
deploy but it could be pix4d
or dji um and then after

418
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
or dji um and then after
 

419
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,510
or dji um and then after
it processes you get something cool

420
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
it processes you get something cool
 

421
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,710
it processes you get something cool
looking like this

422
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
looking like this
 

423
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,150
looking like this
so again we have our ortho mosaic

424
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
so again we have our ortho mosaic
 

425
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,230
so again we have our ortho mosaic
so it's like a giant 2d map so kind of

426
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
so it's like a giant 2d map so kind of
 

427
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,790
so it's like a giant 2d map so kind of
imagine this as a more high definition

428
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
imagine this as a more high definition
 

429
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,830
imagine this as a more high definition
google maps or

430
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
google maps or
 

431
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,350
google maps or
satellite image right so this image here

432
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
satellite image right so this image here
 

433
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,629
satellite image right so this image here
that you can see on this overlaid map

434
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
that you can see on this overlaid map
 

435
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,469
that you can see on this overlaid map
this is made of hundreds of images

436
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
this is made of hundreds of images
 

437
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,909
this is made of hundreds of images
stitched together

438
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
stitched together
 

439
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,830
stitched together
to make make it look like it's a

440
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
to make make it look like it's a
 

441
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,990
to make make it look like it's a
satellite image which is really really

442
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
satellite image which is really really
 

443
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,869
satellite image which is really really
cool it's a really cool program but of

444
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
cool it's a really cool program but of
 

445
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,510
cool it's a really cool program but of
course with this since there's gps data

446
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
course with this since there's gps data
 

447
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,950
course with this since there's gps data
within the files so again we have our

448
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
within the files so again we have our
 

449
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,589
within the files so again we have our
geolocation data

450
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
geolocation data
 

451
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,909
geolocation data
we can do cool things such as measure

452
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
we can do cool things such as measure
 

453
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,710
we can do cool things such as measure
distances

454
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
distances
 

455
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,589
distances
we can do different spot heights we can

456
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
we can do different spot heights we can
 

457
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,270
we can do different spot heights we can
do different locations you can pin

458
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
do different locations you can pin
 

459
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,909
do different locations you can pin
things

460
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
things
 

461
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,629
things
but this isn't just everything i'm going

462
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
but this isn't just everything i'm going
 

463
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,589
but this isn't just everything i'm going
to show you right now

464
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
to show you right now
 

465
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,189
to show you right now
no what we really want is this

466
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
no what we really want is this
 

467
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,070
no what we really want is this
and that is the 3d model of the

468
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
and that is the 3d model of the
 

469
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,029
and that is the 3d model of the
environment

470
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
environment
 

471
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,550
environment
all right this is what we're looking for

472
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
all right this is what we're looking for
 

473
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,709
all right this is what we're looking for
this is the cool

474
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
this is the cool
 

475
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,990
this is the cool
looking 3d map the 3d

476
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
looking 3d map the 3d
 

477
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,350
looking 3d map the 3d
model that we have been able to create

478
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
model that we have been able to create
 

479
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,230
model that we have been able to create
using our images that we've uploaded to

480
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
using our images that we've uploaded to
 

481
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,670
using our images that we've uploaded to
our program

482
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
our program
 

483
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,590
our program
so pretty much again we take our photos

484
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
so pretty much again we take our photos
 

485
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,829
so pretty much again we take our photos
the program stitches everything together

486
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
the program stitches everything together
 

487
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,350
the program stitches everything together
and it's able to create this

488
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
and it's able to create this
 

489
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,509
and it's able to create this
cool 3d file this 3d model

490
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
cool 3d file this 3d model
 

491
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,230
cool 3d file this 3d model
photogrammetry really is the future and

492
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
photogrammetry really is the future and
 

493
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,230
photogrammetry really is the future and
again it's not perfect like again going

494
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
again it's not perfect like again going
 

495
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,470
again it's not perfect like again going
closer into things we do have like a few

496
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
closer into things we do have like a few
 

497
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,550
closer into things we do have like a few
little weird nubs and a few little uh

498
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
little weird nubs and a few little uh
 

499
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,430
little weird nubs and a few little uh
errors

500
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
errors
 

501
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,949
errors
but again you can correct those in

502
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
but again you can correct those in
 

503
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,870
but again you can correct those in
blender or if you

504
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
blender or if you
 

505
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,949
blender or if you
pretty much the more advanced drone you

506
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
pretty much the more advanced drone you
 

507
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,430
pretty much the more advanced drone you
have also known as the better camera

508
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
have also known as the better camera
 

509
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,310
have also known as the better camera
if you have fleur or lidar or anything

510
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
if you have fleur or lidar or anything
 

511
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,190
if you have fleur or lidar or anything
that makes

512
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
that makes
 

513
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,509
that makes
a much better high resolution image a

514
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
a much better high resolution image a
 

515
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,870
a much better high resolution image a
more accurate image

516
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
more accurate image
 

517
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,110
more accurate image
but again today we're just using uh

518
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
but again today we're just using uh
 

519
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,110
but again today we're just using uh
standard off the uh

520
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
standard off the uh
 

521
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,509
standard off the uh
off-the-shelf drone so hey that that

522
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
off-the-shelf drone so hey that that
 

523
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,350
off-the-shelf drone so hey that that
that's still a pretty nice those are

524
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
that's still a pretty nice those are
 

525
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,269
that's still a pretty nice those are
some really sharp looking lines

526
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
some really sharp looking lines
 

527
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,949
some really sharp looking lines
so now what we can do is that we can

528
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
so now what we can do is that we can
 

529
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,030
so now what we can do is that we can
actually download this map

530
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
actually download this map
 

531
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,269
actually download this map
depending what program you're using and

532
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
depending what program you're using and
 

533
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,949
depending what program you're using and
we can

534
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
we can
 

535
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,670
we can
export this as an obj file or another

536
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
export this as an obj file or another
 

537
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,550
export this as an obj file or another
readable

538
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
readable
 

539
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,630
readable
3d file format and we can actually

540
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
3d file format and we can actually
 

541
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,110
3d file format and we can actually
import this into a 3d printer

542
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
import this into a 3d printer
 

543
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,430
import this into a 3d printer
so let's take a look at some images that

544
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
so let's take a look at some images that
 

545
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,870
so let's take a look at some images that
robbie gave us

546
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
robbie gave us
 

547
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,190
robbie gave us
of him converting one of my files i did

548
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
of him converting one of my files i did
 

549
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,230
of him converting one of my files i did
into a 3d model

550
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
into a 3d model
 

551
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,150
into a 3d model
all right so before we turn into a 3d

552
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
all right so before we turn into a 3d
 

553
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,910
all right so before we turn into a 3d
model i just wanted to show

554
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
model i just wanted to show
 

555
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,230
model i just wanted to show
what model i gave robbie so this is a

556
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
what model i gave robbie so this is a
 

557
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,910
what model i gave robbie so this is a
house we shot a few years ago you can

558
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
house we shot a few years ago you can
 

559
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,470
house we shot a few years ago you can

that's my company

564
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
that's my company
 

565
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,190
that's my company
um but as you can see it's a really nice

566
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
um but as you can see it's a really nice
 

567
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,269
um but as you can see it's a really nice
looking home you know the resolution

568
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
looking home you know the resolution
 

569
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,030
looking home you know the resolution
is actually not that bad this was shot

570
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
is actually not that bad this was shot
 

571
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,430
is actually not that bad this was shot
with a phantom 3 professional

572
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
with a phantom 3 professional
 

573
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,350
with a phantom 3 professional
um again there are a few errors like

574
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
um again there are a few errors like
 

575
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,550
um again there are a few errors like
this section right here

576
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
this section right here
 

577
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,310
this section right here
so this is there was a tree right here

578
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
so this is there was a tree right here
 

579
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,230
so this is there was a tree right here
so we weren't able to get proper

580
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
so we weren't able to get proper
 

581
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,550
so we weren't able to get proper
photos that's why the program kind of

582
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
photos that's why the program kind of
 

583
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,389
photos that's why the program kind of
freaked out in this corner here

584
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
freaked out in this corner here
 

585
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,550
freaked out in this corner here
but everything else is pretty uh it did

586
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
but everything else is pretty uh it did
 

587
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,509
but everything else is pretty uh it did
a really nice job

588
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
a really nice job
 

589
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,230
a really nice job
and again the uh algorithms have become

590
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
and again the uh algorithms have become
 

591
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,150
and again the uh algorithms have become
a lot more accurate

592
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
a lot more accurate
 

593
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,230
a lot more accurate
uh these past few years so chances are

594
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
uh these past few years so chances are
 

595
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,509
uh these past few years so chances are
if we did this again it would be a lot

596
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
if we did this again it would be a lot
 

597
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,389
if we did this again it would be a lot
more accurate

598
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
more accurate
 

599
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,230
more accurate
even if we still use the phantom 3

600
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
even if we still use the phantom 3
 

601
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,230
even if we still use the phantom 3
camera and of course you can add other

just in blender or other programs so

606
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
just in blender or other programs so
 

607
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,750
just in blender or other programs so
let's see how

608
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
let's see how
 

609
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,110
let's see how
robbie's program takes this dot obj file

610

keep in mind henry was looking at a
 

653
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,389
keep in mind henry was looking at a
textured file so it had like the

654
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
textured file so it had like the
 

655
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,470
textured file so it had like the
the brick overlay and everything all the

00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
coloring and all that stuff
 

659
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,790
coloring and all that stuff
what we're about to see is just the obj

660
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
what we're about to see is just the obj
 

661
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,069
what we're about to see is just the obj
so the object

662
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
so the object
 

663
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,110
so the object
just the actual 3d printing file

664
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
just the actual 3d printing file
 

665
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,430
just the actual 3d printing file
and bring that into cura and let's see

666
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
and bring that into cura and let's see
 

667
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,190
and bring that into cura and let's see
what we find now we got this little itty

668
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
what we find now we got this little itty
 

669
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,389
what we find now we got this little itty
bitty

670
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399

all right so it's put it up on its end
you can see how that is so what i want

676
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
you can see how that is so what i want
 

677
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,829
you can see how that is so what i want
to do is i want to rotate that

678
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
to do is i want to rotate that
 

679
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,110
to do is i want to rotate that
so i'm just going to click on it click

680
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
so i'm just going to click on it click
 

681
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,509
so i'm just going to click on it click
on the rotate tool and bring it down 90

682
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
on the rotate tool and bring it down 90
 

683
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,230
on the rotate tool and bring it down 90
degrees

684
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
degrees
 

685
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,990
degrees
there we are that's going to put it flat

686
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
there we are that's going to put it flat
 

687
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,430
there we are that's going to put it flat
on the surface but it's still this

688
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
on the surface but it's still this
 

689
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,069
on the surface but it's still this
itty-bitty house for ants so let's

690
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
itty-bitty house for ants so let's
 

691
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,069
itty-bitty house for ants so let's
increase the size of that as well and

692
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
increase the size of that as well and
 

693
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,670
increase the size of that as well and
boop there we are so that's awfully big

boop there we are so that's awfully big
 

695
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,509
boop there we are so that's awfully big
like 200 millimeters let's bring it down

696
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
like 200 millimeters let's bring it down
 

697
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,949
like 200 millimeters let's bring it down
just a little bit

698
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
just a little bit
 

699

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,350
okay so the first thing that i notice
here is that we've got a lot of ground

702

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
building we've got some boulders here
 

707
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,310
building we've got some boulders here
some shrubs

708
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
some shrubs
 

709
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,190
some shrubs

what i'm going to do
 

713
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,710
what i'm going to do
is i'm just going to lower the position

714
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
is i'm just going to lower the position
 

715
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,629

of the house a little bit
 

717
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,509
of the house a little bit
so that we can push that ground into the

718
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
so that we can push that ground into the
 

719
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,310
so that we can push that ground into the
build plate

720
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
build plate
 

721
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,310
build plate
on my printer i don't want to go too far

722
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
on my printer i don't want to go too far
 

723
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,990
on my printer i don't want to go too far
because we don't want to like submerge

724
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,000
because we don't want to like submerge
 

725
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,509
because we don't want to like submerge
the house we just want to

726
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
the house we just want to
 

727
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,990
the house we just want to
pull back some of that that landscaping

pull back some of that that landscaping
 

729
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,430
pull back some of that that landscaping
there so that we're not actually 3d

730
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
there so that we're not actually 3d
 

731
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,310
there so that we're not actually 3d
printing

732
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
printing
 

733
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,350
printing
the dirt and that looks

734
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
the dirt and that looks
 

735
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,190
the dirt and that looks
pretty good we've still got some

736
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
pretty good we've still got some
 

737
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,110
pretty good we've still got some
anomalies like over here you can see

738
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
anomalies like over here you can see
 

739
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,509
anomalies like over here you can see
this

740
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
this
 

741
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,509
this
little uh triangle here which is

little uh triangle here which is
 

743
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,870
little uh triangle here which is
probably a rock or

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
landscaping we're going to have these
 

749
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,509
landscaping we're going to have these
little

750
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
little
 

751
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,190
little
see this little guy right here that's

752
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
see this little guy right here that's
 

753
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,710
see this little guy right here that's
just going to print but it's

754
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
just going to print but it's
 

755
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,389
just going to print but it's
you know not going to be it's something

756
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
you know not going to be it's something
 

757
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,910
you know not going to be it's something
that we keep it's just going to be a

758
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
that we keep it's just going to be a
 

759
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,230
that we keep it's just going to be a
discard you could clean this up like if

760
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
discard you could clean this up like if
 

761
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,310
discard you could clean this up like if
henry wanted to he'd be able to

762
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
henry wanted to he'd be able to
 

763
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,790
henry wanted to he'd be able to
take this into like tinkercad or

764
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
take this into like tinkercad or
 

765
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,629
take this into like tinkercad or
whatever cad program he's using

766
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
whatever cad program he's using
 

767
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,189
whatever cad program he's using
clean it up first fix up the texturing

768
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
clean it up first fix up the texturing
 

769
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,550
clean it up first fix up the texturing
of the windows because these are going

770
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
of the windows because these are going
 

771
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,509
of the windows because these are going
to come out

772
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
to come out
 

773
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,629
to come out
you know looking pretty pretty odd um

774
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
you know looking pretty pretty odd um
 

775
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,310
you know looking pretty pretty odd um
and there's that area where i think

776
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
and there's that area where i think
 

777
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,910
and there's that area where i think
that's is that where the

778
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
that's is that where the
 

779
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,829
that's is that where the
no yeah that's where the tree where

780
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
no yeah that's where the tree where
 

781
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,389
no yeah that's where the tree where
henry was showing us the tree is

782
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
henry was showing us the tree is
 

783
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,710
henry was showing us the tree is
and it looks like a cave so that's going

784
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
and it looks like a cave so that's going
 

785
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,470
and it looks like a cave so that's going
to be rather interesting

786
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
to be rather interesting
 

787
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,310
to be rather interesting
but how cool that this is done i mean

788
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
but how cool that this is done i mean
 

789
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,910
but how cool that this is done i mean
the actual like

790
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
the actual like
 

791
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,910
the actual like
design you can tell it's you know what

792
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
design you can tell it's you know what
 

793
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,150
design you can tell it's you know what
it is that this is done with a

794
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
it is that this is done with a
 

795
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,949
it is that this is done with a
with a quadcopter taken a whole bunch of

796
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
with a quadcopter taken a whole bunch of
 

797
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,829
with a quadcopter taken a whole bunch of
pictures

798
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
pictures
 

799
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,189
pictures
and generally speaking that looks pretty

800
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
and generally speaking that looks pretty
 

801
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,949
and generally speaking that looks pretty
cool so

802
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
cool so
 

803
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,269
cool so
um other than that a couple of quick

804
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
um other than that a couple of quick
 

805
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:17,990
um other than that a couple of quick
mentions

806
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
mentions
 

807
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,389
mentions
is you know typically when you're 3d

808
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
is you know typically when you're 3d
 

809
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,910
is you know typically when you're 3d
printing you're going to need supports

810
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
printing you're going to need supports
 

811
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,150
printing you're going to need supports
if anything overhangs because

812
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
if anything overhangs because
 

813
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,590
if anything overhangs because
otherwise it's just going to droop and

814
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
otherwise it's just going to droop and
 

815
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,949
otherwise it's just going to droop and
and you're going to get this stringing

816
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
and you're going to get this stringing
 

817
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,150
and you're going to get this stringing
coming down

818
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
coming down
 

819
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,069
coming down
so i'm looking for anything here that's

820
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
so i'm looking for anything here that's
 

821
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,310
so i'm looking for anything here that's
going to overhang and i don't really see

822
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
going to overhang and i don't really see
 

823
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,470
going to overhang and i don't really see
much there is this overhang here

824
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
much there is this overhang here
 

825
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,870
much there is this overhang here
and kira is showing me some red to to

826
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
and kira is showing me some red to to
 

827
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,590
and kira is showing me some red to to
tell me that

828
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
tell me that
 

829
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,350
tell me that
this might be a problem but i think

830
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
this might be a problem but i think
 

831
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,670
this might be a problem but i think
because it's such a small

832
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
because it's such a small
 

833
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,590
because it's such a small
uh overhang i think we're probably going

834
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
uh overhang i think we're probably going
 

835
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,389
uh overhang i think we're probably going
to be okay to do it without supports

836
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
to be okay to do it without supports
 

837
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,069
to be okay to do it without supports
we don't need supports you might think

838
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
we don't need supports you might think
 

839
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,910
we don't need supports you might think
well we need to support the roof because

840
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
well we need to support the roof because
 

841
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,710
well we need to support the roof because
you know the roof

842
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
you know the roof
 

843
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,269
you know the roof
is like this and if it's a hollow thing

844
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
is like this and if it's a hollow thing
 

845
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,069
is like this and if it's a hollow thing
then it's

846
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
then it's
 

847
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,389
then it's
uh it's going to you know completely

848
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
uh it's going to you know completely
 

849
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,269
uh it's going to you know completely
cave in

850
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
cave in
 

851
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,350
cave in
but the way kira looks at this when it's

852
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
but the way kira looks at this when it's
 

853
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,870
but the way kira looks at this when it's
slicing it is

854
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
slicing it is
 

855
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,230
slicing it is
it treats this as a solid object so

856
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
it treats this as a solid object so
 

857
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,550
it treats this as a solid object so
rather than supports for the interior of

858
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
rather than supports for the interior of
 

859
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,110
rather than supports for the interior of
the object that's actually called infill

860
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
the object that's actually called infill
 

861
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,230
the object that's actually called infill
so there's a couple of things that we're

862
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
so there's a couple of things that we're
 

863
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,910
so there's a couple of things that we're
going to set here so if we did need

864
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
going to set here so if we did need
 

865
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,110
going to set here so if we did need
supports we're going to click on

866
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
supports we're going to click on
 

867
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,389
supports we're going to click on
generate supports

868
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
generate supports
 

869
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,949
generate supports
i don't think we're going to if i

870
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
i don't think we're going to if i
 

871
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,990
i don't think we're going to if i
preview that

872
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000

 

873
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,509

so i've just clicked on generate

874
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
so i've just clicked on generate
 

875
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,110
so i've just clicked on generate
supports and then slice

876
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
supports and then slice
 

877
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,870
supports and then slice
and i'm previewing i just want to see

878
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
and i'm previewing i just want to see
 

879
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,949
and i'm previewing i just want to see
where it's going to stick supports

880
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
where it's going to stick supports
 

881
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,829
where it's going to stick supports
just to see how badly kira thinks that

882
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
just to see how badly kira thinks that
 

883
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,629
just to see how badly kira thinks that
we need it

884
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
we need it
 

885
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,350
we need it
yeah see the whole outside has now been

886
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
yeah see the whole outside has now been
 

887
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,990
yeah see the whole outside has now been
basically

888
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
basically
 

889
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,470
basically
covered in supports so that would be a

890
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
covered in supports so that would be a
 

891
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,110
covered in supports so that would be a
lot of stuff to trim away

892
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
lot of stuff to trim away
 

893
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,110
lot of stuff to trim away
wow i think we're going to have a

894
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
wow i think we're going to have a
 

895
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,310
wow i think we're going to have a
real problem with this area where the

896
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
real problem with this area where the
 

897
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,269
real problem with this area where the
tree was

898
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
tree was
 

899
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,670
tree was
see how it's completely filled in that

900
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
see how it's completely filled in that
 

901
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,430
see how it's completely filled in that
that area

902
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
that area
 

903
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,910
that area
that could be a problem i think because

904
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
that could be a problem i think because
 

905
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,269
that could be a problem i think because
of the jaggedness of it

906
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
of the jaggedness of it
 

907
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,670
of the jaggedness of it
this particular object is not going to

908
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
this particular object is not going to
 

909
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,269
this particular object is not going to
print well with supports i mean you're

910
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
print well with supports i mean you're
 

911
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,870
print well with supports i mean you're
going to

912
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
going to
 

913
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,790
going to
how would you ever remove so many

914
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
how would you ever remove so many
 

915
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,749
how would you ever remove so many
supports and i think that's because of

916
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
supports and i think that's because of
 

917
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,389
supports and i think that's because of
the fact that being that it's a 3d scan

918
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
the fact that being that it's a 3d scan
 

919
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,550
the fact that being that it's a 3d scan
using just a standard camera

920
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
using just a standard camera
 

921
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,749
using just a standard camera
the edges are not quite perfect as

922
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
the edges are not quite perfect as
 

923
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,470
the edges are not quite perfect as
you've as you've seen there

924
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
you've as you've seen there
 

925
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,269
you've as you've seen there
so that's something that henry might

926
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
so that's something that henry might
 

927
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,470
so that's something that henry might
might want to clean up

928
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
might want to clean up
 

929
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,350
might want to clean up
before trying to 3d print let's turn off

930
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
before trying to 3d print let's turn off
 

931
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,189
before trying to 3d print let's turn off
the supports and i've got an infill

932
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
the supports and i've got an infill
 

933
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,110
the supports and i've got an infill
density of 20

934
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
density of 20
 

935
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,790
density of 20
and we're looking at about 14 hours to

936
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
and we're looking at about 14 hours to
 

937
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,949
and we're looking at about 14 hours to
print with supports my fear is just that

938
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
print with supports my fear is just that
 

939
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,310
print with supports my fear is just that
that's a lot of supports to remove

940
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
that's a lot of supports to remove
 

941
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,870
that's a lot of supports to remove
it might be very difficult now it's not

942
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
it might be very difficult now it's not
 

943
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,470
it might be very difficult now it's not
but it might be worth it

944
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
but it might be worth it
 

945
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,350
but it might be worth it
uh it's a hard thing to call uh this is

946
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
uh it's a hard thing to call uh this is
 

947
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,870
uh it's a hard thing to call uh this is
what it looks like without supports but

948
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
what it looks like without supports but
 

949
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,389
what it looks like without supports but
what i'm looking for is the infill

950
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
what i'm looking for is the infill
 

951
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,189
what i'm looking for is the infill
density

952
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
density
 

953
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,509
density
to make sure that this the roof is going

954
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
to make sure that this the roof is going
 

955
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,629
to make sure that this the roof is going
to be supported so i'm going to pull

956
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
to be supported so i'm going to pull
 

957
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,150
to be supported so i'm going to pull
down my preview here

958
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
down my preview here
 

959
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,470
down my preview here
so that i can see inside what's being

960
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
so that i can see inside what's being
 

961
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,269
so that i can see inside what's being
printed

962
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
printed
 

963
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,790
printed
so you can see that with a 20 percent

964
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
so you can see that with a 20 percent
 

965
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,310
so you can see that with a 20 percent
infill density

966
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
infill density
 

967
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,430
infill density
that is placing these kind of

968
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
that is placing these kind of
 

969
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,430
that is placing these kind of
their supports to hold up that roof

970
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
their supports to hold up that roof
 

971
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,069
their supports to hold up that roof
as it prints but without using you know

972
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
as it prints but without using you know
 

973
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,270
as it prints but without using you know
100 infill

974
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
100 infill
 

975
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,829
100 infill
and wasting a whole lot of filament

976
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
and wasting a whole lot of filament
 

977
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,350
and wasting a whole lot of filament
that's going to take about 10 hours and

978
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
that's going to take about 10 hours and
 

979
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,270
that's going to take about 10 hours and
67 grams of filament

980
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
67 grams of filament
 

981
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,870
67 grams of filament
so if you're wondering well how much is

982
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
so if you're wondering well how much is
 

983
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,390
so if you're wondering well how much is
that going to cost to print at that

984
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
that going to cost to print at that
 

985
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,669
that going to cost to print at that
scale

986
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
scale
 

987
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,069
scale
just go into your calculator and i know

988
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
just go into your calculator and i know
 

989
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,750
just go into your calculator and i know
that i paid forty dollars for the

990
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
that i paid forty dollars for the
 

991
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,029
that i paid forty dollars for the
one kilogram uh of filament so it's four

992
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
one kilogram uh of filament so it's four
 

993
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,510
one kilogram uh of filament so it's four
cents

994
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
cents
 

995
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,590
cents
per gram and we know that this is going

996
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
per gram and we know that this is going
 

997
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,110
per gram and we know that this is going
to be 67

998
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
to be 67
 

999
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,150
to be 67
grams so that's 68 2.68

1000
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
grams so that's 68 2.68
 

1001
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,830
grams so that's 68 2.68
to print at this scale and that's pretty

1002
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
to print at this scale and that's pretty
 

1003
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,230
to print at this scale and that's pretty
big considering my under three

1004
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
big considering my under three
 

1005
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,270
big considering my under three
bed is 220 by 220 millimeters

1006
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
bed is 220 by 220 millimeters
 

1007
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,350
bed is 220 by 220 millimeters
so what you're looking at there is uh

1008
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
so what you're looking at there is uh
 

1009
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,710
so what you're looking at there is uh
you know it is

1010
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
you know it is
 

1011
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,110
you know it is
let's see 143 millimeters

1012
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
let's see 143 millimeters
 

1013
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,669
let's see 143 millimeters
by 112 millimeters so it's pretty big

1014
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
by 112 millimeters so it's pretty big
 

1015
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,430
by 112 millimeters so it's pretty big
so do we print it with or without

1016
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
so do we print it with or without
 

1017
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,510
so do we print it with or without
supports that's the question

1018
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
supports that's the question
 

1019
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,630
supports that's the question
i think we're gonna get a better print

1020
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
i think we're gonna get a better print
 

1021
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,070
i think we're gonna get a better print
if we give it supports

1022
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080

 

1023
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,710

especially in that kind of janky area

1024
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
especially in that kind of janky area
 

1025
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,270
especially in that kind of janky area
where the

1026
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
where the
 

1027
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,470
where the
where the tree was

1028
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
where the tree was
 

1029
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,750
where the tree was
and i think that's going to make it

1030
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
and i think that's going to make it
 

1031
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,070
and i think that's going to make it
worth it i know it is

1032
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
worth it i know it is
 

1033
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,310
worth it i know it is
it's just the additional four hours and

1034
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
it's just the additional four hours and
 

1035
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,230
it's just the additional four hours and
the amount of work to remove

1036
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
the amount of work to remove
 

1037
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,470
the amount of work to remove
all those supports it needs a lot of

1038
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
all those supports it needs a lot of
 

1039
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,549
all those supports it needs a lot of
them

1040
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
them
 

1041
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,110
them
let's see what happens if i change to

1042
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
let's see what happens if i change to
 

1043
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,630
let's see what happens if i change to
just build plate

1044
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
just build plate
 

1045
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,470
just build plate
see if that changes anything and change

1046
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
see if that changes anything and change
 

1047
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,950
see if that changes anything and change
the overhang angle to

1048
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
the overhang angle to
 

1049
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,510
the overhang angle to
um i don't know 60

1050
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
um i don't know 60
 

1051
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,029
um i don't know 60
and see how that changes things

1052
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039

 

1053
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,190

so it's not going to give me as much

1054
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
so it's not going to give me as much
 

1055
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,190
so it's not going to give me as much
support in here

1056
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
support in here
 

1057
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,630
support in here
so that's going to save a fair bit of

1058
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
so that's going to save a fair bit of
 

1059
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,110
so that's going to save a fair bit of
filament and three hours

1060
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
filament and three hours
 

1061
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,150
filament and three hours
um yeah that looks a little better so

1062
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
um yeah that looks a little better so
 

1063
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,510
um yeah that looks a little better so
there are there's still going to be a

1064
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
there are there's still going to be a
 

1065
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,430
there are there's still going to be a
lot of support to remove and i feel like

1066
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
lot of support to remove and i feel like
 

1067
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,029
lot of support to remove and i feel like
with the way this is

1068
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
with the way this is
 

1069
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,190
with the way this is
um with the way the scan is that you're

1070
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
um with the way the scan is that you're
 

1071
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,390
um with the way the scan is that you're
probably going to have some trouble

1072
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
probably going to have some trouble
 

1073
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,230
probably going to have some trouble
figuring out what's a support and what's

1074
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
figuring out what's a support and what's
 

1075
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,310
figuring out what's a support and what's
actually part of the scan

1076
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
actually part of the scan
 

1077
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,909
actually part of the scan
so i think that's what we're going to be

1078
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
so i think that's what we're going to be
 

1079
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,830
so i think that's what we're going to be
up against so

1080
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
up against so
 

1081
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,870
up against so
for that reason and for the sake of the

1082
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
for that reason and for the sake of the
 

1083
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,870
for that reason and for the sake of the
the demonstration i'm going to try

1084
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
the demonstration i'm going to try
 

1085
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,070
the demonstration i'm going to try
scaling it down a bit

1086
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
scaling it down a bit
 

1087
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,669
scaling it down a bit
so that the overhangs are not as big

1088
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
so that the overhangs are not as big
 

1089
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,630
so that the overhangs are not as big
as they would be if it was 143

1090
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
as they would be if it was 143
 

1091
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,070
as they would be if it was 143
millimeters wide

1092
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
millimeters wide
 

1093
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,830
millimeters wide
so i'm going to make this about 50

1094
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
so i'm going to make this about 50
 

1095
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,310
so i'm going to make this about 50
millimeters

1096
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
millimeters
 

1097
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,590
millimeters
width and see

1098
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
width and see
 

1099
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,110
width and see
how that slices up with no supports

1100
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
how that slices up with no supports
 

1101
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,270
how that slices up with no supports
so it's going to be a lot smaller but

1102
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
so it's going to be a lot smaller but
 

1103
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,230
so it's going to be a lot smaller but
it's going to

1104
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
it's going to
 

1105
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,310
it's going to
probably do a lot better without

1106
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
probably do a lot better without
 

1107
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,430
probably do a lot better without
supports because

1108
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
supports because
 

1109
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,710
supports because
we don't have such a pronounced overhang

1110
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
we don't have such a pronounced overhang
 

1111
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,909
we don't have such a pronounced overhang
and let's give that a go i'm going to

1112
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
and let's give that a go i'm going to
 

1113
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,830
and let's give that a go i'm going to
send that over to my printer

1114
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
send that over to my printer
 

1115
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:52,310
send that over to my printer
and we'll see how she comes out

1116
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,320
and we'll see how she comes out
 

1117
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,870
and we'll see how she comes out
there it is this is my tiny house oh

1118
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
there it is this is my tiny house oh
 

1119
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,350
there it is this is my tiny house oh
it's so

1120
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
it's so
 

1121
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,909
it's so
cute i have always wanted to live in a

1122
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
cute i have always wanted to live in a
 

1123
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,750
cute i have always wanted to live in a
tiny house everyone who knows me

1124
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
tiny house everyone who knows me
 

1125
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,270
tiny house everyone who knows me
knows i'm a tiny house kind of guy and

i printed it in

1162
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
i printed it in
 

1163
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,590
i printed it in
white filament for you because i thought

1164
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
white filament for you because i thought
 

1165
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,029
white filament for you because i thought
hey maybe you'd want to prime it and

1166
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
hey maybe you'd want to prime it and
 

1167
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,990
hey maybe you'd want to prime it and
paint it

1168

paint it
 

1169
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,549
paint it
um but then i realized as i was running

1170
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
um but then i realized as i was running
 

1171
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,230
um but then i realized as i was running
it that the cameras kind of don't like

1172
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
it that the cameras kind of don't like
 

1173
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,270
it that the cameras kind of don't like
white filament

1174
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
white filament
 

1175
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,029
white filament
because they white balance yourselves

1176
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
because they white balance yourselves
 

1177
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,310
because they white balance yourselves
and overexpose

1178
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
and overexpose
 

1179
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,149
and overexpose
themselves yeah it's like what are you

1180
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159

00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
that's tough that's tough our poor
 

1185
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,950
that's tough that's tough our poor
camera guy is just like ah i don't

get it seriously like that amount of

1188
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
get it seriously like that amount of
 

1189
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,750
get it seriously like that amount of
detail that you managed to get out of

1190
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
detail that you managed to get out of
 

1191
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,350
detail that you managed to get out of
that 3d model that's pretty

1192
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
that 3d model that's pretty
 

1193
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,149
that 3d model that's pretty
amazing eh well you took your drone up

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,990
and just kind of it
software took it around and flew

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
software took it around and flew
 

1199
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,710
software took it around and flew
overhead

1200
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
overhead
 

1201
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,110
overhead
yeah so like literally from the future

1202
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
yeah so like literally from the future
 

1203
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,149
yeah so like literally from the future
what you're able to see

1204
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
what you're able to see
 

1205
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,510
what you're able to see
is that literally we just did our kind

1206
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
is that literally we just did our kind
 

1207
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,190
is that literally we just did our kind
of grid patterns we were able to take

1208
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
of grid patterns we were able to take
 

1209
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,470
of grid patterns we were able to take
those photos

1210
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
those photos
 

1211
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,230
those photos
mash them all together in a blender and

1212
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
mash them all together in a blender and
 

1213
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,149
mash them all together in a blender and
out comes this now how hard was it now

1214
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
out comes this now how hard was it now
 

1215
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,310
out comes this now how hard was it now
when you sent me this it was an obj file

1216
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
when you sent me this it was an obj file
 

1217
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,350
when you sent me this it was an obj file
it was already a 3d ready yeah pretty

it was already a 3d ready yeah pretty
 

1219
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,190
it was already a 3d ready yeah pretty
much ready to print as you saw yeah

blender that means you could take this
 

1261
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,390

house that you scanned yeah
 

1263
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,669
house that you scanned yeah
and put it in a 3d movie that you create

1264
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:05,679
and put it in a 3d movie that you create
 

1265

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
real engine
 

1269
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,110
real engine
you could put yourself in it you could

1270
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
you could put yourself in it you could
 

1271
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,950
you could put yourself in it you could
so you put it you could put it in a game

1272
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
so you put it you could put it in a game

yeah so i've actually had this exact
 

1275
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,350
yeah so i've actually had this exact
same model in unreal for running so like

1276
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
same model in unreal for running so like
 

1277
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,190
same model in unreal for running so like
i could have like little fires around it

1278
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
i could have like little fires around it

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,710
could have like a sky box
so there's so many applications for this

1284
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
so there's so many applications for this
 

1285
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,029
so there's so many applications for this
cool i mean like again besides the 3d

1286
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
cool i mean like again besides the 3d
 

1287
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,029
cool i mean like again besides the 3d
environment so like video photo

1288
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
environment so like video photo
 

1289
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,110
environment so like video photo
film things like that yeah um i think i

1290
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120

sell a house to someone blind and
describe the exterior

1302
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
describe the exterior
 

1303
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,870
describe the exterior
yeah you mentioned that that it's like

1304
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
yeah you mentioned that that it's like
 

1305
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,549
yeah you mentioned that that it's like
okay well you can actually feel it

1306
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
okay well you can actually feel it
 

1307
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,710
okay well you can actually feel it
exactly now you can literally 3d print

1308
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
exactly now you can literally 3d print
 

1309
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,590
exactly now you can literally 3d print
your house

1310
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
your house
 

1311
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,070

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,750
what it looks like feel and is that
legit like

legit like
 

1319
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,630
legit like
do people like it maybe if some of our

do people like it maybe if some of our
 

1321
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,750
do people like it maybe if some of our
our folks that have

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
our folks that have
 

1323
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,270
our folks that have
uh vision problems would that be a

1324
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
uh vision problems would that be a
 

1325
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,870
uh vision problems would that be a
benefit to you would that be a selling

1326
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
benefit to you would that be a selling
 

1327
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,430
benefit to you would that be a selling
feature

1328
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
feature
 

1329
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,470
feature
for even just education things like that

1330
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
for even just education things like that
 

1331
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,070
for even just education things like that
right like being able to do like

1332
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
right like being able to do like
 

1333
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,230
right like being able to do like
historic monuments or things like that

1334
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
historic monuments or things like that
 

1335
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,870
historic monuments or things like that
i think see from my perspective henry

1336
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
i think see from my perspective henry
 

1337
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,470
i think see from my perspective henry
yeah this does a couple of things

1338
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
yeah this does a couple of things
 

1339
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,909
yeah this does a couple of things
um in that it captures buildings or

1340
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
um in that it captures buildings or
 

1341
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,990
um in that it captures buildings or
whatever it might be maybe landscapes or

1342
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
whatever it might be maybe landscapes or
 

1343
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,029
whatever it might be maybe landscapes or
whatever

1344
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
whatever
 

1345
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,430
whatever
in such a way that it will last forever

1346
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
in such a way that it will last forever
 

1347
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,190
in such a way that it will last forever
as you say you can throw it in an unreal

1348
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
as you say you can throw it in an unreal
 

1349
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,390
as you say you can throw it in an unreal
engine with the textures

1350
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
engine with the textures
 

1351
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,190
engine with the textures
exactly it will even if the building

1352
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
exactly it will even if the building
 

1353
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,310
exactly it will even if the building
disintegrates

1354
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
disintegrates
 

1355
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,310
disintegrates
it's forever captured well that's the

1356
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
it's forever captured well that's the
 

1357
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,990
it's forever captured well that's the
thing is that there's a there's a lot of

1358
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
thing is that there's a there's a lot of
 

1359
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,510
thing is that there's a there's a lot of
famous stories about people going in the

1360
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
famous stories about people going in the
 

1361
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,789
famous stories about people going in the
middle east and as you know there's a

1362
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
middle east and as you know there's a
 

1363
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,149
middle east and as you know there's a
lot of conflicts over there

1364
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
lot of conflicts over there
 

1365
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,830
lot of conflicts over there
but before a lot of these buildings and

1366
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840
but before a lot of these buildings and
 

1367
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,510
but before a lot of these buildings and
stuff were destroyed yeah

1368
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
stuff were destroyed yeah
 

1369
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,750
stuff were destroyed yeah
um people actually went in with uh

1370
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
um people actually went in with uh
 

1371
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,110
um people actually went in with uh
photogrammetry kits

1372
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
photogrammetry kits
 

1373
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,870
photogrammetry kits
and they were actually able to capture

1374
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
and they were actually able to capture
 

1375
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,549
and they were actually able to capture
all these older monuments all these

1376
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:44,559
all these older monuments all these
 

1377
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,430
all these older monuments all these
older

1378
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
older
 

1379
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,110
older
uh beautiful places so they were

1380
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
uh beautiful places so they were
 

1381
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,710
uh beautiful places so they were
destroyed so yeah

1382
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
destroyed so yeah
 

1383
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,830
destroyed so yeah
they're they're they're going to live on

1384
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
they're they're they're going to live on
 

1385
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,990
they're they're they're going to live on
forever now in 3d format where future

1386
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
forever now in 3d format where future
 

1387
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,990
forever now in 3d format where future
generations can go and say

1388
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
generations can go and say
 

1389
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,830
generations can go and say
yeah this is like this place at the very

1390
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
yeah this is like this place at the very
 

1391
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,350
yeah this is like this place at the very
least they can see it in like virtual

1392
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
least they can see it in like virtual
 

1393
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,029
least they can see it in like virtual
reality yeah exactly

1394
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
reality yeah exactly
 

1395
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,190
reality yeah exactly
and it's literally i'm really excited

1396
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
and it's literally i'm really excited
 

1397
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,549
and it's literally i'm really excited
this is just the start of this

1398
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
this is just the start of this
 

1399
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,110
this is just the start of this
technology it's it's fantastic

1400
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
technology it's it's fantastic
 

1401

technology it's it's fantastic
wonderful well thank you so much for

1402
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
wonderful well thank you so much for
 

1403
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,070
wonderful well thank you so much for
sharing that with us henry that's really

1404
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
sharing that with us henry that's really
 

1405

really cool stuff
 

1407
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,870
really cool stuff
thank you for printing it it's it looks

1408
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
thank you for printing it it's it looks
 

1409
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,990
thank you for printing it it's it looks
a lot

1410
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
a lot
 

1411
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,070
a lot
more realistic in real life than it does

1412
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
more realistic in real life than it does
 

1413
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,070
more realistic in real life than it does
on a computer and when you brought it up

1414
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
on a computer and when you brought it up
 

1415
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,830
on a computer and when you brought it up
when you brought it up with the textures

1416
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
when you brought it up with the textures
 

1417
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,269
when you brought it up with the textures
and everything it was it was

1418
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
and everything it was it was
 

1419
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,269
and everything it was it was
very very real-looking that was really

1420
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
very very real-looking that was really
 

1421
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,269
very very real-looking that was really
fun and that was with an older version

1422
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
fun and that was with an older version
 

1423
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,390
fun and that was with an older version
of that program that

1424
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
of that program that
 

1425
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,230
of that program that
that the model that we used for this was

1426
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
that the model that we used for this was
 

1427
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,990
that the model that we used for this was
around three or four years old

1428
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
around three or four years old
 

1429
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,909
around three or four years old
okay so the methods that the programs

1430
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
okay so the methods that the programs
 

1431
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,070
okay so the methods that the programs
use now their algorithms are actually so

1432
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
use now their algorithms are actually so
 

1433
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,669
use now their algorithms are actually so
much more accurate and i'm using an

1434
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
much more accurate and i'm using an
 

1435
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,310
much more accurate and i'm using an
older drone right so phantom 3 pro

1436
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
older drone right so phantom 3 pro
 

1437
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,990
older drone right so phantom 3 pro
my friend uses a maverick they have a

1438
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
my friend uses a maverick they have a
 

1439
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,470
my friend uses a maverick they have a
matrix as well so like a 10 000 drone

1440
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
matrix as well so like a 10 000 drone
 

1441
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,870
matrix as well so like a 10 000 drone
wow imagine how that looks having like a

1442

dslr camera unreal is this the same tech

1446
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
dslr camera unreal is this the same tech
 

1447
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,430
dslr camera unreal is this the same tech
like when i see on google earth yeah it

1448
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
like when i see on google earth yeah it
 

1449
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,789
like when i see on google earth yeah it
is it actually is

1450
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
is it actually is
 

1451
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,669
is it actually is
so um a lot of people think that um you

1452
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:53,679
so um a lot of people think that um you
 

1453
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,149
so um a lot of people think that um you
can even use lidar or like floor things

1454
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
can even use lidar or like floor things
 

1455
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,190
can even use lidar or like floor things
you which you can

1456
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
you which you can
 

1457
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,430
you which you can
and it makes more accurate with using

1458
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
and it makes more accurate with using
 

1459
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,789
and it makes more accurate with using
lidar and fleur

1460
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
lidar and fleur
 

1461
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,990
lidar and fleur
but yeah so google maps bing maps those

1462
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
but yeah so google maps bing maps those
 

1463
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,789
but yeah so google maps bing maps those
guys

1464
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
guys
 

1465
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,070
guys
um they literally just use

1466
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
um they literally just use
 

1467
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,909
um they literally just use
photogrammetry so they have multiple

1468
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
photogrammetry so they have multiple
 

1469
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,390
photogrammetry so they have multiple
pictures from satellites yeah up in the

1470
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
pictures from satellites yeah up in the
 

1471
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,230
pictures from satellites yeah up in the
grape view blue yonder

1472
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
grape view blue yonder
 

1473
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,549
grape view blue yonder
and they have similar programs are able

1474
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
and they have similar programs are able
 

1475
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,149
and they have similar programs are able
to stitch that together they're using

1476
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
to stitch that together they're using
 

1477
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,590
to stitch that together they're using
satellite imagery to do what you're

1478
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
satellite imagery to do what you're
 

1479
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,950
satellite imagery to do what you're
doing with a drone it's pretty much this

1480
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
doing with a drone it's pretty much this
 

1481
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,870
doing with a drone it's pretty much this
but on steroids yeah so instead of

1482
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
but on steroids yeah so instead of
 

1483
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,870
but on steroids yeah so instead of
using a drone they're using satellites

1484
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
using a drone they're using satellites
 

1485
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,390
using a drone they're using satellites
and using uh

1486
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
and using uh
 

1487
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,430
and using uh
amazing data putting things together

1488
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
amazing data putting things together
 

1489
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,350
amazing data putting things together
and yeah so how do you see your house on

1490

and yeah so how do you see your house on
 

1491
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,789
and yeah so how do you see your house on
google earth and of course there are

1492
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
google earth and of course there are
 

1493
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,269
google earth and of course there are
some

1494
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
some
 

1495
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,390
some
ai um like some

1496
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
ai um like some
 

1497
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,870
ai um like some
ais are fixing a few errors here and

1498
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
ais are fixing a few errors here and
 

1499
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,590
ais are fixing a few errors here and
there but

1500
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
there but
 

1501
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,190
there but
when it comes down to it yeah that's the

1502
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,200
when it comes down to it yeah that's the
 

1503
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,870
when it comes down to it yeah that's the
basics of how

1504
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
basics of how
 

1505
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,070
basics of how
a lot of these companies are doing

1506
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
a lot of these companies are doing
 

1507
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,909
a lot of these companies are doing
things now cool stuff so yeah

1508
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
things now cool stuff so yeah
 

1509
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,830
things now cool stuff so yeah
i'm really keen to see how this brings

1510
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
i'm really keen to see how this brings
 

1511
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,590
i'm really keen to see how this brings
real world objects into

1512
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
real world objects into
 

1513
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,909
real world objects into
same here things like video games like i

1514
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
same here things like video games like i
 

1515
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:50,630
same here things like video games like i
really think

1516
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
really think
 

1517
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,789
really think
with virtual reality to be able to well

1518
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
with virtual reality to be able to well
 

1519
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,549
with virtual reality to be able to well
we actually already see this um a famous

1520
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:54,559
we actually already see this um a famous
 

1521
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,830
we actually already see this um a famous
one that just came out is the new

1522
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
one that just came out is the new
 

1523
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,430
one that just came out is the new
microsoft light sim right that

1524
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
microsoft light sim right that
 

1525
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,510
microsoft light sim right that
the entire 3d world is just big maps

1526
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
the entire 3d world is just big maps
 

1527
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,669
the entire 3d world is just big maps
but it's just in a 3d environment and

1528
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
but it's just in a 3d environment and
 

1529
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,430
but it's just in a 3d environment and
for years we've always had flights in

1530
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
for years we've always had flights in
 

1531
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,789
for years we've always had flights in
google earth where you just use your

1532
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
google earth where you just use your
 

1533
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,909
google earth where you just use your
arrow keys but

1534
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:07,919
arrow keys but
 

1535
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,830
arrow keys but
that's not a flight sim but it's it's

1536

that's not a flight sim but it's it's
 

1537
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,669
that's not a flight sim but it's it's
amazing to see where we're going with

1538
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
amazing to see where we're going with

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,590
yeah and use that to store energy i
think that's absolutely fantastic

1920
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
think that's absolutely fantastic
 

1921
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,830
think that's absolutely fantastic
talking about a green energy source

1922
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:47,840
talking about a green energy source
 

1923
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,230
talking about a green energy source
what a clever idea but like how much

1924
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,240
what a clever idea but like how much
 

1925
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,509
what a clever idea but like how much
pressure

1926
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
pressure
 

1927
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,830
pressure
is this thing under more than me

1928
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
is this thing under more than me
 

1929
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,230
is this thing under more than me
whenever i had work but still oh boy

1930
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
whenever i had work but still oh boy
 

1931
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,789
whenever i had work but still oh boy
um no but it's it's a remarkable idea

1932
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
um no but it's it's a remarkable idea
 

1933
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,269
um no but it's it's a remarkable idea
and

1934
00:32:59,269 --> 00:32:59,279
and
 

1935
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,590
and
i really like how they really focused on

1936
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600
i really like how they really focused on
 

1937
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,430
i really like how they really focused on
the idea of green energy because again

1938
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
the idea of green energy because again
 

1939
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,110
the idea of green energy because again
unlike batteries where you have to have

1940
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,120
unlike batteries where you have to have
 

1941
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,789
unlike batteries where you have to have
all these minerals everything else dug

1942
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
all these minerals everything else dug
 

1943
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,350
all these minerals everything else dug
up

1944
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
up
 

1945
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,549
up
you're able to use this it's just air

1946
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
you're able to use this it's just air
 

1947
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,070
you're able to use this it's just air
it's it's under compression and it's

1948
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
it's it's under compression and it's
 

1949
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,990
it's it's under compression and it's
able to store energy yes and thinking of

1950
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
able to store energy yes and thinking of
 

1951
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,669
able to store energy yes and thinking of
batteries not only do you have to

1952
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
batteries not only do you have to
 

1953
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,149
batteries not only do you have to
obtain the resources but when those are

1954
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:18,159
obtain the resources but when those are
 

1955
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:18,870
obtain the resources but when those are
depleted

1956
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
depleted
 

1957
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,310

when they're no longer able to hold

1958
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
when they're no longer able to hold
 

1959
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,389
when they're no longer able to hold
exactly the waste everything else

1960
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
exactly the waste everything else
 

1961
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,950
exactly the waste everything else
yeah yeah that's exactly right one less

1962
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
yeah yeah that's exactly right one less
 

1963
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,310
yeah yeah that's exactly right one less
thing to worry about and

1964
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,320
thing to worry about and
 

1965
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,549
thing to worry about and
it's just amazing these technologies and

1966
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
it's just amazing these technologies and
 

1967
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,590
it's just amazing these technologies and
i'm curious

1968
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
i'm curious
 

1969
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,549
i'm curious
to see what they think of next i i love

1970
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
to see what they think of next i i love
 

1971
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,750
to see what they think of next i i love
the idea of

1972
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
the idea of
 

1973
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,590
the idea of
an energy source that is able to kind of

1974
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,600
an energy source that is able to kind of
 

1975
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,950
an energy source that is able to kind of
recycle itself

1976
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
recycle itself
 

1977
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,789
recycle itself
yes and that's kind of what this reminds

1978
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:38,799
yes and that's kind of what this reminds
 

1979
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,470
yes and that's kind of what this reminds
me of i've thought about and i know it's

1980
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
me of i've thought about and i know it's
 

1981
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,830
me of i've thought about and i know it's
not practical and i know that it's

1982
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
not practical and i know that it's
 

1983
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,669
not practical and i know that it's
probably not even possible but

1984
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
probably not even possible but
 

1985
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,389
probably not even possible but
um putting like uh you know you know in

1986
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
um putting like uh you know you know in
 

1987
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,310
um putting like uh you know you know in
a water source something that can pump

1988
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,320
a water source something that can pump
 

1989
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,590
a water source something that can pump
the water because

1990
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600
the water because
 

1991
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,430
the water because
and and generate electricity at the same

1992
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
and and generate electricity at the same
 

1993
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,110
and and generate electricity at the same
time there's so many neat ideas out

1994
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
time there's so many neat ideas out
 

1995
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,909
time there's so many neat ideas out
there

1996
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
there
 

1997
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,269
there
this is something that's actually coming

1998
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
this is something that's actually coming
 

1999
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,190
this is something that's actually coming
to pass well that this is the number one

2000
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
to pass well that this is the number one
 

2001
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,230
to pass well that this is the number one
thing because

2002
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,240
thing because
 

2003
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,789
thing because
with in respect to green technology the

2004
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
with in respect to green technology the
 

2005
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,310
with in respect to green technology the
big the largest thing that's been

2006
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
big the largest thing that's been
 

2007
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,350
big the largest thing that's been
lagging behind

2008
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
lagging behind
 

2009
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,789
lagging behind
is definitely being able to store that

2010
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:04,799
is definitely being able to store that
 

2011
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,310
is definitely being able to store that
energy because again we do have these

2012
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,320
energy because again we do have these
 

2013
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,470
energy because again we do have these
advances in solar power wind power

2014
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:08,480
advances in solar power wind power
 

2015
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,069
advances in solar power wind power
but the issue is where do you store all

2016
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:10,079
but the issue is where do you store all
 

2017
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,589
but the issue is where do you store all
that where do you put it yeah so this

2018
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:11,599
that where do you put it yeah so this
 

2019
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,270
that where do you put it yeah so this
can definitely be one of those solutions

2020
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,280
can definitely be one of those solutions
 

2021
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,790
can definitely be one of those solutions
that can help us

2022
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:14,800
that can help us
 

2023
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,030
that can help us
help turn our economy our world into a

2024
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
help turn our economy our world into a
 

2025
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,470
help turn our economy our world into a
more greener place

2026
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:18,480
more greener place
 

2027
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,149
more greener place
down the road so this this is really

2028
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:20,159
down the road so this this is really
 

2029
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,589
down the road so this this is really
really cool here can't wait to see what

2030
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
really cool here can't wait to see what
 

2031
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,310
really cool here can't wait to see what
comes of it

2032
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
comes of it
 

2033
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,909
comes of it
yeah or hears of it or smells of it

2034
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:25,919
yeah or hears of it or smells of it
 

2035
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,669
yeah or hears of it or smells of it
i'm trying to think of air puns but it's

2036

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,430
through the roof
now that was 2018 how does that same

2244
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
now that was 2018 how does that same
 

2245
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,190
now that was 2018 how does that same
picture look today

2246
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,200
picture look today
 

2247
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,390
picture look today
if i expand this here to today

2248
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
if i expand this here to today
 

2249
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,109
if i expand this here to today
then here this is the little blip with

2250
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
then here this is the little blip with
 

2251
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,030
then here this is the little blip with
cryptokittles the fees

2252
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
cryptokittles the fees
 

2253
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,430
cryptokittles the fees
that we had to pay because of d5 not so

2254
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:19,440
that we had to pay because of d5 not so
 

2255
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,390
that we had to pay because of d5 not so
long ago

2256
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,400
long ago
 

2257
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,750
long ago
were significantly higher and if you

2258
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
were significantly higher and if you
 

2259
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,829
were significantly higher and if you
consider that we are how many people are

2260
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:25,839
consider that we are how many people are
 

2261
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,349
consider that we are how many people are
we using the ethereum blockchain

2262
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
we using the ethereum blockchain
 

2263
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,829
we using the ethereum blockchain
let's say 100 000 200 000 it won't be

2264
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:29,839
let's say 100 000 200 000 it won't be
 

2265
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,190
let's say 100 000 200 000 it won't be
much more than that so if 200 000 can

2266
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,200
much more than that so if 200 000 can
 

2267
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,950
much more than that so if 200 000 can
already

2268
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:34,960
already
 

2269
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,829
already
bring the blockchain uh in regards to

2270
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:37,839
bring the blockchain uh in regards to
 

2271
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,670
bring the blockchain uh in regards to
fees to a halt

2272
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:39,680
fees to a halt
 

2273
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,430
fees to a halt
how would that look like if we have got

2274
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:41,440
how would that look like if we have got
 

2275
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,030
how would that look like if we have got
certainly 20 million people

2276
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
certainly 20 million people
 

2277
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,829
certainly 20 million people
using this chain it will not be feasible

2278
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:45,839
using this chain it will not be feasible
 

2279
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,589
using this chain it will not be feasible
any longer and that's why

2280
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
any longer and that's why
 

2281
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,310
any longer and that's why
um including also some other reasons a

2282
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,320
um including also some other reasons a
 

2283
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,589
um including also some other reasons a
long time ago

2284
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599
long time ago
 

2285
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,790
long time ago
the idea of ethereum 2.0 was started and

2286
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
the idea of ethereum 2.0 was started and
 

2287
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,790
the idea of ethereum 2.0 was started and
it taking it's it's taking its time and

2288
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:56,800
it taking it's it's taking its time and
 

2289
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,589
it taking it's it's taking its time and
why

2290
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
why
 

2291
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,829
why
because coding and programming is not

2292
00:38:59,829 --> 00:38:59,839
because coding and programming is not
 

2293
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,589
because coding and programming is not
simple yeah if you have got a company

2294
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:01,599
simple yeah if you have got a company
 

2295
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,430
simple yeah if you have got a company
like apple or google where everything is

2296
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440
like apple or google where everything is
 

2297
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,630
like apple or google where everything is
under one roof

2298
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
under one roof
 

2299
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,470
under one roof
everything is coordinated in a different

2300
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
everything is coordinated in a different
 

2301
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,390
everything is coordinated in a different
way you can have

2302
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
way you can have
 

2303
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,750
way you can have
a different type of transparency and

2304
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:11,760
a different type of transparency and
 

2305
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,030
a different type of transparency and
and also objectives but if you have got

2306
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040
and also objectives but if you have got
 

2307
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,430
and also objectives but if you have got
a team of 400 people that are

2308
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,440
a team of 400 people that are
 

2309
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,470
a team of 400 people that are
coordinated

2310
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
coordinated
 

2311
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,710
coordinated
through something like github yeah so

2312
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:20,720
through something like github yeah so
 

2313
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,950
through something like github yeah so
this github is where everything

2314
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:22,960
this github is where everything
 

2315
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,670
this github is where everything
happens in regards to ethereum then it

2316
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:25,680
happens in regards to ethereum then it
 

2317
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,310
happens in regards to ethereum then it
looks very

2318
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,320
looks very
 

2319
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,069
looks very
it's very complex and so everything has

2320
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
it's very complex and so everything has
 

2321
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,470
it's very complex and so everything has
to be done very meticulously

2322
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
to be done very meticulously
 

2323
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,630
to be done very meticulously
because we're talking about money here

2324
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
because we're talking about money here
 

2325
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,550
because we're talking about money here
in this case

2326
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
in this case
 

2327
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,950
in this case
money transfer so big mistakes will cost

2328
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
money transfer so big mistakes will cost
 

2329
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,390
money transfer so big mistakes will cost
a lot of money as we've seen

2330
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
a lot of money as we've seen
 

2331
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,670
a lot of money as we've seen
in d5 and we've got over in the ethereum

2332
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
in d5 and we've got over in the ethereum
 

2333
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,230
in d5 and we've got over in the ethereum
current

2334
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
current
 

2335
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,990
current
blockchain we've got over 244

2336
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
blockchain we've got over 244
 

2337
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,630
blockchain we've got over 244
repositories over 500 people

2338
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:46,640
repositories over 500 people
 

2339
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,510
repositories over 500 people
uh programming uh so you can imagine how

2340
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,520
uh programming uh so you can imagine how
 

2341
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,349
uh programming uh so you can imagine how
complex this whole thing is yeah there

2342
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
complex this whole thing is yeah there
 

2343
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,670
complex this whole thing is yeah there
are many hundred thousand lines of code

2344
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
are many hundred thousand lines of code
 

2345
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,990
are many hundred thousand lines of code
that need to be coordinated that's why

2346
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,000
that need to be coordinated that's why
 

2347
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,030
that need to be coordinated that's why
this thing takes

2348
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
this thing takes
 

2349
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,829
this thing takes
so long now looking at the roadmap

2350
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
so long now looking at the roadmap
 

2351
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,349
so long now looking at the roadmap
this is the roadmap of the

2352
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,359
this is the roadmap of the
 

2353
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,030
this is the roadmap of the
of eth 2.0 so this is the current chain

2354
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
of eth 2.0 so this is the current chain
 

2355
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,309
of eth 2.0 so this is the current chain
here so this is

2356
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:10,319
here so this is
 

2357
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,589
here so this is
1.0 that's the ethereum you and i know

2358
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599
1.0 that's the ethereum you and i know
 

2359
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,589
1.0 that's the ethereum you and i know
and soon we will have the beacon chain

2360
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
and soon we will have the beacon chain
 

2361
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,710
and soon we will have the beacon chain
which is the start of ethereum 2.0

2362
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:18,720
which is the start of ethereum 2.0
 

2363
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,470
which is the start of ethereum 2.0
and this here is like the current chain

2364
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
and this here is like the current chain
 

2365
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,870
and this here is like the current chain
without proof of work so proof of stake

2366
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
without proof of work so proof of stake
 

2367
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,150
without proof of work so proof of stake
and you will not have any smart

2368
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,160
and you will not have any smart
 

2369
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,349
and you will not have any smart
contracts in this

2370
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359
contracts in this
 

2371
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,230
contracts in this
uh phase zero from there we will start

2372
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
uh phase zero from there we will start
 

2373
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,589
uh phase zero from there we will start
with the fa with this

2374
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
with the fa with this
 

2375
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,750
with the fa with this
smart contracts but we'll have shards

2376
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:33,760
smart contracts but we'll have shards
 

2377
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,270
smart contracts but we'll have shards
and charts i like

2378
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
and charts i like
 

2379
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,670
and charts i like
just imagine in a very simple way like

2380
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:37,680
just imagine in a very simple way like
 

2381
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,390
just imagine in a very simple way like
sub

2382
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
sub
 

2383
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,030
sub
blockchain so you'll have a chain for

2384
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
blockchain so you'll have a chain for
 

2385
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,829
blockchain so you'll have a chain for
let's say

2386
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:41,839
let's say
 

2387
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,630
let's say
uh d5 you'll have a chain that's that

2388
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
uh d5 you'll have a chain that's that
 

2389
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,870
uh d5 you'll have a chain that's that
needs to be secured in a special way

2390
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:46,880
needs to be secured in a special way
 

2391
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,109
needs to be secured in a special way
then you've got a new chain for uh

2392
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
then you've got a new chain for uh
 

2393
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,150
then you've got a new chain for uh
gamers

2394
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
gamers
 

2395
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,470
gamers
so when something happens like with

2396
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:52,480
so when something happens like with
 

2397
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,630
so when something happens like with
cryptokitties where suddenly

2398
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
cryptokitties where suddenly
 

2399
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,710
cryptokitties where suddenly
the chain was blocked it will be only

2400
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
the chain was blocked it will be only
 

2401
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,470
the chain was blocked it will be only
that chain that will be blocked at that

2402
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,480
that chain that will be blocked at that
 

2403
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,190
that chain that will be blocked at that
time

2404
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,200
time
 

2405
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,710
time
and the fees will not go through the

2406
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:00,720
and the fees will not go through the
 

2407
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,309
and the fees will not go through the
roof so there are

2408
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
roof so there are
 

2409
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,829
roof so there are
lots of little improvements coming also

2410
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:04,839
lots of little improvements coming also
 

2411
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,150
lots of little improvements coming also
along uh

2412
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,160
along uh
 

2413
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,750
along uh
with this er 2.0 and the roadmap in

2414
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760
with this er 2.0 and the roadmap in
 

2415
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,950
with this er 2.0 and the roadmap in
detail

2416
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:10,960
detail
 

2417
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,190
detail
just the ones that we hear today and we

2418
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,200
just the ones that we hear today and we
 

2419
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,150
just the ones that we hear today and we
will start soon

2420
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,160
will start soon
 

2421
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,270
will start soon
uh phase zero uh phase zero means

2422
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:17,280
uh phase zero uh phase zero means
 

2423
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,069
uh phase zero uh phase zero means
um moving away from proof of work to

2424
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
um moving away from proof of work to
 

2425
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,270
um moving away from proof of work to
proof of stake

2426
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
proof of stake
 

2427
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,109
proof of stake
and that's done by having a deposit

2428
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:23,119
and that's done by having a deposit
 

2429
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,870
and that's done by having a deposit
contract because you need to secure the

2430
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:24,880
contract because you need to secure the
 

2431
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,190
contract because you need to secure the
network not through miners so people

2432
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
network not through miners so people
 

2433
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,950
network not through miners so people
that are mining you need to secure it

2434
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
that are mining you need to secure it
 

2435
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,470
that are mining you need to secure it
through value

2436
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480
through value
 

2437
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,109
through value
and um that for that the deposit

2438
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
and um that for that the deposit
 

2439
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,390
and um that for that the deposit
contract was now

2440
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
contract was now
 

2441
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,349
contract was now
created and the time is running now

2442
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:37,359
created and the time is running now
 

2443
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:37,910
created and the time is running now
until

2444
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
until
 

2445
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,950
until
the 7th of december where

2446
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:40,960
the 7th of december where
 

2447
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,430
the 7th of december where
then the beacon chain will be started

2448
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:43,440
then the beacon chain will be started
 

2449
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,510
then the beacon chain will be started
from there we will then go over to phase

2450
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520
from there we will then go over to phase
 

2451
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,589
from there we will then go over to phase
0 and then much later phase two

2452
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:47,599
0 and then much later phase two
 

2453
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,230
0 and then much later phase two
and phase three and at this stage you

2454
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
and phase three and at this stage you
 

2455
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,910
and phase three and at this stage you
there will be also no more proof of work

2456
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:51,920
there will be also no more proof of work
 

2457
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,190
there will be also no more proof of work
so the current

2458
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,200
so the current
 

2459
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,950
so the current
blockchain that you know is point zero

2460
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:54,960
blockchain that you know is point zero
 

2461
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,390
blockchain that you know is point zero
will be more or less switched off

2462
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
will be more or less switched off
 

2463
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,710
will be more or less switched off
that's not possible i know but it it

2464
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:58,720
that's not possible i know but it it
 

2465
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,630
that's not possible i know but it it
will not continue everything will happen

2466
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,640
will not continue everything will happen
 

2467
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,550
will not continue everything will happen
in the new uh ethereum 2.0

new chain where at 10

2510
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:51,440
new chain where at 10
 

2511
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,589
new chain where at 10
i guess that around the first of

2512
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:53,599
i guess that around the first of
 

2513
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,710
i guess that around the first of
december this thing

2514
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
december this thing
 

2515
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,390
december this thing
should be filled more or less because

2516
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,400
should be filled more or less because
 

2517
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,990
should be filled more or less because
all the big whales will be coming

2518
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
all the big whales will be coming
 

2519
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,990
all the big whales will be coming
in um into uh staking because they get

2520
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,000
in um into uh staking because they get
 

2521
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,630
in um into uh staking because they get
the rewards are not bad at the beginning

00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,640
the rewards are not bad at the beginning
 

2523
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,750
the rewards are not bad at the beginning
so

2524
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
so
 

2525
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,030
so
this is um ethereum 1.0

2526
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
this is um ethereum 1.0
 

2527
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,750
this is um ethereum 1.0

that to get into these systems that
 

2847
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,270
that to get into these systems that
could be a back door into the network
