had
 

197
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,229

not really good day no and you can't
 

205
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,430
not really good day no and you can't
that's what they say

206
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
that's what they say
 

207
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,390
that's what they say
it's capable of up to not but you're

208
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
it's capable of up to not but you're
 

209
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,190
it's capable of up to not but you're
looking 360 kilobits

210
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
looking 360 kilobits
 

211
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,110
looking 360 kilobits
yeah i like i turned on the internet and

212
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
yeah i like i turned on the internet and
 

213
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,670
yeah i like i turned on the internet and
i almost heard that like

214
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
i almost heard that like
 

215
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,270
i almost heard that like
it was it was bad so now we've got lte

216
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
it was it was bad so now we've got lte
 

217
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,430
it was it was bad so now we've got lte
um and it's costing us significantly

218
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
um and it's costing us significantly
 

219
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,789
um and it's costing us significantly
more and we're getting on a

220
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
more and we're getting on a
 

221
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,309
more and we're getting on a
good day 50 down 25 up

222
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
good day 50 down 25 up
 

223
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,630
good day 50 down 25 up
which is pretty decent but because it's

224
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
which is pretty decent but because it's
 

225
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,910
which is pretty decent but because it's
lte

226
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
lte
 

227
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,550
lte
it's not as reliable for whatever reason

228
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
it's not as reliable for whatever reason
 

229
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:46,949
it's not as reliable for whatever reason
yeah

230
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
yeah
 

231
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,550
yeah
and it probably our internet probably

232
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
and it probably our internet probably
 

233
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,390
and it probably our internet probably
drops off three four times a day

234
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
drops off three four times a day
 

235
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,509
drops off three four times a day
and there's nothing worse than a

236
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
and there's nothing worse than a
 

237
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,030
and there's nothing worse than a
dropping off in the middle of a service

238
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
dropping off in the middle of a service
 

239
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,710
dropping off in the middle of a service
you have like a tower or something set

240
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
you have like a tower or something set
 

241
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,670
you have like a tower or something set
up or

242
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
up or
 

243
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,070
up or
you're just using the inbuilt antenna

244
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
you're just using the inbuilt antenna
 

245
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,990
you're just using the inbuilt antenna
the built-in antenna they

246
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
the built-in antenna they
 

247
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,990
the built-in antenna they
recommended a tower and it was on our

248
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
recommended a tower and it was on our
 

249
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,190
recommended a tower and it was on our
list of things to do and then

250
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
list of things to do and then
 

251
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,030
list of things to do and then
snow hit and i'm like i'm not going on

252
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
snow hit and i'm like i'm not going on
 

253
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,509
snow hit and i'm like i'm not going on
the roof at the old studio studio d

254
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
the roof at the old studio studio d
 

255
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,149
the roof at the old studio studio d
uh we had to use lte for the same reason

256
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
uh we had to use lte for the same reason
 

257
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,589
uh we had to use lte for the same reason
no internet in the area

258
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
no internet in the area
 

259
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,509
no internet in the area
that was a real oversight when we moved

260
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
that was a real oversight when we moved
 

261
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,949
that was a real oversight when we moved
in there

262
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
in there
 

263
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,110
in there
but so what i did to improve the

264
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
but so what i did to improve the
 

265
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,949
but so what i did to improve the
performance was i got a modem

266
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
performance was i got a modem
 

267
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,949
performance was i got a modem
um that had the capability of having an

268
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
um that had the capability of having an
 

269
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,990
um that had the capability of having an
external antenna

270
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
external antenna
 

271
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,870
external antenna
yes has that and it has a bnc connector

272
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
yes has that and it has a bnc connector
 

273
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,550
yes has that and it has a bnc connector
and so i ran a 50-foot bnc cable to

274
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
and so i ran a 50-foot bnc cable to
 

275
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,390
and so i ran a 50-foot bnc cable to
the foyer where i set up a piece of pvc

276
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
the foyer where i set up a piece of pvc
 

277
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,870
the foyer where i set up a piece of pvc
pipe

278
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
pipe
 

279
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,070
pipe
yeah with a yagi antenna pointed

280
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
yeah with a yagi antenna pointed
 

281
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,830
yeah with a yagi antenna pointed
at the tower now i was fortunate because

282
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
at the tower now i was fortunate because
 

283
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,110
at the tower now i was fortunate because
the tower was

284
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
the tower was
 

285
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,030
the tower was
in line of sight from our front window

286
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
in line of sight from our front window
 

287
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,350
in line of sight from our front window
now in in your case you might have to

288
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
now in in your case you might have to
 

289
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,670
now in in your case you might have to
actually extend is it yeah i think it is

290
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
actually extend is it yeah i think it is
 

291
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,469
actually extend is it yeah i think it is
at least from our

292
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
at least from our
 

293
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,830
at least from our
makes a difference man if you use an

294
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
makes a difference man if you use an
 

295
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,590
makes a difference man if you use an
external antenna that's directional and

296
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
external antenna that's directional and
 

297
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,629
external antenna that's directional and
that you can point

298
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
that you can point
 

299
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,070
that you can point
because it's line of sight right you're

300
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
because it's line of sight right you're
 

301
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,670
because it's line of sight right you're
going to get the better signal if you've

302
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
going to get the better signal if you've
 

303
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,189
going to get the better signal if you've
got line of sight if you're

304
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
got line of sight if you're
 

305
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,270
got line of sight if you're
using the built-in antenna you're going

306
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
using the built-in antenna you're going
 

307
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,189
using the built-in antenna you're going
through walls you're going through

308
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
through walls you're going through
 

309
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,670
through walls you're going through
everything to get there and it's up and

310
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
everything to get there and it's up and
 

311
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,189
everything to get there and it's up and
down and the speed is kind of

312
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
down and the speed is kind of
 

313
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,950
down and the speed is kind of
inconsistent depending on

314
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
inconsistent depending on
 

315
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,710
inconsistent depending on
you know where you're standing and that

316
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
you know where you're standing and that
 

317
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,150
you know where you're standing and that
kind of you know how cell phone

318
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
kind of you know how cell phone
 

319
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,990
kind of you know how cell phone
technology is right so so

320
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
technology is right so so
 

321
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,749
technology is right so so
grab one of those they're not expensive

322
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
grab one of those they're not expensive
 

323
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,350
grab one of those they're not expensive
yeah it's like 75 bucks

new kit
 

841
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,030
new kit
from the raspberry pi foundation really

842
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
from the raspberry pi foundation really
 

843
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,629
from the raspberry pi foundation really
excited about this little guy

844
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
excited about this little guy
 

845
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,509

platform
 

859
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,550
platform
for ubuntu that's so that is a very huge

860

they are actually supporting it we're
 

877
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,949
they are actually supporting it we're
going to give it a try tonight to see

878
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
going to give it a try tonight to see
 

879
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,550
going to give it a try tonight to see
how it operates so

880
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
how it operates so
 

881
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,670

if you can use a single board computer

942
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
if you can use a single board computer
 

943
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,670
if you can use a single board computer
in place of a desktop computer

944
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
in place of a desktop computer
 

945
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,829
in place of a desktop computer
what's next right so you could do that

946
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
what's next right so you could do that
 

947
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,150
what's next right so you could do that
and i want to you know i want to be

brutally honest with you i mean it's a
 

951
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,509
brutally honest with you i mean it's a
single board computer still through and

952
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
single board computer still through and
 

953
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:51,990
single board computer still through and
through

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
through
 

955
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,069
through
absolutely but we're talking like it

956
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
absolutely but we're talking like it
 

957
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,629
absolutely but we're talking like it
might have four or eight gigs of ram

958
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
might have four or eight gigs of ram
 

959
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,230
might have four or eight gigs of ram
which is really good for a single board

960
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
which is really good for a single board
 

961
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,470
which is really good for a single board
computer makes for a decent

raspberry pi 400.
 

1061
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,470
raspberry pi 400.
so it is a raspberry pi 4 at its heart

it's been you know they've rearranged
 

1065
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,549
it's been you know they've rearranged
the board in order to make it fit within

this chassis right
and you know it takes me back to

1070
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
and you know it takes me back to
 

1071
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,150
and you know it takes me back to
the kind of mid-80s

1072
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
the kind of mid-80s
 

1073
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,350
the kind of mid-80s
um i guess when i had a vic-20 which was

1074
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
um i guess when i had a vic-20 which was

computer and that's right and like that
 

1079
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,630
computer and that's right and like that
was one of my first computers

1080
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
was one of my first computers
 

1081
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,470
was one of my first computers
and you know you think about the amiga

1082
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
and you know you think about the amiga
 

1083
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,789
and you know you think about the amiga
the commodores and those things that we

the commodores and those things that we
 

1085
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,230
the commodores and those things that we
grew up with

1086
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
grew up with
 

1087
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,630

that
 

1091
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,270
that
there have been projects where people

1092
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
there have been projects where people
 

1093
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,029
there have been projects where people
can 3d print their own

1094

it's sleek it's incredible

1100
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
it's sleek it's incredible
 

1101
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,990
it's sleek it's incredible
it's a little bit um gimmicky in a way

1102
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
it's a little bit um gimmicky in a way
 

1103
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,830
it's a little bit um gimmicky in a way
but yeah if you look at that i think so

1104
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
but yeah if you look at that i think so
 

1105
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,470
but yeah if you look at that i think so
i think so we're going to kind of figure

1106
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
i think so we're going to kind of figure
 

1107
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,630
i think so we're going to kind of figure
that out together tonight

1108
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
that out together tonight
 

1109
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,029
that out together tonight
if you're into that like really sleek

1110
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
if you're into that like really sleek
 

1111
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,350
if you're into that like really sleek
form factor it is literally a keyboard

1112
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
form factor it is literally a keyboard
 

1113
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,669
form factor it is literally a keyboard
that

1114
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
that
 

1115
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,830
that
is the computer if you don't mind the

1116
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
is the computer if you don't mind the
 

1117
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,110
is the computer if you don't mind the
fact that it's got some cables coming

1118
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
fact that it's got some cables coming
 

1119
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,669
fact that it's got some cables coming
out of it

1120
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
out of it
 

1121
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,150
out of it
and uh and you got to set a monitor up

1122
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
and uh and you got to set a monitor up
 

1123
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,750
and uh and you got to set a monitor up
then you're going to do just fine with

1124
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
then you're going to do just fine with
 

1125
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,150
then you're going to do just fine with
this

1126
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
this
 

1127
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,669
this
but it's not like the raspberry pi that

1128
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
but it's not like the raspberry pi that
 

1129
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,190
but it's not like the raspberry pi that
you'll stick on the back of a tv and it

1130
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
you'll stick on the back of a tv and it
 

1131
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,150
you'll stick on the back of a tv and it
just operates

1132
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
just operates
 

1133
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,789
just operates
hidden away this is gonna be on your

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,510
it does not feel like a
a bad keyboard at all i mean if they're

1294
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
a bad keyboard at all i mean if they're
 

1295
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,110
a bad keyboard at all i mean if they're
pretty low profile keys

1296
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
pretty low profile keys
 

1297
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,789
pretty low profile keys
you're not like looking at a mechanical

1298
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
you're not like looking at a mechanical
 

1299
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,710
you're not like looking at a mechanical
keyboard it's more like a

1300
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
keyboard it's more like a
 

1301
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,310
keyboard it's more like a
kind of like a laptop keyboard or

1302
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
kind of like a laptop keyboard or
 

1303
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,510
kind of like a laptop keyboard or
something like that yeah they're not

1304
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
something like that yeah they're not
 

1305
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,710
something like that yeah they're not
clunky which is nice

1306
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
clunky which is nice
 

1307
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,830
clunky which is nice
yeah the cooling on the bottom there is

1308
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
yeah the cooling on the bottom there is
 

1309
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,310
yeah the cooling on the bottom there is
quite significant there's a really large

1310
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
quite significant there's a really large
 

1311
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,750
quite significant there's a really large
heatsink in there that's keeping the

1312
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
heatsink in there that's keeping the
 

1313
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,590
heatsink in there that's keeping the
thing cool so they've overclocked it to

1314
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
thing cool so they've overclocked it to
 

1315
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,669
thing cool so they've overclocked it to
1.8 gigahertz out of the box

1316
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
1.8 gigahertz out of the box
 

1317
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,630
1.8 gigahertz out of the box
oh cool uh which is lovely and as you

1318
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
oh cool uh which is lovely and as you
 

1319

oh cool uh which is lovely and as you
can see

1320
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
can see
 

1321
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,710
can see
just sleek form factor

1322
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
just sleek form factor
 

1323
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,270
just sleek form factor
so it's even smaller than my vic-20 but

1324
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
so it's even smaller than my vic-20 but
 

1325
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,390
so it's even smaller than my vic-20 but
super

1326
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
super
 

1327
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,990
super
super powerful and i it's not

1328
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
super powerful and i it's not
 

1329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,070
super powerful and i it's not
it's not that thick either which is no

1330
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
it's not that thick either which is no
 

1331
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,830
it's not that thick either which is no
that's what i mean like sleek form

1332
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
that's what i mean like sleek form
 

1333
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,190
that's what i mean like sleek form
factor

1334
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
factor
 

1335
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,510
factor
just great i would have thought because

1336
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
just great i would have thought because
 

1337
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,350
just great i would have thought because
i mean you used to the raspberry pi

1338
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
i mean you used to the raspberry pi
 

1339
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,270
i mean you used to the raspberry pi
you know it sits up that high i thought

1340
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
you know it sits up that high i thought
 

1341
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,310
you know it sits up that high i thought
it was going to be a much bigger

1342
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
it was going to be a much bigger
 

1343
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,110
it was going to be a much bigger
keyboard but

1344
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
keyboard but
 

1345
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,510
keyboard but
no they've really they've really shrunk

1346
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
no they've really they've really shrunk
 

1347
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,630
no they've really they've really shrunk
it down that's nice

1348
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
it down that's nice
 

1349
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,430
it down that's nice
yeah yeah um just like a raspberry pi 4

1350
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
yeah yeah um just like a raspberry pi 4
 

1351
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,070
yeah yeah um just like a raspberry pi 4
you've got bluetooth 5 you've got your

1352
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
you've got bluetooth 5 you've got your
 

1353
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,029
you've got bluetooth 5 you've got your
wi-fi gigabit ethernet i'm going to be

1354
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
wi-fi gigabit ethernet i'm going to be
 

1355
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,430
wi-fi gigabit ethernet i'm going to be
using it on wi-fi today

1356
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
using it on wi-fi today
 

1357
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,909
using it on wi-fi today
and it just fires right up and ready to

1358
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
and it just fires right up and ready to
 

1359
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,190
and it just fires right up and ready to
go so should we do that

1360
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
go so should we do that
 

1361
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,070
go so should we do that
absolutely let's fire it up

1363
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,950

well here we are raspberry pi os came

1364
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
well here we are raspberry pi os came
 

1365
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,630
well here we are raspberry pi os came
pre-installed

1366
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
pre-installed
 

1367
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,710
pre-installed
at first boot i had to just kind of go

1368
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
at first boot i had to just kind of go
 

1369
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,789
at first boot i had to just kind of go
through the initial setup process which

1370
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
through the initial setup process which
 

1371
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,149
through the initial setup process which
just got its updates and things like

1372
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
just got its updates and things like
 

1373

1768
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
in its place and this was performing
 

1769
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,950
in its place and this was performing
better

1770
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
better
 

1771
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,549
better
than our one-year-old box yeah so for

1772
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
than our one-year-old box yeah so for
 

1773
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,909
than our one-year-old box yeah so for
multimedia even

1774
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919
multimedia even
 

1775
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,350
multimedia even
it was doing a better job than the

1776
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
it was doing a better job than the
 

1777
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,990
it was doing a better job than the
android box and i think that

1778
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
android box and i think that
 

1779
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,669
android box and i think that
the the family can really appreciate it

1780
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
the the family can really appreciate it
 

1781
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,350
the the family can really appreciate it
a little more because

1782
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
a little more because
 

1783
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,990
a little more because
uh the form like the kind of the the way

1784
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
uh the form like the kind of the the way
 

1785
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,630
uh the form like the kind of the the way
that it

1786
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:58,640
that it
 

1787
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,269
that it
the i guess the desktop paradigm is more

1788
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
the i guess the desktop paradigm is more
 

1789
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,590
the i guess the desktop paradigm is more
like a computer than an android tv

1790
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
like a computer than an android tv
 

1791
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,590
like a computer than an android tv
so you're actually using an interface

1792
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
so you're actually using an interface
 

1793
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,110
so you're actually using an interface
that where you're bringing up a browser

1794
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
that where you're bringing up a browser
 

1795
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,830
that where you're bringing up a browser
and you're

1796
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
and you're
 

1797
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,389
and you're
able to install applications and linux

1798
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
able to install applications and linux
 

1799
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,070
able to install applications and linux
software and things like that so

1800
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
software and things like that so
 

1801
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,830
software and things like that so
it is a really robust system works great

1802
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840
it is a really robust system works great
 

1803
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,950
it is a really robust system works great
um i mean that's

1804
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:18,960
um i mean that's
 

1805
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,630
um i mean that's
that's really all there is to it right

1806
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
that's really all there is to it right
 

1807
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,070
that's really all there is to it right
like does it work yeah

1808
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
like does it work yeah
 

1809
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,990
like does it work yeah
it is a raspberry pi 4 though so if i

1810
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
it is a raspberry pi 4 though so if i
 

1811
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,750
it is a raspberry pi 4 though so if i
was going to use this as a set top box i

1812
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:25,760
was going to use this as a set top box i
 

1813
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,509
was going to use this as a set top box i
would just go with a raspberry pi 4

1814
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,519
would just go with a raspberry pi 4
 

1815
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,630
would just go with a raspberry pi 4
right overclock it to 1.8 gigahertz to

1816
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
right overclock it to 1.8 gigahertz to
 

1817
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,070
right overclock it to 1.8 gigahertz to
match the speed of this

1818
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
match the speed of this
 

1819
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,990
match the speed of this
um and and that's not really a selling

1820
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,000
um and and that's not really a selling
 

1821
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,909
um and and that's not really a selling
point remember that overclocking can be

1822
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
point remember that overclocking can be
 

1823
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,710
point remember that overclocking can be
done anyways

1824
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
done anyways
 

1825
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,630
done anyways
so whether you have a raspberry pi 4 at

1826
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
so whether you have a raspberry pi 4 at
 

1827
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,310
so whether you have a raspberry pi 4 at
1.5 gigahertz

1828
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320
1.5 gigahertz
 

1829
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,830
1.5 gigahertz
or a raspberry pi 400 at 1.8

1830
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
or a raspberry pi 400 at 1.8
 

1831
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,149
or a raspberry pi 400 at 1.8
it looks like a selling feature on paper

1832
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:46,159
it looks like a selling feature on paper
 

1833
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,070
it looks like a selling feature on paper
but it's just a setting in the operating

1834
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
but it's just a setting in the operating
 

1835
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,549
but it's just a setting in the operating
system

1836
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559
system
 

1837
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,870
system
so you can take that raspberry pi 4 and

1838
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
so you can take that raspberry pi 4 and
 

1839
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,350
so you can take that raspberry pi 4 and
bump it up to 1.8 as well so

1840
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360
bump it up to 1.8 as well so
 

1841
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,190
bump it up to 1.8 as well so
pretty clever marketing i must say

1842
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
pretty clever marketing i must say
 

1843
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,870
pretty clever marketing i must say
because those who don't understand

1844
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
because those who don't understand
 

1845
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,549
because those who don't understand
how overclocking works will think this

1846
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:58,559
how overclocking works will think this
 

1847
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,389
how overclocking works will think this
is faster well it's not

1848
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
is faster well it's not
 

1849
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,509
is faster well it's not
it's the exact same soc so

1850
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
it's the exact same soc so
 

1851
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,149
it's the exact same soc so
all right let's jump back over so i mean

1852
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
all right let's jump back over so i mean
 

1853
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,070
all right let's jump back over so i mean
all in all i'm pretty impressed with it

1854
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
all in all i'm pretty impressed with it
 

1855
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,230
all in all i'm pretty impressed with it
i like it as i mentioned it's a little

1856
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:10,240
i like it as i mentioned it's a little
 

1857
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,909
i like it as i mentioned it's a little
bit on the gimmicky side but i'm

1858
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
bit on the gimmicky side but i'm
 

1859
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,990
bit on the gimmicky side but i'm
old school and i like that kind of a

1860
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,000
old school and i like that kind of a
 

1861
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,950
old school and i like that kind of a
gimmick well

1862
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
gimmick well
 

1863
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,870
gimmick well
i mean for for me like i'm looking at

1864
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
i mean for for me like i'm looking at
 

1865
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,230
i mean for for me like i'm looking at
that and i'm going

1866
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
that and i'm going
 

1867
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,350
that and i'm going
that would make especially with this

1868
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
that would make especially with this
 

1869
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,750
that would make especially with this
you know manual yeah that would make a

1870
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:23,760
you know manual yeah that would make a
 

1871
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,590
you know manual yeah that would make a
great christmas gift

1872
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
great christmas gift
 

1873
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,149
great christmas gift
for the kids because like our especially

00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:28,159
for the kids because like our especially
 

1875
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,750
for the kids because like our especially
with you know one of my boys who really

1876
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
with you know one of my boys who really
 

1877
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,269
with you know one of my boys who really
wants to get into programming

1878
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:31,279
wants to get into programming
 

1879
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,630
wants to get into programming
savannah's been doing that for a couple

1880
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
savannah's been doing that for a couple
 

1881
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,630
savannah's been doing that for a couple
years going back to that uh the ciggy

1882
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
years going back to that uh the ciggy
 

1883
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,830
years going back to that uh the ciggy
that she had

1884
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:35,840
that she had
 

1885
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,710
that she had
uh from smart girls this is a robot yeah

1886
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
uh from smart girls this is a robot yeah
 

1887
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,669
uh from smart girls this is a robot yeah
um

1888
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:39,679
um
 

1889
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,190
um
so i mean something like that that would

1890
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
so i mean something like that that would
 

1891
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,789
so i mean something like that that would
be cool you know buy them a monitor and

1892
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:42,799
be cool you know buy them a monitor and
 

1893
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,590
be cool you know buy them a monitor and
a

1894
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
a
 

1895
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,509
a
you know the raspberry pi just connect

1896
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:45,519
you know the raspberry pi just connect
 

1897
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,269
you know the raspberry pi just connect
it to the tv well yeah you can do that

1898
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
it to the tv well yeah you can do that
 

1899
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,549
it to the tv well yeah you can do that
and that's the nice thing too is that it

1900
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
and that's the nice thing too is that it
 

1901
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,669
and that's the nice thing too is that it
because of the form factor you can just

1902
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
because of the form factor you can just
 

1903
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,870
because of the form factor you can just
disconnect it and put it away when

1904
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
disconnect it and put it away when
 

1905
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,750
disconnect it and put it away when
you're not using it

1906
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
you're not using it
 

1907
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,669
you're not using it
pull it out put it on the on the tv

1908
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:53,679
pull it out put it on the on the tv
 

1909
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,350
pull it out put it on the on the tv
whatever you want to do yeah so yeah i

1910
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,360
whatever you want to do yeah so yeah i
 

1911
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,669
whatever you want to do yeah so yeah i
think it's it's definitely got its place

1912
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
think it's it's definitely got its place
 

1913
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,830
think it's it's definitely got its place
yes um is it for you that's really you

1914
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
yes um is it for you that's really you
 

1915
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,909
yes um is it for you that's really you
know it's a case-by-case thing so

1916
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
know it's a case-by-case thing so
 

1917
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,549
know it's a case-by-case thing so
uh but i've taken a look at it i like it

1918
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
uh but i've taken a look at it i like it
 

1919
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,669
uh but i've taken a look at it i like it
um i think it's

1920
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
um i think it's
 

1921
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,830
um i think it's
it's actually making a really nice kiosk

1922
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
it's actually making a really nice kiosk
 

1923

um they did a historical snapshot 10th

2708
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:32,480
um they did a historical snapshot 10th
 

2709
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,790
um they did a historical snapshot 10th
of december 2017.

2710
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
of december 2017.

bitcoin went up in seven days 34

2712
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,000
bitcoin went up in seven days 34
 

2713
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,510
bitcoin went up in seven days 34
most of the other coins as you can see

2714
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:39,520
most of the other coins as you can see
 

2715
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,150
most of the other coins as you can see
are in red so they went down

2716
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
are in red so they went down
 

2717
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,950
are in red so they went down
so there was no correlation at that time

2718
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:44,960
so there was no correlation at that time
 

2719
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,470
so there was no correlation at that time
that significant between

2720
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
that significant between
 

2721
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,710

so bitcoin was at 15 000 and ethereum at
 

2727
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,349
so bitcoin was at 15 000 and ethereum at

and uh what i find encouraging at the
 

2803
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,470
and uh what i find encouraging at the
moment is that this bull market that

2804
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
moment is that this bull market that
 

2805
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,069

global basis
in 2018 that was 100 percent equivalent

2828
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,200
in 2018 that was 100 percent equivalent
 

2829
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,549
in 2018 that was 100 percent equivalent
to 100 percent
