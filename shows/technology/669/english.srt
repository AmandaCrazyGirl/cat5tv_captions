to print a sheet of 40 of them

338
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
to print a sheet of 40 of them

341
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,070
well yeah so if i was sitting in front
of my 3d printer and wanted to print one

342
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
of my 3d printer and wanted to print one
 

343
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,950
of my 3d printer and wanted to print one
at a time sure

344
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
at a time sure
 

345
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,629
at a time sure
yeah i could probably save some time

346
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
yeah i could probably save some time
 

347
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,710
yeah i could probably save some time
well i just didn't know if like

348
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
well i just didn't know if like
 

349
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,790
well i just didn't know if like
i've never 3d printed before so i just

350
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
i've never 3d printed before so i just
 

351
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,990
i've never 3d printed before so i just
didn't know if you could like

352
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
didn't know if you could like
 

353
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,670
didn't know if you could like
print one here and then two inches over

354
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
print one here and then two inches over
 

355
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,189
print one here and then two inches over
print another one or does it all still

356
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
print another one or does it all still
 

357
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,670
print another one or does it all still
link it

358
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
link it
 

359
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,270
link it
you could but with these jeff they're so

360
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
you could but with these jeff they're so
 

361
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,430
you could but with these jeff they're so
they're so fine that there's not a lot

362
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
they're so fine that there's not a lot
 

363
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,870
they're so fine that there's not a lot
of surface to touch the

364
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
of surface to touch the
 

365
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,430
of surface to touch the
the platform of the 3d printer oh so

366
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
the platform of the 3d printer oh so
 

367
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,710
the platform of the 3d printer oh so
what ends up happening is you get

368
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
what ends up happening is you get
 

369
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,230
what ends up happening is you get
halfway through the print and it

370
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
halfway through the print and it
 

371
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,390
halfway through the print and it
loses its adhesion so it's no longer

372
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
loses its adhesion so it's no longer
 

373
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,150
loses its adhesion so it's no longer
stuck to the printer and so then as the

374
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
stuck to the printer and so then as the
 

375
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,670
stuck to the printer and so then as the
printhead is going over it

376
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
printhead is going over it
 

377
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,309
printhead is going over it
it moves it and then you've got a

378
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
it moves it and then you've got a
 

379
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,070
it moves it and then you've got a
botched print so that's where this

380
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
botched print so that's where this
 

381
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,070
botched print so that's where this
sheet comes in which is actually called

382
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
sheet comes in which is actually called
 

383
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,510
sheet comes in which is actually called
a i guess a skirt or something like that

384
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
a i guess a skirt or something like that
 

385
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,070
a i guess a skirt or something like that
but it basically gives you more surface

386
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
but it basically gives you more surface
 

387
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,790
but it basically gives you more surface
area

388
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
area
 

389
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,430
area
to adhere to the 3d printer makes sense

390
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
to adhere to the 3d printer makes sense
 

391
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,309
to adhere to the 3d printer makes sense
but yes

392
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
but yes
 

393
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,990

i mean if you really really dialed in
 

395
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,510
i mean if you really really dialed in
that 3d printer that's

396
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
that 3d printer that's
 

397
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,990
that 3d printer that's
you know maybe a goal to to be able to

um and dealt with like sort of
 

1257
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,310
um and dealt with like sort of
everything from the desktop application

1258
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
everything from the desktop application
 

1259
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,870
everything from the desktop application
back to the data center you know uh so

1260
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
back to the data center you know uh so
 

1261
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,590
back to the data center you know uh so
if you break a bottleneck at the desktop

1262
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
if you break a bottleneck at the desktop
 

1263
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,270
if you break a bottleneck at the desktop
you know then your next bottleneck is

1264
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
you know then your next bottleneck is
 

1265
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,789
you know then your next bottleneck is
the network and once you break that then

1266
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
the network and once you break that then
 

1267
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,789
the network and once you break that then
your bottleneck is on the server

1268
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
your bottleneck is on the server
 

1269
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,029
your bottleneck is on the server
and so um just basically trying to

troubleshoot and
 

1273
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,470
troubleshoot and
and break bottlenecks whether it's you

1274
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
and break bottlenecks whether it's you
 

1275
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,750
and break bottlenecks whether it's you
know uh

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,750
that
uh they all need uh big fast data going

1284
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760
uh they all need uh big fast data going
 

1285
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,470
uh they all need uh big fast data going
through pipes

1286
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
through pipes
 

1287
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,590
through pipes
don't i know it don't i know it oh yeah

1288
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
don't i know it don't i know it oh yeah
 

1289
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,070
don't i know it don't i know it oh yeah
so you've seen that's quite a setup you

1290
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
so you've seen that's quite a setup you
 

1291
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,830
so you've seen that's quite a setup you
yeah well and you've seen our file

1292
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
yeah well and you've seen our file
 

1293
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,710
yeah well and you've seen our file
numbers from

1294
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
numbers from
 

1295
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,230
numbers from
our test today um and i i do realize

1296
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
our test today um and i i do realize
 

1297
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,750
our test today um and i i do realize
that those numbers are

1298
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
that those numbers are
 

1299
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,789
that those numbers are
slightly arbitrary um however

1300
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
slightly arbitrary um however
 

1301
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,789
slightly arbitrary um however
what i did is i ran the same tests

1302
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
what i did is i ran the same tests
 

1303
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,470
what i did is i ran the same tests
against the same scenario

1304
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
against the same scenario
 

1305
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,470
against the same scenario
on our old spinning drives as i did on

1306
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:01,480
on our old spinning drives as i did on
 

1307
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,029
on our old spinning drives as i did on
dc500rs

1308
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
dc500rs
 

1309
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,950
dc500rs
so just looking at those numbers can you

1310
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
so just looking at those numbers can you
 

1311
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,549
so just looking at those numbers can you
help us to make sense of

1312
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
help us to make sense of
 

1313
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,590
help us to make sense of
what's what's actually happening there

1314
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
what's what's actually happening there
 

1315
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,029
what's what's actually happening there
uh okay yeah so uh you know

1316
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
uh okay yeah so uh you know
 

1317
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,990
uh okay yeah so uh you know
first of all both you know both the ssds

1318
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
first of all both you know both the ssds
 

1319
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,510
first of all both you know both the ssds
and the hard drives are

1320
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
and the hard drives are
 

1321
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,149
and the hard drives are
connected to the sata bus right same

1322
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
connected to the sata bus right same
 

1323
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:20,710
connected to the sata bus right same
server

1324
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720

1325
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,070
server
all the hardware is the same just the

1326
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
all the hardware is the same just the
 

1327
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,110
all the hardware is the same just the
drives have changed yeah

1328
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
drives have changed yeah
 

1329
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,789
drives have changed yeah
the sata bus is one of the older um

1330
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
the sata bus is one of the older um
 

1331
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,430
the sata bus is one of the older um

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,789
uh and and it has uh you know
a few uh uh weaknesses and that uh

1338
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
a few uh uh weaknesses and that uh
 

1339
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,870
a few uh uh weaknesses and that uh
sort of you can only be reading or

1340
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
sort of you can only be reading or
 

1341
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,190
sort of you can only be reading or
writing to it at any one time

1342
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
writing to it at any one time
 

1343
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,270
writing to it at any one time
uh but you know with raid controllers

1344
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
uh but you know with raid controllers
 

1345
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,870
uh but you know with raid controllers
and that they've gotten really good at

1346
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
and that they've gotten really good at
 

1347
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,789
and that they've gotten really good at
being able to optimize that

1348
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
being able to optimize that
 

1349
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,029
being able to optimize that
uh the best way possible so then you

1350
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
uh the best way possible so then you
 

1351
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,310
uh the best way possible so then you
come down to the uh

1352
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
come down to the uh
 

1353
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,510
come down to the uh
raw you know uh interface

1354
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,520
raw you know uh interface
 

1355
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,270
raw you know uh interface
differences between a hard drive

1356
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280

spinning disk and ssds
 

1359
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,710
spinning disk and ssds
and you know s's

1360
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
and you know s's
 

1361
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,710
and you know s's
ssds have been modified you know it's a

1362
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
ssds have been modified you know it's a
 

1363
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,110
ssds have been modified you know it's a
solid-state disk it's basically you've

1364
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
solid-state disk it's basically you've
 

1365
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,990
solid-state disk it's basically you've
got computer memory nand that is

1366
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
got computer memory nand that is
 

1367
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,950
got computer memory nand that is
being uh routed to speak uh disk

1368
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960
being uh routed to speak uh disk
 

1369
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,710
being uh routed to speak uh disk
language right

1370
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
language right
 

1371
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,549
language right
and so uh in a way you're sort of uh

1372
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
and so uh in a way you're sort of uh
 

1373
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,750
and so uh in a way you're sort of uh
hobbling the uh the uh fast nan that's

1374
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
hobbling the uh the uh fast nan that's
 

1375
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,310
hobbling the uh the uh fast nan that's
in there by

1376
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
in there by
 

1377
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,669
in there by
making it go through the uh uh sata

1378
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
making it go through the uh uh sata
 

1379
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,310
making it go through the uh uh sata

00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
but uh it has to pretend that it is
 

1383
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,149
but uh it has to pretend that it is
uh it has to like at least translate to

1384
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
uh it has to like at least translate to
 

1385
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,669
uh it has to like at least translate to
speak disc language

1386
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
speak disc language
 

1387
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,510
speak disc language
so when you've got like uh the old

1388
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
so when you've got like uh the old
 

1389
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,909
so when you've got like uh the old
school heart spinning discard drives

1390
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
school heart spinning discard drives
 

1391
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,149
school heart spinning discard drives
um you know they're they're pretty good

1392
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
um you know they're they're pretty good
 

1393
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,230
um you know they're they're pretty good
at doing sequential stuff

1394
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
at doing sequential stuff
 

1395
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,950
at doing sequential stuff
uh random they start choking and when it

1396
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
uh random they start choking and when it
 

1397
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,630
uh random they start choking and when it
comes to iops

1398
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
comes to iops
 

1399
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,470
comes to iops
they really have a hard time keeping up

1400
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
they really have a hard time keeping up
 

1401
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,909
they really have a hard time keeping up
with uh

1402
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
with uh
 

1403
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,310
with uh
the memory you can see you know which

1404
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
the memory you can see you know which
 

1405
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,190
the memory you can see you know which
parts are

1406
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
parts are
 

1407
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,990
parts are
uh and the difference between your test

1408
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
uh and the difference between your test
 

1409
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,710

scores
 

1411
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,350
scores
you can see which parts are you know low

1412
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
you can see which parts are you know low
 

1413
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,070
you can see which parts are you know low
because

1414
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
because
 

1415
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,950
because
of the spinning disc itself and ones

1416
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:04,960
of the spinning disc itself and ones
 

1417
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,750
of the spinning disc itself and ones
that you know

1418
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
that you know
 

1419
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,789
that you know
uh uh are like the uh

1420
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
uh uh are like the uh
 

1421
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,110

um you know the ssds are

1434
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
um you know the ssds are
 

1435
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,909
um you know the ssds are
anywhere between like on the read

1436

anywhere between like on the read
 

1437

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
have going
 

1443
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,669
have going
right um this is also you're doing raid

1444
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
right um this is also you're doing raid
 

1445
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,350
right um this is also you're doing raid
5 so there's a little bit of overhead

1446
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
5 so there's a little bit of overhead
 

1447
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,950
5 so there's a little bit of overhead
with disk management so

1448
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
with disk management so
 

1449
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,710
with disk management so
if you did raid 0 on both the ssds and

1450
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
if you did raid 0 on both the ssds and
 

1451
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,990
if you did raid 0 on both the ssds and
i need redundancy yeah yeah you have no

1452
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
i need redundancy yeah yeah you have no
 

1453
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,750
i need redundancy yeah yeah you have no
redundancy but if you do raid zero you

1454
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
redundancy but if you do raid zero you
 

1455
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,149
redundancy but if you do raid zero you
know then you can see raw bandwidth sure

1456
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
know then you can see raw bandwidth sure
 

1457
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,789
know then you can see raw bandwidth sure
happening right yeah uh but and and that

1458
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
happening right yeah uh but and and that
 

1459
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,510
happening right yeah uh but and and that
that's when

1460
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
that's when
 

1461
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,070
that's when
ssds would even take a step above you

1462
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
ssds would even take a step above you
 

1463
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,630
ssds would even take a step above you
know sad

1464
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
know sad
 

1465
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,750
know sad
ssds would be even faster uh without

1466
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
ssds would be even faster uh without
 

1467
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,070
ssds would be even faster uh without
that

1468
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
that
 

1469
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,149
that
redundancy happening uh because there's

1470
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159
redundancy happening uh because there's
 

1471
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,430
redundancy happening uh because there's
a certain amount of uh

1472
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
a certain amount of uh
 

1473
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,430
a certain amount of uh
overhead that's happening to to do that

1474
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
overhead that's happening to to do that
 

1475
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,909
overhead that's happening to to do that
but uh even with your raid 5 setup

1476
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
but uh even with your raid 5 setup
 

1477
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,070
but uh even with your raid 5 setup
you're still looking at about three

1478
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
you're still looking at about three
 

1479
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,029
you're still looking at about three
times faster

1480
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
times faster
 

1481
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,390
times faster
for ssds than hard drives uh

1482
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,400
for ssds than hard drives uh
 

1483
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,510
for ssds than hard drives uh
on uh on a re on a

1484
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
on uh on a re on a
 

1485
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,630
on uh on a re on a
right and four times faster on the reed

1486
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
right and four times faster on the reed
 

1487
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,350
right and four times faster on the reed
uh typically but the the one sort of

1488
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
uh typically but the the one sort of
 

1489
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,110
uh typically but the the one sort of
secret place that it ends up being much

1490
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
secret place that it ends up being much
 

1491
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,990
secret place that it ends up being much
much faster

1492
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
much faster
 

1493
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,669
much faster
is uh in the latency so that's like the

1494
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
is uh in the latency so that's like the
 

1495
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:27,990
is uh in the latency so that's like the
time

1496
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000

1497
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,070

00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
that uh it actually starts happening
 

1503
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,590
that uh it actually starts happening
right um

1504
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
right um
 

1505
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,750
right um
if if if it's like a random io uh

1506
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
if if if it's like a random io uh
 

1507
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,350
if if if it's like a random io uh
event it might be you know uh

1508
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
event it might be you know uh
 

1509
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,789
event it might be you know uh
when your drives are warmed up and

1510
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
when your drives are warmed up and
 

1511
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,950
when your drives are warmed up and

everything it might be uh
 

1513
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,029
everything it might be uh
like 0.8 milliseconds to 1.2

00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:49,039
like 0.8 milliseconds to 1.2
 

1515
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,710
like 0.8 milliseconds to 1.2
milliseconds depending

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
milliseconds depending
 

1517
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,909
milliseconds depending
uh whereas on the ssd it's going to be

1518
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
uh whereas on the ssd it's going to be
 

1519
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,830
uh whereas on the ssd it's going to be
microseconds so even if it's 20

1520
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
microseconds so even if it's 20
 

1521
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,110
microseconds so even if it's 20
microseconds

1522
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
microseconds
 

1523
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,750
microseconds
uh and you have a rate of four drives if

1524
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
uh and you have a rate of four drives if
 

1525
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,909
uh and you have a rate of four drives if
you say that your average latency per

1526
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
you say that your average latency per
 

1527
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,750
you say that your average latency per
drive was one millisecond on a hard

1528
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
drive was one millisecond on a hard
 

1529
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,549
drive was one millisecond on a hard
drive

1530
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
drive
 

1531
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,070
drive
and it's like 20 microseconds on the ssd

1532
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
and it's like 20 microseconds on the ssd
 

1533
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,070
and it's like 20 microseconds on the ssd
then uh you haven't even gotten to a

1534
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
then uh you haven't even gotten to a
 

1535
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,070
then uh you haven't even gotten to a
microsecond by the time you add up that

1536
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
microsecond by the time you add up that
 

1537
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,190
microsecond by the time you add up that
latency

1538
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
latency
 

1539
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,190
latency
across the four drives

1540
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200

 

1541
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,190

the latency is a big difference and then

1542
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
the latency is a big difference and then
 

1543
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,710
the latency is a big difference and then
the quality of service

1544
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
the quality of service
 

1545
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,710
the quality of service
so one of the things that we really

1546
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
so one of the things that we really
 

1547
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,470
so one of the things that we really
tested the data center the dc

1548
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
tested the data center the dc
 

1549
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,310
tested the data center the dc
500 and 450 and dc 1000 drives

1550
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
500 and 450 and dc 1000 drives
 

1551
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,630
500 and 450 and dc 1000 drives
uh they're they're tested extensively

1552
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
uh they're they're tested extensively
 

1553
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,909
uh they're they're tested extensively
for you know

1554
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
for you know
 

1555
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,710
for you know
uh quality of service that's the main

1556
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
uh quality of service that's the main
 

1557
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,149
uh quality of service that's the main
the main thing you're looking for if

1558
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
the main thing you're looking for if
 

1559
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,710
the main thing you're looking for if
you're putting them into a data center

1560
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
you're putting them into a data center
 

1561
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,350
you're putting them into a data center
like tier 2 cloud something like that

1562
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
like tier 2 cloud something like that
 

1563
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,149
like tier 2 cloud something like that
you want a quality of service where

1564
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
you want a quality of service where
 

1565
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,390
you want a quality of service where
you know a consumer ssd might peak and

1566
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
you know a consumer ssd might peak and
 

1567
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,470
you know a consumer ssd might peak and
deliver super performance for a short

1568
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
deliver super performance for a short
 

1569
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,669
deliver super performance for a short
period of time

1570
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
period of time
 

1571
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,350
period of time
and if you're only transferring a couple

1572
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
and if you're only transferring a couple
 

1573
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,190
and if you're only transferring a couple
gigs at a time that's what you want it's

1574
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
gigs at a time that's what you want it's
 

1575
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,070
gigs at a time that's what you want it's
on your laptop

1576
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
on your laptop
 

1577
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,110
on your laptop
right you know you're trying to get

1578
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
right you know you're trying to get
 

1579
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,549
right you know you're trying to get
things on and off really quick that's

1580
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
things on and off really quick that's
 

1581
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,350
things on and off really quick that's
awesome

1582
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
awesome
 

1583
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,310
awesome
but if you're if you're running a drive

1584
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
but if you're if you're running a drive
 

1585
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,110
but if you're if you're running a drive
you know 24 7 with a database with for

1586
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
you know 24 7 with a database with for
 

1587
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,870
you know 24 7 with a database with for
online transactions

1588
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
online transactions
 

1589
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,789
online transactions
uh you're writing to it and reading from

1590
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
uh you're writing to it and reading from
 

1591
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,950
uh you're writing to it and reading from
it like constantly

1592
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
it like constantly
 

1593
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,669
it like constantly
and you you don't want to see big spikes

1594
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
and you you don't want to see big spikes
 

1595
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,269
and you you don't want to see big spikes
up or down in the performance you want

1596
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
up or down in the performance you want
 

1597
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:13,909
up or down in the performance you want
to see

1598
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
to see
 

1599
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,549
to see
like a a really flat line in that

1600
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
like a a really flat line in that
 

1601
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,830
like a a really flat line in that
performance and

1602
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
performance and
 

1603
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,430
performance and
and you'll see that with like a hard

1604
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
and you'll see that with like a hard
 

1605
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,070
and you'll see that with like a hard
drive you know uh it'll spike up really

1606
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
drive you know uh it'll spike up really
 

1607
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,750
drive you know uh it'll spike up really
fast initially because it's got a big

1608
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
fast initially because it's got a big
 

1609
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,549
fast initially because it's got a big
dram cat

1610
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
dram cat
 

1611
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,549
dram cat
anytime you're transferring a video file

1612
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:26,559
anytime you're transferring a video file
 

1613
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,470
anytime you're transferring a video file
or something it's like fast and then

1614
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
or something it's like fast and then
 

1615
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,510
or something it's like fast and then
and then it'll plummet down to

1616
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
and then it'll plummet down to
 

1617
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,190
and then it'll plummet down to
right 200 megabytes per second and then

1618
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
right 200 megabytes per second and then
 

1619
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,870
right 200 megabytes per second and then
it goes 30 megabytes yes

1620
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
it goes 30 megabytes yes
 

1621
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,430
it goes 30 megabytes yes
and you're like what happened yeah uh

1622
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
and you're like what happened yeah uh
 

1623
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,630
and you're like what happened yeah uh
and the problem is

1624
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
and the problem is
 

1625
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,470
and the problem is
at a certain point you're running out of

1626
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
at a certain point you're running out of
 

1627
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,350
at a certain point you're running out of
cash or something like that so

1628
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
cash or something like that so
 

1629
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,470
cash or something like that so
in that uh you know in in your fios

1630
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
in that uh you know in in your fios
 

1631
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,350
in that uh you know in in your fios
script

1632

1633
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,269

uh one of the important things to do if

1634
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:49,279
uh one of the important things to do if
 

1635
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,870
uh one of the important things to do if
you're wanting to test for

1636
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880
you're wanting to test for
 

1637
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,909
you're wanting to test for
data center use is to do that uh warm up

1638
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
data center use is to do that uh warm up
 

1639
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,389
data center use is to do that uh warm up
on the drive to have it burned in

1640
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
on the drive to have it burned in
 

1641
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,630
on the drive to have it burned in
so that uh it's not just like fresh out

1642
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
so that uh it's not just like fresh out
 

1643
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,510
so that uh it's not just like fresh out
of the box i just

1644
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
of the box i just
 

1645
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,870
of the box i just
installed it and all the sectors are

1646
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
installed it and all the sectors are
 

1647
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,110
installed it and all the sectors are
blank and and you know like uh

1648
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
blank and and you know like uh
 

1649
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,110
blank and and you know like uh
because it's not having to have any

1650
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
because it's not having to have any
 

1651
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,549
because it's not having to have any
overhead of managing

1652
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
overhead of managing
 

1653
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,950
overhead of managing
uh data on the drive right you would see

1654
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960
uh data on the drive right you would see
 

1655
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,590
uh data on the drive right you would see
what the

1656
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
what the
 

1657
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,470
what the
drives in use so is that is that kind of

1658
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
drives in use so is that is that kind of
 

1659
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,149
drives in use so is that is that kind of
the key difference between the consumer

1660
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
the key difference between the consumer
 

1661
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,710
the key difference between the consumer
ssds that i have in my laptop in my home

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
versus these data center drives yeah
 

1667
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,669
versus these data center drives yeah
that and you might see over provisioning

1668
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
that and you might see over provisioning
 

1669
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,710
that and you might see over provisioning
differences

1670
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
differences
 

1671
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,149
differences
um like our uh dc

1672
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159
um like our uh dc
 

1673
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,149
um like our uh dc
uh drives um number one they have a

1674
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159
uh drives um number one they have a
 

1675
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,510
uh drives um number one they have a
decent amount of uh dram cash on them

1676
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
decent amount of uh dram cash on them
 

1677
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,909
decent amount of uh dram cash on them
uh where a lot of consumer drives might

1678
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
uh where a lot of consumer drives might
 

1679
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,269
uh where a lot of consumer drives might
have

1680
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
have
 

1681
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,710
have
a pseudo slc where they take tlc or qlc

1682
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
a pseudo slc where they take tlc or qlc
 

1683
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,549
a pseudo slc where they take tlc or qlc
memory and program it as

1684
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
memory and program it as
 

1685
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,029
memory and program it as
slc so rather than you know they might

1686
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
slc so rather than you know they might
 

1687
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,990
slc so rather than you know they might
take a sector

1688
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
take a sector
 

1689
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,149
take a sector
a section of the drive and and say this

1690
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
a section of the drive and and say this
 

1691
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,669
a section of the drive and and say this
is going to be programmed as

1692
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:51,679
is going to be programmed as
 

1693
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,470
is going to be programmed as
slc so i'm only going to store one bit

1694
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480
slc so i'm only going to store one bit
 

1695
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,310
slc so i'm only going to store one bit
of data in this cell

1696
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
of data in this cell
 

1697
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,230
of data in this cell
instead of the three or four like if

1698
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
instead of the three or four like if
 

1699
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,470
instead of the three or four like if
it's uh tlc you're storing three bits of

1700
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
it's uh tlc you're storing three bits of
 

1701
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,430
it's uh tlc you're storing three bits of
data

1702
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,440
data
 

1703
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,870
data
and uh or bytes and and uh

1704
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
and uh or bytes and and uh
 

1705
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,990
and uh or bytes and and uh
and qlc you're storing four so you've

1706
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
and qlc you're storing four so you've
 

1707
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,789
and qlc you're storing four so you've
got much more

1708
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
got much more
 

1709
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,950
got much more
data that's being stored there uh you

1710
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:10,960
data that's being stored there uh you
 

1711
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,230
data that's being stored there uh you
know we had mlc

1712
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
know we had mlc
 

1713
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,669
know we had mlc
uh but then it was tlc and yeah qlc and

1714
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
uh but then it was tlc and yeah qlc and
 

1715
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,230
uh but then it was tlc and yeah qlc and
you know we're we're trying to clam more

1716
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
you know we're we're trying to clam more
 

1717
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,350
you know we're we're trying to clam more
more bits into

1718
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
more bits into
 

1719
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,549
more bits into
uh uh the more cells uh

1720
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
uh uh the more cells uh
 

1721
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,350
uh uh the more cells uh
and as you do that it gets you know it

1722
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
and as you do that it gets you know it
 

1723
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,430
and as you do that it gets you know it
takes a little longer to program

1724
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
takes a little longer to program
 

1725
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,630
takes a little longer to program
uh all those uh bytes and bits into

1726
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
uh all those uh bytes and bits into
 

1727
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,510
uh all those uh bytes and bits into
uh the different cells so if you use

1728
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
uh the different cells so if you use
 

1729
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,510
uh the different cells so if you use
this pseudo cache of slc

1730
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
this pseudo cache of slc
 

1731
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,430
this pseudo cache of slc
which we do on a few drives as well in

1732
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
which we do on a few drives as well in
 

1733
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,070
which we do on a few drives as well in
consumer uh but uh

1734
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
consumer uh but uh
 

1735
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,230
consumer uh but uh
you're it the reason you do it is it's

1736
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
you're it the reason you do it is it's
 

1737
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,230
you're it the reason you do it is it's
much less expensive than using

1738
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
much less expensive than using
 

1739
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,149
much less expensive than using
dram and so uh on our on our data center

1740
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
dram and so uh on our on our data center
 

1741
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,909
dram and so uh on our on our data center
drives there they all have like a nice

1742
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
drives there they all have like a nice
 

1743
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,549
drives there they all have like a nice
big

1744
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559
big
 

1745
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,549
big
dram cache on them that's one of the big

1746
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
dram cache on them that's one of the big
 

1747
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,870
dram cache on them that's one of the big
differences oh okay

1748
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
differences oh okay
 

1749
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,950
differences oh okay
and so uh that that combined with

1750
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
and so uh that that combined with
 

1751
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,389
and so uh that that combined with
uh the over provisioning that is on

1752
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
uh the over provisioning that is on
 

1753
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,430
uh the over provisioning that is on
uh our data center drives allows for

1754
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440
uh our data center drives allows for
 

1755
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,549
uh our data center drives allows for
uh as well as tweaks in the firmware

1756
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
uh as well as tweaks in the firmware
 

1757
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,510
uh as well as tweaks in the firmware
it allows for really uh high level of

1758
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
it allows for really uh high level of
 

1759
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,950
it allows for really uh high level of
quality of service so

1760
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
quality of service so
 

1761
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,350
quality of service so
you don't see big spikes way up and then

1762
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
you don't see big spikes way up and then
 

1763
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,149
you don't see big spikes way up and then
way down and and going you know

1764
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,159
way down and and going you know
 

1765
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,750
way down and and going you know
where you're at the max performance of

1766
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:19,760
where you're at the max performance of
 

1767
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,990
where you're at the max performance of
the bus down to zero back to the middle

1768
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
the bus down to zero back to the middle
 

1769
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,230
the bus down to zero back to the middle
and are you when you say when you say

1770
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
and are you when you say when you say
 

1771
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,750
and are you when you say when you say
over provisioning are you talking about

1772
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:25,760
over provisioning are you talking about
 

1773
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,430
over provisioning are you talking about
i o

1774
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440
i o
 

1775
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,630
i o
now over provisioning is where if i have

1776
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
now over provisioning is where if i have
 

1777
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,070
now over provisioning is where if i have
like if you see uh an ssd that has

1778
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
like if you see uh an ssd that has
 

1779
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,990
like if you see uh an ssd that has
say it has 940 or 960 gigs yeah

1780
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,000
say it has 940 or 960 gigs yeah
 

1781
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,190
say it has 940 or 960 gigs yeah
uh of 960 gig capacities really common

1782
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200
uh of 960 gig capacities really common
 

1783
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,070
uh of 960 gig capacities really common
right yeah

1784
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
right yeah
 

1785
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,149
right yeah
that that's a terabyte of nand that's on

1786
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
that that's a terabyte of nand that's on
 

1787
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,510
that that's a terabyte of nand that's on
there and it has

1788
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,520
there and it has
 

1789
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,990
there and it has
over provisioning of uh three to five

1790
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
over provisioning of uh three to five
 

1791
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,029
over provisioning of uh three to five
percent

1792
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
percent
 

1793
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,750
percent
for the data itself so the storage yeah

1794
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
for the data itself so the storage yeah
 

1795
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,789
for the data itself so the storage yeah
okay and so when

1796
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
okay and so when
 

1797
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,470
okay and so when
when you see a drive that says one

1798
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
when you see a drive that says one
 

1799
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,990
when you see a drive that says one
terabyte

1800
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
terabyte
 

1801
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,230
terabyte
uh lots of times that's still the same

1802
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
uh lots of times that's still the same
 

1803
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,830
uh lots of times that's still the same
amount of nand as if you bought a

1804
00:30:59,830 --> 00:30:59,840
amount of nand as if you bought a
 

1805
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,350
amount of nand as if you bought a
a 960 but the thing you'll notice is

1806
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
a 960 but the thing you'll notice is
 

1807
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,269
a 960 but the thing you'll notice is
like on a consumer drive if you get up

1808
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
like on a consumer drive if you get up
 

1809
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,789
like on a consumer drive if you get up
to being

1810
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
to being
 

1811
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,509
to being
90 full on one that's not over

1812
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:09,519
90 full on one that's not over
 

1813
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,549
90 full on one that's not over
provisioned

1814
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
provisioned
 

1815
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,149
provisioned
you'll start you'll see the performance

1816
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
you'll start you'll see the performance
 

1817
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,590
you'll start you'll see the performance
also start to tank

1818
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
also start to tank
 

1819
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,269
also start to tank
whereas if you have one that if you have

1820
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:15,279
whereas if you have one that if you have
 

1821
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,310
whereas if you have one that if you have
the you know the 960 gig drive it can be

1822
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,320
the you know the 960 gig drive it can be
 

1823
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,590
the you know the 960 gig drive it can be
90 percent full

1824
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:19,600
90 percent full
 

1825
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,269
90 percent full
and you'll still be riding at the same

1826
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
and you'll still be riding at the same
 

1827
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,149
and you'll still be riding at the same
speed as when it was empty

1828
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,159
speed as when it was empty
 

1829
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,430
speed as when it was empty
uh you know you it well

1830
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
uh you know you it well
 

1831
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,269
uh you know you it well
i won't say when it was empty because

1832
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
i won't say when it was empty because
 

1833
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,190
i won't say when it was empty because
one of the things we do that uh

1834
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
one of the things we do that uh
 

1835
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,909
one of the things we do that uh
preconditioning right that's part of our

1836
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
preconditioning right that's part of our
 

1837
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,430
preconditioning right that's part of our
uh script that we

1838
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
uh script that we
 

1839
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,389
uh script that we
we we're working on there um that

1840
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
we we're working on there um that
 

1841
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,590
we we're working on there um that
preconditioning

1842
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
preconditioning
 

1843
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,909
preconditioning
basically make sure that the drives sort

1844
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
basically make sure that the drives sort
 

1845
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,509
basically make sure that the drives sort
of dirtied up and

1846
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:43,519
of dirtied up and
 

1847
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,549
of dirtied up and
and uh is doing real workload type stuff

1848
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:46,559
and uh is doing real workload type stuff
 

1849
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,269
and uh is doing real workload type stuff
so you guys

1850
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
so you guys
 

1851
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,950
so you guys
because you can test anything out of the

1852
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
because you can test anything out of the
 

1853
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,350
because you can test anything out of the
box and it might look spectacular but

1854
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
box and it might look spectacular but
 

1855
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,430
box and it might look spectacular but
then when you put it into real use

1856
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
then when you put it into real use
 

1857
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,909
then when you put it into real use
uh throw it into a data center and you

1858
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
uh throw it into a data center and you
 

1859
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,909
uh throw it into a data center and you
know week into being used

1860
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
know week into being used
 

1861
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,509
know week into being used
you're like this is not performing the

1862
00:31:59,509 --> 00:31:59,519
you're like this is not performing the
 

1863
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,110
you're like this is not performing the
way it did you know

1864
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
way it did you know
 

1865
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,710
way it did you know
i threw these consumer drives in there

1866
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
i threw these consumer drives in there
 

1867
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,389
i threw these consumer drives in there
and they were great now they uh are

1868
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
and they were great now they uh are
 

1869
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,190
and they were great now they uh are
terrible

1870
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
terrible
 

1871
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,430
terrible
yeah um oh i see that like yeah i've

1872
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
yeah um oh i see that like yeah i've
 

1873
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,029
yeah um oh i see that like yeah i've
seen that on desktop drives and

1874
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
seen that on desktop drives and
 

1875
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,190
seen that on desktop drives and
and things like that yeah when they get

1876
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,200
and things like that yeah when they get
 

1877
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,830
and things like that yeah when they get
warmed up and dirty and make sense

1878
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:13,840
warmed up and dirty and make sense
 

1879
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,590
warmed up and dirty and make sense
they're under real world working

1880
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
they're under real world working
 

1881
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,950
they're under real world working
conditions and not just

1882
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
conditions and not just
 

1883
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,470
conditions and not just
running a benchmark and now my iops

1884
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
running a benchmark and now my iops
 

1885
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,549
running a benchmark and now my iops
on the and you mentioned iops maybe i

1886
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:22,559
on the and you mentioned iops maybe i
 

1887
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,669
on the and you mentioned iops maybe i
could get you to briefly

1888
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
could get you to briefly
 

1889
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,549
could get you to briefly
explain what that means to us um but it

1890
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
explain what that means to us um but it
 

1891
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,190
explain what that means to us um but it
is

1892
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
is
 

1893
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,669
is
through the roof higher uh on the ssds

1894
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
through the roof higher uh on the ssds
 

1895
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,870
through the roof higher uh on the ssds
what does that what does that tell us so

1896
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:34,880
what does that what does that tell us so
 

1897
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,990
what does that what does that tell us so
uh part of that is it's because of the

1898
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,000
uh part of that is it's because of the
 

1899
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,389
uh part of that is it's because of the
it's physics right so on the ssd

1900
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:42,399
it's physics right so on the ssd
 

1901
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,549
it's physics right so on the ssd
it's it's science we're talking about

1902
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
it's it's science we're talking about
 

1903
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,830
it's it's science we're talking about
physics because

1904
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:45,840
physics because
 

1905
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,870
physics because
the uh hard drive is actually relying

1906
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
the uh hard drive is actually relying
 

1907
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,509
the uh hard drive is actually relying
uh for the iops it actually has that

1908
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
uh for the iops it actually has that
 

1909
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,070
uh for the iops it actually has that
that

1910
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
that
 

1911
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,470
that
needle that moves back and forth with

1912
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,480
needle that moves back and forth with
 

1913
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,070
needle that moves back and forth with
the reader physical drives yeah

1914
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
the reader physical drives yeah
 

1915
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,110
the reader physical drives yeah
the the spinning drives and so it

1916
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,120
the the spinning drives and so it
 

1917
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,070
the the spinning drives and so it
actually has to in order to read a point

1918
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
actually has to in order to read a point
 

1919
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,870
actually has to in order to read a point
it has to physically move to somewhere

1920
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
it has to physically move to somewhere
 

1921
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,909
it has to physically move to somewhere
find that

1922
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
find that
 

1923
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,950
find that
read it uh verify it and then move to

1924
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:08,960
read it uh verify it and then move to
 

1925
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,389
read it uh verify it and then move to
the next point find it read it and

1926
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
the next point find it read it and
 

1927
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,750
the next point find it read it and
verify it so

1928
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
verify it so
 

1929
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,029
verify it so
uh just because of the way

1930
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
uh just because of the way
 

1931
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,269
uh just because of the way
physics and thermodynamics work the

1932
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:17,279
physics and thermodynamics work the
 

1933
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,470
physics and thermodynamics work the
drive can't spin

1934
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:18,480
drive can't spin
 

1935
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,630
drive can't spin
any faster they you know hard drives are

1936
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
any faster they you know hard drives are
 

1937
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,470
any faster they you know hard drives are
really really great for what they do

1938
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
really really great for what they do
 

1939
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,990
really really great for what they do
and they you can get really big hard

1940
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
and they you can get really big hard
 

1941
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,669
and they you can get really big hard
drives and

1942
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
drives and
 

1943
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,350
drives and
they're pretty durable uh but

1944
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
they're pretty durable uh but
 

1945
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,269
they're pretty durable uh but
physics can't take them any farther

1946
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:31,279
physics can't take them any farther
 

1947
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,389
physics can't take them any farther
because and

1948
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
because and
 

1949
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,310
because and
so when you go over to an ssd

1950
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
so when you go over to an ssd
 

1951
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,549
so when you go over to an ssd
uh you're just everything's uh

1952
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
uh you're just everything's uh
 

1953
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,430
uh you're just everything's uh
done through solid state you're not

1954
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,440
done through solid state you're not
 

1955
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,630
done through solid state you're not
moving anything

1956
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
moving anything
 

1957
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,070
moving anything
except electrons and so uh

1958
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,080
except electrons and so uh
 

1959
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,070
except electrons and so uh
you know you're you you have like your

1960
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
you know you're you you have like your
 

1961
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,990
you know you're you you have like your
seek times go down by a thousand

1962
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,000
seek times go down by a thousand
 

1963
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,029
seek times go down by a thousand
fold uh and that's why you'll see what

1964
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
fold uh and that's why you'll see what
 

1965
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,070
fold uh and that's why you'll see what
the iops difference the

1966
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,080
the iops difference the
 

1967
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,789
the iops difference the
random read which was your best on the

1968
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
random read which was your best on the
 

1969
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,950
random read which was your best on the
hard drives random read of

1970
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:03,960
hard drives random read of
 

1971
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,149
hard drives random read of
673 iops

1972
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
673 iops
 

1973
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,349
673 iops
whereas the random read on the raid of

1974
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:09,359
whereas the random read on the raid of
 

1975
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,430
whereas the random read on the raid of
dc 500r was 121 000 iops

1976
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:13,440
dc 500r was 121 000 iops
 

1977
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,589
dc 500r was 121 000 iops
so 180 times the speed

1978
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:17,599
so 180 times the speed
 

1979
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,909
so 180 times the speed
yeah it's it's just a little faster a

1980
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
yeah it's it's just a little faster a
 

1981
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,069
yeah it's it's just a little faster a
little bit

1982
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079
little bit
 

1983
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,470
little bit
that's amazing so now we understand now

1984
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
that's amazing so now we understand now
 

1985
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,109
that's amazing so now we understand now
that

1986
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:25,119
that
 

1987
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,869
that
so i've jumped from uh going from the

1988
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
so i've jumped from uh going from the
 

1989
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,510
so i've jumped from uh going from the
spinning drives to the ssds now my

1990
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
spinning drives to the ssds now my
 

1991
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,750
spinning drives to the ssds now my
bottleneck is sata

1992
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
bottleneck is sata
 

1993
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,790
bottleneck is sata
the the connection so uh

1994
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
the the connection so uh
 

1995
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,550
the the connection so uh
that uh 121 000 iops

1996
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
that uh 121 000 iops
 

1997
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,790
that uh 121 000 iops
uh uh with that if you went to

1998
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
uh uh with that if you went to
 

1999
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,990
uh uh with that if you went to
now you go to pcie based drives

2000
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
now you go to pcie based drives
 

2001
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,190
now you go to pcie based drives
pcie gen 3 nvme type drives

2002
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,200
pcie gen 3 nvme type drives
 

2003
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,510
pcie gen 3 nvme type drives
so either m.2 or u.2

2004
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,520
so either m.2 or u.2
 

2005
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,950
so either m.2 or u.2
um u.2 is more friendly to

2006
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
um u.2 is more friendly to
 

2007
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,870
um u.2 is more friendly to
a data center because it is in that two

2008
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:00,880
a data center because it is in that two
 

2009
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,109
a data center because it is in that two
and a half inch form factor rather than

2010
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:03,119
and a half inch form factor rather than
 

2011
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,270
and a half inch form factor rather than
the gum stick form factor which is a

2012
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,280
the gum stick form factor which is a
 

2013
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,870
the gum stick form factor which is a
little difficult to manage there's a few

2014
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
little difficult to manage there's a few
 

2015
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,150
little difficult to manage there's a few
people that have

2016
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,160
people that have
 

2017
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,310
people that have
uh adapters and things like that to put

2018
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
uh adapters and things like that to put
 

2019
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,870
uh adapters and things like that to put
lots of m.2s into servers but

2020
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
lots of m.2s into servers but
 

2021
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,670
lots of m.2s into servers but
um you know i think the the u.2 and the

2022
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
um you know i think the the u.2 and the
 

2023
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,829
um you know i think the the u.2 and the
ruler are going to be much more common

2024
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
ruler are going to be much more common
 

2025
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,310
ruler are going to be much more common
uh going forward for putting in lots of

2026
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
uh going forward for putting in lots of
 

2027
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,829
uh going forward for putting in lots of
you know like 24

2028
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
you know like 24
 

2029
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,349
you know like 24
or more u.2 drives uh

2030
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
or more u.2 drives uh
 

2031
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,550
or more u.2 drives uh
like nvme ssds into a server

2032
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
like nvme ssds into a server
 

2033
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,950
like nvme ssds into a server
uh but now you're talking like the iops

2034
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
uh but now you're talking like the iops
 

2035
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,069
uh but now you're talking like the iops
go up another

2036
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:32,079
go up another
 

2037
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,670
go up another
factor right um so like an nvme drive

2038
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
factor right um so like an nvme drive
 

2039
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,870
factor right um so like an nvme drive
because it's not limited

2040
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
because it's not limited
 

2041
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,710
because it's not limited
to uh by the sata bus uh

2042
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
to uh by the sata bus uh
 

2043
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,710
to uh by the sata bus uh
it is limited by the pcie bus so

2044
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:44,720
it is limited by the pcie bus so
 

2045
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,990
it is limited by the pcie bus so
um you know you go to gen 4 and that's

2046
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000
um you know you go to gen 4 and that's
 

2047
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,069
um you know you go to gen 4 and that's
twice as fast as gen 3 so

2048
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
twice as fast as gen 3 so
 

2049
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,870
twice as fast as gen 3 so
you know potentially twice as fast i

2050
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
you know potentially twice as fast i
 

2051
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,030
you know potentially twice as fast i
haven't seen any models where

2052
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
haven't seen any models where
 

2053
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,310
haven't seen any models where
like it is twice as fast but you know

2054
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:58,320
like it is twice as fast but you know
 

2055
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,270
like it is twice as fast but you know
significantly

2056
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
significantly
 

2057
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,430
significantly
gen 4 demos that i've seen are

2058
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
gen 4 demos that i've seen are
 

2059
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,190
gen 4 demos that i've seen are
significantly faster like uh

2060
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
significantly faster like uh
 

2061
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,670
significantly faster like uh
you know you're talking off of by 16

2062
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
you know you're talking off of by 16
 

2063
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,589
you know you're talking off of by 16
i think the fastest demo i've seen so

2064
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:11,599
i think the fastest demo i've seen so
 

2065
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,710
i think the fastest demo i've seen so
far is about

2066
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
far is about
 

2067
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,910
far is about
25 gigabytes per second off of one

2068
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:15,920
25 gigabytes per second off of one
 

2069
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,790
25 gigabytes per second off of one
device

2070
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
device
 

2071
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,829
device
on one gen 4 bytes

2072
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:19,839
on one gen 4 bytes
 

2073
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,870
on one gen 4 bytes
per second wow and and i don't know how

2074
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:22,880

scalable that is

2076
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
scalable that is
 

2077
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,109
scalable that is
currently but that was when gen 4 was

good but uh
 

2087
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,069
good but uh
i'll call it kind of experimental until

2088
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
i'll call it kind of experimental until
 

2089
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,630
i'll call it kind of experimental until
intel and amd both have their gen 4 out

2115
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,750
drives connected to it and they're doing
some really neat demos and as is amd

their gpus um but
 

2121
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,109
their gpus um but
all that right now seems it it's like

2122
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
all that right now seems it it's like
 

2123

all that right now seems it it's like
if i have to go drop uh five to

2127
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,790

gotta wait until it's uh

2128
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
gotta wait until it's uh

somebody else uh works out all the

00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
somebody else uh works out all the
 

2131
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,510
somebody else uh works out all the

wrinkles in that experiment
 

2133
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,990
wrinkles in that experiment
so thinking about my use case so i

2134
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
so thinking about my use case so i
 

2135
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,829
so thinking about my use case so i
obviously work here in a studio so i'm

2136
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:31,839
obviously work here in a studio so i'm
 

2137
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,430
obviously work here in a studio so i'm
doing a lot of video production

doing a lot of video production
uh maybe some of our viewers are working

2140
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:35,359
uh maybe some of our viewers are working
 

2141
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,870
uh maybe some of our viewers are working
in an office environment where they've

2142
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:36,880
in an office environment where they've
 

2143
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,550
in an office environment where they've
got similar scenarios where

2144
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
got similar scenarios where
 

2145
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,069
got similar scenarios where
hey we've got to replace the drives in

2146
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
hey we've got to replace the drives in
 

2147
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,910
hey we've got to replace the drives in
an older server or maybe it's not even

2148
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
an older server or maybe it's not even
 

2149
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,230
an older server or maybe it's not even
that old but

2150
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,240
that old but
 

2151
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,510
that old but
they're they're not necessarily

2152
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
they're they're not necessarily
 

2153
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,950
they're they're not necessarily
replacing an entire server they just

2154
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:46,960
replacing an entire server they just
 

2155
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,510
replacing an entire server they just
want to put

2156
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
want to put
 

2157
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,310
want to put
ssds in instead of the spinning drives

2158
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,320
ssds in instead of the spinning drives
 

2159
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,109
ssds in instead of the spinning drives
because they're

2160
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
because they're
 

2161
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,790
because they're
kind of the way to go right now and

2162
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:52,800
kind of the way to go right now and
 

2163
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,550
kind of the way to go right now and
we're certainly seeing a big performance

2164
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:54,560
we're certainly seeing a big performance
 

2165
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,510
we're certainly seeing a big performance
boost here

2166
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
boost here
 

2167
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,630
boost here
um is there you know where

2168
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:58,640
um is there you know where
 

2169
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,550
um is there you know where
where is the performance gain so for me

2170
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:00,560
where is the performance gain so for me
 

2171
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,670
where is the performance gain so for me
it's it's in

2172
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
it's it's in
 

2173
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,310
it's it's in
editing real time 4k video it's it's

2174
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
editing real time 4k video it's it's
 

2175
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,990
editing real time 4k video it's it's

people in those communities and and you
 

2199
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,670
people in those communities and and you
know like uh

know like uh
 

2201
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,390

uh doctors and lawyers are notoriously
 

2203
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,550
uh doctors and lawyers are notoriously
cheap when it comes to you know like uh

00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,560
cheap when it comes to you know like uh
 

2205
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,630
cheap when it comes to you know like uh
spending money on on systems like that

2206
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:40,640
spending money on on systems like that
 

2207
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,390
spending money on on systems like that
but the systems also

2208
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
but the systems also
 

2209
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,750
but the systems also
drive all of the uh all of the uh

2210
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:45,760
drive all of the uh all of the uh
 

2211
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,270
drive all of the uh all of the uh
revenue in their business so it's really

2212
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,280
revenue in their business so it's really
 

2213
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,510
revenue in their business so it's really
important for them to keep them updated

2214
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,520
important for them to keep them updated
 

2215
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,270
important for them to keep them updated
and uh i think the thing that you get by

2216
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280
and uh i think the thing that you get by
 

2217
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,390
and uh i think the thing that you get by
going from hard drive to ssds

2218
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
going from hard drive to ssds

on an upgrade of an older system you

2220
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,240
on an upgrade of an older system you
 

2221
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,990
on an upgrade of an older system you
know is you'll be able to ring

2222
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
know is you'll be able to ring
 

2223
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,870
know is you'll be able to ring
at least two or three more years out of

00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:02,880
at least two or three more years out of

um you know you'll you you'll you always
 

2229
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,310
um you know you'll you you'll you always
hit a bottleneck somewhere but

2230
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
hit a bottleneck somewhere but
 

2231
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,589
hit a bottleneck somewhere but
rather than your system being the

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,440
bottleneck it might be the os or the
 

2235
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,710
bottleneck it might be the os or the
version of the software

2236
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720
version of the software
 

2237
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,790
version of the software
that you're using or something like that

2238
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
that you're using or something like that
 

2239
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,829
that you're using or something like that
but uh

2240
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
but uh
 

2241
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,589
but uh
you you'll make something much more

2242
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
you you'll make something much more
 

2243
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,230
you you'll make something much more
usable have you ever taken an old hard

2244
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,240
usable have you ever taken an old hard
 

2245
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,030
usable have you ever taken an old hard
drive ss

2246
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,040
drive ss
 

2247
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,589
drive ss
or a whole old hard drive laptop and put

2248
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
or a whole old hard drive laptop and put
 

2249
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,950
or a whole old hard drive laptop and put
an ssd in it and

2250
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:24,960
an ssd in it and
 

2251
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,550
an ssd in it and
you know it's like all sudden it's like

2252
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,560
you know it's like all sudden it's like
 

2253
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,069
you know it's like all sudden it's like
why was i gonna get rid of this thing

2254
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
why was i gonna get rid of this thing
 

2255
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,950
why was i gonna get rid of this thing
it's so fast

2256
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:28,960
it's so fast
 

2257
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,790
it's so fast
exactly it like breathes new life into

2258
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:30,800
exactly it like breathes new life into
 

2259
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,790
exactly it like breathes new life into
an old system and that's exactly what

2260
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:32,800
an old system and that's exactly what
 

2261
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,670
an old system and that's exactly what
this has done

2262
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
this has done
 

2263
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,430
this has done
for our server and i and as you're

2264
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:35,440
for our server and i and as you're
 

2265
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,710
for our server and i and as you're
talking about bottlenecks i'm thinking

2266
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
talking about bottlenecks i'm thinking
 

2267
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,190
talking about bottlenecks i'm thinking
okay well sata is six gig a second

2268
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
okay well sata is six gig a second
 

2269
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,030
okay well sata is six gig a second
so i think my bottleneck actually mark

2270
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,040
so i think my bottleneck actually mark
 

2271
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,630
so i think my bottleneck actually mark
is going to be my networking because i'm

2272
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:42,640
is going to be my networking because i'm
 

2273
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,750
is going to be my networking because i'm
only on gig

2274
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
only on gig
 

2275
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,430
only on gig
ethernet so that's my bottleneck but

2276
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
ethernet so that's my bottleneck but
 

2277
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,390
ethernet so that's my bottleneck but
being a very small business myself

2278
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,400
being a very small business myself
 

2279
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,670
being a very small business myself
having gig

2280
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,680
having gig
 

2281
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,390
having gig
ethernet and being able to edit video

2282
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
ethernet and being able to edit video
 

2283
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,950
ethernet and being able to edit video
over

2284
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
over
 

2285
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,510
over
one gig a second is is stellar it's

2286
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520
one gig a second is is stellar it's
 

2287
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,630
one gig a second is is stellar it's
superb

2288
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:58,640
superb
 

2289
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,349
superb
um well the the trick you know for that

2290
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:01,359
um well the the trick you know for that
 

2291
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,510
um well the the trick you know for that
like because my job was breaking those

2292
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,520
like because my job was breaking those
 

2293
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,870
like because my job was breaking those
kind of bottlenecks uh

2294
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:04,880
kind of bottlenecks uh
 

2295
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,910
kind of bottlenecks uh
previously is i would put a 10 gig

2296
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
previously is i would put a 10 gig
 

2297
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,030
previously is i would put a 10 gig
uh on your server and have a switch that

2298
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,040
uh on your server and have a switch that
 

2299
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,550
uh on your server and have a switch that
distributes it out to

2300
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
distributes it out to
 

2301
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,750
distributes it out to
your gigabit clients and and until you

2302
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:15,760
your gigabit clients and and until you
 

2303
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,109
your gigabit clients and and until you
uh get a 10 gig uh or desktop or

2304
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
uh get a 10 gig uh or desktop or
 

2305
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,069
uh get a 10 gig uh or desktop or
something but

2306
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
something but
 

2307
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,309
something but
you could always go you know like uh do

2308
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:22,319
you could always go you know like uh do
 

2309
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,309
you could always go you know like uh do
it gradually just like adding

2310
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
it gradually just like adding
 

2311
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,870
it gradually just like adding
uh ssds to your uh uh legacy systems

2312
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:28,880
uh ssds to your uh uh legacy systems
 

2313
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,109
uh ssds to your uh uh legacy systems
yeah uh that's a good idea just to kind

2314
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,119
yeah uh that's a good idea just to kind
 

2315
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,630
yeah uh that's a good idea just to kind
of upgrade the the networking

2316
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,640
of upgrade the the networking
 

2317
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,990
of upgrade the the networking
as i go that's the next step what kind

2318
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,000
as i go that's the next step what kind
 

2319
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,309
as i go that's the next step what kind
of longevity am i going to be looking at

2320
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:38,319
of longevity am i going to be looking at
 

2321
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,950
of longevity am i going to be looking at
for ssds i know like when ssds first

2322
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:40,960
for ssds i know like when ssds first
 

2323
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,430
for ssds i know like when ssds first
came out so years ago

2324
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,440
came out so years ago
 

2325
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,309
came out so years ago
there were those of us who were hesitant

2326
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:46,319
there were those of us who were hesitant
 

2327
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,550
there were those of us who were hesitant
and afraid to switch to ssd

2328
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:48,560
and afraid to switch to ssd
 

2329
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,470
and afraid to switch to ssd
because the they weren't quite as

2330
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
because the they weren't quite as
 

2331
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,190
because the they weren't quite as
reliable but that has completely changed

2332
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
reliable but that has completely changed
 

2333
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,430
reliable but that has completely changed
over the past several years are we

2334
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
over the past several years are we
 

2335
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,430
over the past several years are we
seeing like what kind of lifespan do we

2336
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:57,440
seeing like what kind of lifespan do we
 

2337
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,630
seeing like what kind of lifespan do we
expect from

2338
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:58,640
expect from
 

2339
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,910
expect from
like your your data center drives uh

2340
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:01,920
like your your data center drives uh
 

2341
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,990
like your your data center drives uh
so our data center drives we warrant

2342
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000
so our data center drives we warrant
 

2343
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,550
so our data center drives we warrant
them for five years uh

2344
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
them for five years uh
 

2345
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,790
them for five years uh
and then you know like the they have

2346
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
and then you know like the they have
 

2347
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,550
and then you know like the they have
different um

2348
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
different um
 

2349
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,230
different um
drive rights per day warranties as well

2350
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
drive rights per day warranties as well
 

2351
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,790
drive rights per day warranties as well
so

2352
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:14,800
so
 

2353
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,390
so
like the dc 500 that's a 0.3 drive right

2354
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:18,400
like the dc 500 that's a 0.3 drive right
 

2355
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,589
like the dc 500 that's a 0.3 drive right
per day so

2356
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
per day so
 

2357
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,309
per day so
if you have a four terabyte or a three

2358
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
if you have a four terabyte or a three
 

2359
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,270
if you have a four terabyte or a three
three point

2360
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
three point
 

2361
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,109
three point
uh was it three point eight six uh

2362
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
uh was it three point eight six uh
 

2363
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,710
uh was it three point eight six uh
if you have a four essentially there's

2364
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:28,720
if you have a four essentially there's
 

2365
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,230
if you have a four essentially there's
four terabytes in the end on there

2366
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
four terabytes in the end on there
 

2367
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,069
four terabytes in the end on there
but if you have like a four terabyte

2368
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
but if you have like a four terabyte
 

2369
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,990
but if you have like a four terabyte
drive or an eight terabyte drive

2370
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,000
drive or an eight terabyte drive
 

2371
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,790
drive or an eight terabyte drive
of the r which is a read centric model

2372
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:36,800
of the r which is a read centric model
 

2373
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,069
of the r which is a read centric model
you can get

2374
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
you can get
 

2375
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,069
you can get
up to you can do uh 0.3 drivewrites per

2376
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:42,079
up to you can do uh 0.3 drivewrites per
 

2377
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,950
up to you can do uh 0.3 drivewrites per
day

2378
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960

 

2379
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,190

the m version of that is 1.5 drive

2380
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
the m version of that is 1.5 drive
 

2381
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,390
the m version of that is 1.5 drive
rights per day

rights per day
 

2383
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,230
rights per day
and if you think about that for a four

2384
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
and if you think about that for a four
 

2385
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,510
and if you think about that for a four
terabyte drive

2386
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
terabyte drive
 

2387
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,670
terabyte drive
that's a lot of writing yeah if you're

2388
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
that's a lot of writing yeah if you're
 

2389
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,870
that's a lot of writing yeah if you're
riding uh

2390
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
riding uh
 

2391
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,309
riding uh
you know like six terabytes a day uh

2392
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:00,319
you know like six terabytes a day uh
 

2393
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,230
you know like six terabytes a day uh
you might be running facebook off of

2394
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
you might be running facebook off of
 

2395
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,470
you might be running facebook off of
your uh server i don't know

2396
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
your uh server i don't know
 

2397
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,030
your uh server i don't know
that's a lot of data to fill up and

2398
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,040
that's a lot of data to fill up and
 

2399
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,750
that's a lot of data to fill up and
delete

2400
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:07,760
delete
 

2401
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,750
delete
because that's it's not so much about um

2402
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
because that's it's not so much about um
 

2403
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,109
because that's it's not so much about um
you know like if you're just collecting

2404
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:13,119
you know like if you're just collecting
 

2405
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,190
you know like if you're just collecting
drives or collecting data on your drives

2406
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
drives or collecting data on your drives
 

2407
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,990
drives or collecting data on your drives
that's what the r

2408
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
that's what the r
 

2409
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,630
that's what the r
is all about right so the read centric

2410
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:18,640
is all about right so the read centric
 

2411
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,109
is all about right so the read centric
one

2412
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
one
 

2413
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,349
one
if i want to like have a database full

2414
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
if i want to like have a database full
 

2415
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,230
if i want to like have a database full
of video

2416
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
of video
 

2417
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,190
of video
and images and text files and

spreadsheets and
 

2421
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,349
spreadsheets and
stuff that's going to live there forever

2422
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359
stuff that's going to live there forever
 

2423
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,230
stuff that's going to live there forever
the

2424
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
the
 

2425
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,710
the
dc 500r is a really great drive because

2426
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
dc 500r is a really great drive because
 

2427
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,390
dc 500r is a really great drive because
i'm just adding stuff to it all the time

2428
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,400
i'm just adding stuff to it all the time
 

2429
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,030
i'm just adding stuff to it all the time
i'm not

2430
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
i'm not
 

2431
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,950
i'm not
adding you know like a terabyte at a

2432
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
adding you know like a terabyte at a
 

2433
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,270
adding you know like a terabyte at a
time and then calculating that data and

2434
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
time and then calculating that data and
 

2435
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,270
time and then calculating that data and
deleting the whole thing and and putting

2436
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280
deleting the whole thing and and putting
 

2437
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,230
deleting the whole thing and and putting
in the answer that's another terabyte um

2438
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,240
in the answer that's another terabyte um
 

2439
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,550
in the answer that's another terabyte um
you know that that's something like uh

2440
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
you know that that's something like uh
 

2441
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,230
you know that that's something like uh
uh lamp where you've got

2442
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,240
uh lamp where you've got
 

2443
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,349
uh lamp where you've got
you know apache server and and or an

2444
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
you know apache server and and or an
 

2445
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,870
you know apache server and and or an
oltp server or you know some kind of

2446
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
oltp server or you know some kind of
 

2447
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,470
oltp server or you know some kind of
online transaction thing where

2448
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:56,480
online transaction thing where
 

2449
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,510
online transaction thing where
you know uh you're you're just grinding

2450
00:42:59,510 --> 00:42:59,520
you know uh you're you're just grinding
 

2451
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,109
you know uh you're you're just grinding
through the data like you know

2452
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
through the data like you know
 

2453
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,190
through the data like you know
facebook where you're just adding new

2454
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
facebook where you're just adding new
 

2455
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,550
facebook where you're just adding new
cat videos all the time and then

2456
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,560
cat videos all the time and then
 

2457
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,150
cat videos all the time and then
deleting them as they get old

2458
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160
deleting them as they get old
 

2459
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,589
deleting them as they get old
right um you know uh most people don't

2460
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:09,599
right um you know uh most people don't
 

2461
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,589
right um you know uh most people don't
do that like i i've got a

2462
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
do that like i i've got a
 

2463
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,030
do that like i i've got a
drobo uh server that i just add stuff to

2464
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,040
drobo uh server that i just add stuff to
 

2465
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,550
drobo uh server that i just add stuff to
constantly so

2466
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
constantly so
 

2467
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,430
constantly so
uh i actually had to unplug it because

2468
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:19,440
uh i actually had to unplug it because
 

2469
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,030
uh i actually had to unplug it because
it's so loud because of all the hard

2470
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
it's so loud because of all the hard
 

2471
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,670
it's so loud because of all the hard
drives

2472
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680
drives
 

2473
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,630
drives
i'm gonna put uh four four terabyte ssds

2474
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:24,640
i'm gonna put uh four four terabyte ssds
 

2475
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,309
i'm gonna put uh four four terabyte ssds
in there perfect that'll make it quiet

2476
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:26,319
in there perfect that'll make it quiet
 

2477
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,510
in there perfect that'll make it quiet
yeah yeah

2478
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:27,520
yeah yeah
 

2479
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,190
yeah yeah
it's pretty quiet all of a sudden it's

2480
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,200
it's pretty quiet all of a sudden it's
 

2481
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,550
it's pretty quiet all of a sudden it's
interesting you say that like

2482
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:30,560
interesting you say that like
 

2483
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,910
interesting you say that like
because that's the other thing that we

2484
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
because that's the other thing that we
 

2485
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,349
because that's the other thing that we
don't necessarily think about with the

2486
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
don't necessarily think about with the
 

2487
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,390
don't necessarily think about with the
upgrade is this

2488
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
upgrade is this
 

2489
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,109
upgrade is this
the silence of them the energy

2490
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
the silence of them the energy
 

2491
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:37,990
the silence of them the energy
efficiency yeah

2492
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
efficiency yeah
 

2493
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,349
efficiency yeah
i i have to say that ssds

2494
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:41,359
i i have to say that ssds
 

2495
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,470
i i have to say that ssds
uh compared to hard drive

2496
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:44,480
uh compared to hard drive
 

2497
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,550
uh compared to hard drive
energy efficiency hard drives are

2498
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,560
energy efficiency hard drives are
 

2499
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,230
energy efficiency hard drives are
actually really good at when they're not

2500
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
actually really good at when they're not
 

2501
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,870
actually really good at when they're not
being used

2502
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
being used
 

2503
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,990
being used
shutting down like they've they've

2504
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,000
shutting down like they've they've
 

2505
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,430
shutting down like they've they've
really gotten good at being energy

2506
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:53,440
really gotten good at being energy
 

2507
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,109
really gotten good at being energy
efficient and

2508
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
efficient and
 

2509
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,030
efficient and
and i don't think that anybody's

2510
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,040
and i don't think that anybody's
 

2511
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,230
and i don't think that anybody's
replacing

2512
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,240
replacing
 

2513
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,430
replacing
hard drives with like

2514
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:01,440
hard drives with like
 

2515
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,270
hard drives with like
well they have that's exactly what we

2516
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
well they have that's exactly what we
 

2517
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,349
well they have that's exactly what we
are exactly replacing hard drives

2518
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:05,359
are exactly replacing hard drives
 

2519
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,510
are exactly replacing hard drives
but they have their places like if i

2520
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
but they have their places like if i
 

2521
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,710
but they have their places like if i
want to store

2522
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
want to store
 

2523
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,710
want to store
40 terabytes of data that's just cold

2524
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:12,720
40 terabytes of data that's just cold
 

2525
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,790
40 terabytes of data that's just cold
data that i'm not going to access all

2526
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:14,800
data that i'm not going to access all
 

2527
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,309
data that i'm not going to access all
the time but i really i need for legal

2528
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:16,319
the time but i really i need for legal
 

2529
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,270
the time but i really i need for legal
reasons or

2530
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
reasons or
 

2531
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,430
reasons or
you know like to make me feel secure or

2532
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
you know like to make me feel secure or
 

2533
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,190
you know like to make me feel secure or
it's my backup

2534
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,200
it's my backup
 

2535
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,270
it's my backup
that's a perfect use for hard drives if

2536
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
that's a perfect use for hard drives if
 

2537
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,470
that's a perfect use for hard drives if
you have data that you want to be able

2538
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
you have data that you want to be able
 

2539
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,309
you have data that you want to be able
to read and work off of

2540
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:26,319
to read and work off of
 

2541
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,910
to read and work off of
hard drives are terrible for that just

2542
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:27,920
hard drives are terrible for that just
 

2543
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,430
hard drives are terrible for that just
because of the latency and you know it's

2544
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:29,440
because of the latency and you know it's
 

2545
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,750
because of the latency and you know it's
like

2546
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
like
 

2547
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,790
like
if you're one user and you

2548
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
if you're one user and you
 

2549
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,630
if you're one user and you
are getting the data off the hard drives

2550
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,640
are getting the data off the hard drives
 

2551
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,990
are getting the data off the hard drives
it's bad enough to have to wait for it

2552
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
it's bad enough to have to wait for it
 

2553
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,750
it's bad enough to have to wait for it
but if you've got like 10 users

2561
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,630
uh hard drive array at the same time
you can start you know like hey you know

you can start you know like hey you know
 

2563
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,790
you can start you know like hey you know
like why why is everything slowing down

2564
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,800
like why why is everything slowing down
 

2565
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,309
like why why is everything slowing down
so much and it's like

2566
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
so much and it's like
 

2567
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,990
so much and it's like
um you know you'll also see a lot better

2568
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
um you know you'll also see a lot better
 

2569

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,829
difference in the well if
you think about the the uh vm language

2600
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
you think about the the uh vm language
 

2601
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:28,150
you think about the the uh vm language
of

2602
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,160
of
 

2603
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,270
of
spin up uh uh virtual machine yeah

2604
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
spin up uh uh virtual machine yeah
 

2605
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,550
spin up uh uh virtual machine yeah
uh when you are coming off of uh uh

2606
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
uh when you are coming off of uh uh
 

2607
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,470
uh when you are coming off of uh uh
sata drive there's still a little spin

2608
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
sata drive there's still a little spin
 

2609
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,829
sata drive there's still a little spin
up time but it it's

2610
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:37,839
up time but it it's
 

2611
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,790
up time but it it's
like a fraction of uh what the spin up

2612
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:40,800
like a fraction of uh what the spin up
 

2613
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,190
like a fraction of uh what the spin up
time

2614
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,200
time
 

2615
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,950
time
because it really is a spin up time off

2616
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
because it really is a spin up time off
 

2617
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,550
because it really is a spin up time off
of hard drives

2618
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:44,560
of hard drives
 

2619
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,630
of hard drives
and then if you go to nvme it's it's

2620
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:46,640
and then if you go to nvme it's it's
 

2621
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,710
and then if you go to nvme it's it's
almost like it was in dram you know it's

2622
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:48,720
almost like it was in dram you know it's
 

2623
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,470
almost like it was in dram you know it's
like because the nvme drives

2624
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:50,480
like because the nvme drives
 

2625
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,990
like because the nvme drives
being the you know it's off the sata bus

2626
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
being the you know it's off the sata bus
 

2627
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,109
being the you know it's off the sata bus
and on to the pcie bus it's one step

2628
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:57,119
and on to the pcie bus it's one step
 

2629
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,390
and on to the pcie bus it's one step
closer to the processor

2630
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
closer to the processor
 

2631
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,309
closer to the processor
that's why like dram is the best because

2632
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319
that's why like dram is the best because
 

2633
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,470
that's why like dram is the best because
it's on the processor right sure

2634
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
it's on the processor right sure
 

2635
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,030
it's on the processor right sure
even the you know i guess the cache and

2636
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,040
even the you know i guess the cache and
 

2637
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,150
even the you know i guess the cache and
the processor

2638
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
the processor
 

2639
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,630
the processor
is on the processor but it's also not

2640
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,640
is on the processor but it's also not
 

2641
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,230
is on the processor but it's also not
connected to your uh

2642
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
connected to your uh
 

2643
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,270
connected to your uh
display and and all that so

2644
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
display and and all that so
 

2645
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,589
display and and all that so
dram is sort of the king and which we

2646
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:17,599
dram is sort of the king and which we
 

2647
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,470
dram is sort of the king and which we
also make there

2648
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,480
also make there
 

2649
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,750
also make there
there's all these um kind of irrelevant

2650
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:21,760
there's all these um kind of irrelevant
 

2651
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,270
there's all these um kind of irrelevant
almost benchmarks of

2652
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:23,280
almost benchmarks of
 

2653
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,630
almost benchmarks of
people turning on their computer and how

2654
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:24,640
people turning on their computer and how
 

2655
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,630
people turning on their computer and how
long does it take to boot and it's

2656
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640
long does it take to boot and it's
 

2657
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,349
long does it take to boot and it's
and it's it's kind of irrelevant in so

2658
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
and it's it's kind of irrelevant in so
 

2659
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,790
and it's it's kind of irrelevant in so
many ways and it makes me think about

2660
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
many ways and it makes me think about
 

2661
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,589
many ways and it makes me think about
those spinning

2662
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:31,599
those spinning
 

2663
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,990

i click on something how quickly
 

2671
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,230

does it happen how quickly does that

2672
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:42,240
does it happen how quickly does that
 

2673
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,589
does it happen how quickly does that
application come up

2674
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
application come up
 

2675
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,829
application come up
and for me in this scenario how quickly

2676
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
and for me in this scenario how quickly
 

2677
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,349
and for me in this scenario how quickly
am i able to open

am i able to open
 

2679
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,630
am i able to open
large video files in my editor and right

00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,640
large video files in my editor and right
 

2681
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,030
large video files in my editor and right
that's like where yeah i'm not having to

2682
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
that's like where yeah i'm not having to
 

2683
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,910
that's like where yeah i'm not having to
wait for

2684
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:53,920
wait for
 

2685
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,309
wait for
for that that moment is just an instant

2686
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
for that that moment is just an instant
 

2687
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,910
for that that moment is just an instant
moment for me

2688
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:57,920
moment for me
 

2689
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,109
moment for me
i would do uh so i a lot of the i would

2690
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
i would do uh so i a lot of the i would
 

2691
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,030
i would do uh so i a lot of the i would
create demos for when we go to trade

2692
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,040
create demos for when we go to trade
 

2693
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,030
create demos for when we go to trade
shows like nib the broadcasters

2694
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
shows like nib the broadcasters
 

2695
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,190
shows like nib the broadcasters
uh north american broadcaster show or

ibc
 

2699
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,270
ibc
in amsterdam uh i'd create some demos

2700
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
in amsterdam uh i'd create some demos
 

2701
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,550
in amsterdam uh i'd create some demos
with adobe

2702
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:12,560
with adobe
 

2703
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,349
with adobe
and uh you know one of the things that

2704
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
and uh you know one of the things that
 

2705
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,109
and uh you know one of the things that
we'd have to do there is like if we're

2706
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
we'd have to do there is like if we're
 

2707
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,710
we'd have to do there is like if we're
editing 8k or you know 4k or 8k video

2708
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:20,720
editing 8k or you know 4k or 8k video
 

2709
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,390
editing 8k or you know 4k or 8k video

how easy is it to walk away from that
 

3469
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,109
how easy is it to walk away from that
and switch to a new system like

3470
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
and switch to a new system like
 

3471
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,069
and switch to a new system like
i think like for anybody who's using it

3472
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:48,079
i think like for anybody who's using it

they have to build a whole new system

3476
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:51,760
they have to build a whole new system
 

3477
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,950
they have to build a whole new system
essentially

3478
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
essentially
 

3479
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,670
essentially
like that's what simple here's the

3480
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:55,680
like that's what simple here's the
 

3481
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,069
like that's what simple here's the
choice

3482
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:56,079
choice
 

3483
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,349
choice
the choice becomes do we now

3484
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
the choice becomes do we now
 

3485
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,630
the choice becomes do we now
transition to centos stream

3486
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,640
transition to centos stream
 

3487
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,510
transition to centos stream
which is a rolling release which is what

3488
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,520
which is a rolling release which is what
 

3489
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,349
which is a rolling release which is what
sent os

3490
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
sent os
 

3491
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,910
sent os
that was the appeal of centos is that it

3492
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:09,920
that was the appeal of centos is that it
 

3493
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,030
that was the appeal of centos is that it
was not

3494
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,040
was not
 

3495
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,829
was not
a rolling release yeah so now do we go

3496
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:13,839
a rolling release yeah so now do we go
 

3497
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,109
a rolling release yeah so now do we go
to

3498
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
to
 

3499
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,750
to
centos stream and become a rolling

3500
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
centos stream and become a rolling
 

3501
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,109
centos stream and become a rolling
release or

3502
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:19,119
release or
 

3503
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,109
release or
do we start looking at debian which is

3504
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,119
do we start looking at debian which is
 

3505
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,750
do we start looking at debian which is
going to fall under that category ubuntu

3506
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:25,760
going to fall under that category ubuntu
 

3507
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,349
going to fall under that category ubuntu
is very well supported by

3508
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
is very well supported by
 

3509
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:31,349
is very well supported by
canonical um so it opens up

3510
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:31,359

where this takes things because i do

01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
where this takes things because i do

01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,430
where this takes things because i do
think

3732
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
think
 

3733
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,430
think
arm could really become the new standard

3734
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
arm could really become the new standard
 

3735
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,230
arm could really become the new standard
it's fast and it's cheap yeah and not

3736
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,240
it's fast and it's cheap yeah and not
 

3737
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,670
it's fast and it's cheap yeah and not
only that but to think

3738
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:13,680
only that but to think
 

3739
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,230
only that but to think
of all of the single board computers out

3740
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:16,240
of all of the single board computers out
 

3741
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,150
of all of the single board computers out
there that are arm based

3742
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
there that are arm based
 

3743
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,549
there that are arm based
i mean maybe there's still a hesitation

3744
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:20,559
i mean maybe there's still a hesitation
 

3745
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:21,190
i mean maybe there's still a hesitation
to put

3746
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
to put
 

3747
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,390
to put
um at least to rely and depend on

3748
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
um at least to rely and depend on
 

3749
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,789
um at least to rely and depend on
single board computing in the in the

3750
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:26,799
single board computing in the in the
 

3751
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:27,670
single board computing in the in the
data center

3752
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:27,680
data center
 

3753
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,349
data center
right and that there is some truth in

3754
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
right and that there is some truth in
 

3755
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,510
right and that there is some truth in
that and and part of that comes from the

3756
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:31,520
that and and part of that comes from the
 

3757
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,190
that and and part of that comes from the
reliability of storage so you think

3758
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,200
reliability of storage so you think
 

3759
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,270
reliability of storage so you think
about a raspberry pi with an sd card

3760
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:35,280
about a raspberry pi with an sd card
 

3761
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,789
about a raspberry pi with an sd card
well do you really want your entire

3762
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
well do you really want your entire
 

3763
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,870
well do you really want your entire
infrastructure housed on an sd card

3764
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
infrastructure housed on an sd card
 

3765
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,589
infrastructure housed on an sd card
probably not

3766
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
probably not
 

3767
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,029
probably not
no but arm is a lot more than just

3768
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
no but arm is a lot more than just
 

3769
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,549
no but arm is a lot more than just
single board computers and it's not

3770
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:44,559
single board computers and it's not
 

3771
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,870
single board computers and it's not
limited to sd cards you look at

3772
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
limited to sd cards you look at
 

3773
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,430
limited to sd cards you look at
things from you know boards from odroid

3774
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:49,440
things from you know boards from odroid
 

3775
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,510
things from you know boards from odroid
you look at boards from pine 64 and

3776
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:51,520
you look at boards from pine 64 and
 

3777
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,430
you look at boards from pine 64 and
other competitors to raspberry pi

3778
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
other competitors to raspberry pi
 

3779
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,589
other competitors to raspberry pi
and they all support emmc yeah and in

3780
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:55,599
and they all support emmc yeah and in
 

3781
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:56,950
and they all support emmc yeah and in
fact a lot of them

3782
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:56,960
fact a lot of them
 

3783
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,549
fact a lot of them
from both of those manufacturers and a

3784
01:05:58,549 --> 01:05:58,559
from both of those manufacturers and a
 

3785
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,829
from both of those manufacturers and a
lot of other manufacturers are

3786
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
lot of other manufacturers are
 

3787
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:00,549
lot of other manufacturers are
supporting

01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:00,559
supporting
 

3789
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,589

um m.2 yes so you can stick an nvme

3790
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:03,599
um m.2 yes so you can stick an nvme

01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:07,359
on your single board computer yeah and
 

3795
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,270
on your single board computer yeah and
now you're running like something that

3796
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:09,280
now you're running like something that
 

3797
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,430
now you're running like something that
is screaming fast

3798
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:11,440
is screaming fast
 

3799
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,789

super super fast super reliable and uh

3800
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
super super fast super reliable and uh
 

3801
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,549
super super fast super reliable and uh
that belongs in the data center if you

3802
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
that belongs in the data center if you
 

3803
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,390
that belongs in the data center if you
ask me i completely agree

3804
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
ask me i completely agree
 

3805
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,510
ask me i completely agree
and i mean right now you know in

3806
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:21,520
and i mean right now you know in
 

3807
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,789
and i mean right now you know in
my day job we're dealing with servers

3808
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
my day job we're dealing with servers
 

3809
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:25,670
my day job we're dealing with servers
and

3810
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
and
 

3811
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,829
and
you know all this kind of stuff and one

3812
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
you know all this kind of stuff and one
 

3813
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,870
you know all this kind of stuff and one
of the things we've been talking about

3814
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
of the things we've been talking about
 

3815
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,150
of the things we've been talking about
lately is getting

3816
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,160
lately is getting
 

3817
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,349
lately is getting
our own server and so what you know with

3818
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:33,359
our own server and so what you know with
 

3819
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,710
our own server and so what you know with
this story makes me think

3820
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:34,720
this story makes me think
 

3821
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,789
this story makes me think
are we at the point where we could run

3822
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:38,799
are we at the point where we could run
 

3823
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:42,230
are we at the point where we could run
uh you know take like a hosting server

3824
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,240
uh you know take like a hosting server
 

3825
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:42,710
uh you know take like a hosting server
or

3826
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:42,720
or
 

3827
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,589
or
you know you know a cloud server and run

3828
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
you know you know a cloud server and run
 

3829
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,109
you know you know a cloud server and run
it off

3830

you know a rock pro 64 or something sure
why not where you've got it hooked up

3834
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:51,280
why not where you've got it hooked up
 

3835
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,549
why not where you've got it hooked up
to you know a whole bunch of terabyte

3836
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:54,559

but that you're not even usb like i

3842
01:06:59,829 --> 01:06:59,839
but that you're not even usb like i
 

3843
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,990
but that you're not even usb like i
think well and it has usb3

3844
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:02,000
think well and it has usb3
 

3845
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,109
think well and it has usb3
but think about um iscsi yeah

3846
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:05,119
but think about um iscsi yeah
 

3847
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,910
but think about um iscsi yeah
yeah sure right good example um but the

3848
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:07,920
yeah sure right good example um but the
 

3849
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,029
yeah sure right good example um but the
data center isn't

01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359

the kyc
data so know your customers so your

3994
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520

3997
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,030

and so on to the other exchange

3998
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
and so on to the other exchange
 

3999
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,030
and so on to the other exchange
that looks like it's a law that will

4000
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:49,040
that looks like it's a law that will
 

4001
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,430
that looks like it's a law that will
come on an international basis

4002
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,440
come on an international basis
 

4003
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,269
come on an international basis
and that also means that if you want to

4004
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:53,279
and that also means that if you want to
 

4005
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,430
and that also means that if you want to
transfer those coins out of the exchange

4006
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
transfer those coins out of the exchange
 

4007
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,430
transfer those coins out of the exchange
onto your private wallet

4008
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
onto your private wallet
 

4009
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,990
onto your private wallet
this exchange has to do kyc on your

4010
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:00,000
this exchange has to do kyc on your
 

4011
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,110
this exchange has to do kyc on your
private wallet

4012
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:01,120
private wallet
 

4013
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,790
private wallet
so you have to prove that that private

4014
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
so you have to prove that that private
 

4015
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,630
so you have to prove that that private
wallet is really yours

4016
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:04,640
wallet is really yours
 

4017
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,470
wallet is really yours
how are they going to do that don't know

4018
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:06,480
how are they going to do that don't know
 

4019
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,470
how are they going to do that don't know
yet but it looks like that's going to

4020
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:08,480
yet but it looks like that's going to
 

4021
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,070
yet but it looks like that's going to
happen it's a law

4022
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
happen it's a law
 

4023
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,310
happen it's a law
that might happen in the u.s and if it's

4024
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
that might happen in the u.s and if it's
 

4025
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,990
that might happen in the u.s and if it's
happening here in the u.s it will happen

4026
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:14,000
happening here in the u.s it will happen
 

4027
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,870
happening here in the u.s it will happen
everywhere

4028
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
everywhere
 

4029
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,950
everywhere
so my recommendation at this stage is

4030
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
so my recommendation at this stage is
 

4031
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,550
so my recommendation at this stage is
take your coins and get them

4032
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
take your coins and get them
 

4033
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,790
take your coins and get them

not accurately but you can't predict

4106
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:36,880
not accurately but you can't predict
 

4107
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,630
not accurately but you can't predict
which trend the the share is um

which trend the the share is um
 

4109

and also a little bit in regards to
 

4111
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,470
and also a little bit in regards to
cryptos because

4112

4117
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,590
our area
um they're coming from the traditional

4118
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:49,600
um they're coming from the traditional
 

4119
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,430

and therefore they will also apply them

4124
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,080
and therefore they will also apply them
 

4125

and therefore they will also apply them
here so if they apply them here

4126

here so if they apply them here
 

4127
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,430
here so if they apply them here
that means that uh they will be somehow

that means that uh they will be somehow
 

4129
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,310
that means that uh they will be somehow
applicable to what we're doing too

out with mom or dad
 

4655
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,070
out with mom or dad
and uh you know that's that's a hard

4656
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,080
and uh you know that's that's a hard
 

4657

thing to accomplish
 

4659
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,990
thing to accomplish
when you are like only a phone call away

4660
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:36,000
when you are like only a phone call away
 

4661
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,270
when you are like only a phone call away
that's right and it's almost like you

4662
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,280
that's right and it's almost like you
 

4663
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:37,510
that's right and it's almost like you
know

4664
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:37,520
know
 

4665
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,950
know
your phone is in your pocket now and

4666
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:38,960
your phone is in your pocket now and
 

4667
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,189
your phone is in your pocket now and
you're you're stuck with it ringing if

4668
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
you're you're stuck with it ringing if
 

4669
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:41,669
you're you're stuck with it ringing if
uh

4670
01:20:41,669 --> 01:20:41,679
uh
 

4671
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,070
uh
so it's like have a separate phone yeah

4672
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
so it's like have a separate phone yeah
 

4673

01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,390
it's still only a prototype but
scientists believe that the future

4794
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,400
scientists believe that the future
 

4795
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,629
scientists believe that the future
possibilities are very promising

4796
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:48,639
possibilities are very promising
 

4797
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,430
possibilities are very promising
i think this is so neat that we now have

4798
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
i think this is so neat that we now have
 

4799
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:51,990
i think this is so neat that we now have
now granted

4800
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
now granted
 

4801
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,990
now granted
it's a small version but you have

4802
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:54,000
it's a small version but you have
 

4803
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,830
it's a small version but you have
itty-bitty you're what is this an

4804
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:55,840
itty-bitty you're what is this an
 

4805
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,189
itty-bitty you're what is this an
airplane for amps

4806
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199
airplane for amps
 

4807
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,750
airplane for amps
exactly but you have this propulsion

4808
01:22:59,750 --> 01:22:59,760
exactly but you have this propulsion
 

4809
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,470
exactly but you have this propulsion
system

4810
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:00,480
system
 

4811
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,870
system
that doesn't require fuel that has its

4812
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
that doesn't require fuel that has its
 

4813
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,870
that doesn't require fuel that has its
own ability to

4814
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:04,880
own ability to
 

4815
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,910
own ability to
convert within the air and keep going i

4816
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:07,920
convert within the air and keep going i
 

4817
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,790
convert within the air and keep going i
mean

4818
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
mean
 

4819
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,870
mean
in theory if you could hook this sucker

4820
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:10,880
in theory if you could hook this sucker
 

4821
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,310
in theory if you could hook this sucker
up to say

4822
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:12,320
up to say
 

4823
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,990
up to say
solar panels you could have non-stop

4824
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,000
solar panels you could have non-stop
 

4825
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,030
solar panels you could have non-stop
flight non-stop theoretically

4826
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,040
flight non-stop theoretically
 

4827
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,070
flight non-stop theoretically
unreal like that's wild becca makes some

4828
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,080
unreal like that's wild becca makes some
 

4829
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,590
unreal like that's wild becca makes some
really interesting points about

4830
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:23,600
really interesting points about
 

4831
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,990
really interesting points about
like quadcopter flight and yeah i love

4832
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:26,000
like quadcopter flight and yeah i love
 

4833
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,510
like quadcopter flight and yeah i love
flying my quadcopters but

4834
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:27,520
flying my quadcopters but
 

4835
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,390
flying my quadcopters but
she's right the battery is like in some

4836
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:30,400
she's right the battery is like in some
 

4837
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,629
she's right the battery is like in some
of them it's like 15 minutes flight time

4838
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:32,639
of them it's like 15 minutes flight time
 

4839
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:34,470
of them it's like 15 minutes flight time
and so you buy extra batteries so that

4840
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
and so you buy extra batteries so that
 

4841
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,669
and so you buy extra batteries so that
you can swap them in the field and you

4842
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:35,679
you can swap them in the field and you
 

4843
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,669
you can swap them in the field and you
get you know 45 minutes flight time but

4844
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
get you know 45 minutes flight time but
 

4845
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,270
get you know 45 minutes flight time but
you're still dealing with the fact that

4846
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
you're still dealing with the fact that
 

4847
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,350
you're still dealing with the fact that
the battery doesn't last very long

4848
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:41,360
the battery doesn't last very long
 

4849
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,110
the battery doesn't last very long
if you ever shoot any video in the air

4850
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:43,120
if you ever shoot any video in the air
 

4851
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,550
if you ever shoot any video in the air
it's the same kind of thing like you get

4852
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:44,560
it's the same kind of thing like you get
 

4853
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,910
it's the same kind of thing like you get
up there you take some video and then

4854
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:45,920
up there you take some video and then
 

4855
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,950
up there you take some video and then
you got to land and take it

4856
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:46,960
you got to land and take it
 

4857
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,030
you got to land and take it
change the battery yep well here's an

4858
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,040
change the battery yep well here's an
 

4859
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,350
change the battery yep well here's an
opportunity something that can actually

4860
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
opportunity something that can actually
 

4861
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,229
opportunity something that can actually
uh power itself essentially yeah but

4862
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
uh power itself essentially yeah but
 

4863
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,950
uh power itself essentially yeah but
will it ever see

4864
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
will it ever see
 

4865
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,590
will it ever see
passenger flight that's the thing like

4866
01:23:59,590 --> 01:23:59,600
passenger flight that's the thing like
 

4867
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,149
passenger flight that's the thing like
so

4868
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
so
 

4869
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,070
so
it's more like it's gonna be tough yeah

4870
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,080
it's more like it's gonna be tough yeah
 

4871
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,830
it's more like it's gonna be tough yeah
it's gonna be more i think

4872
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:03,840
it's gonna be more i think
 

4873
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,149
it's gonna be more i think
um you know smaller payload payloads and

4874
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
um you know smaller payload payloads and
 

4875
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:06,950
um you know smaller payload payloads and
this is where

4876
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:06,960
this is where
 

4877
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,990
this is where
you know i think in terms of a camera or

4878
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:10,000
you know i think in terms of a camera or
 

4879
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,990
you know i think in terms of a camera or
you know being able to to shoot video

4880
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000
you know being able to to shoot video
 

4881
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,590
you know being able to to shoot video
but they're they're flying like an

4882
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:13,600
but they're they're flying like an
 

4883
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,470
but they're they're flying like an
airplane so

4884
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
airplane so
 

4885
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,990
airplane so
yeah it's going to be moving pretty

4886
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
yeah it's going to be moving pretty
 

4887
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,910
yeah it's going to be moving pretty
quickly so what about

4888
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
quickly so what about
 

4889
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,070
quickly so what about
now we've had um henry bailey brown on

4890
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,080
now we've had um henry bailey brown on
 

4891
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,510
now we've had um henry bailey brown on
the show to talk about

4892
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,520
the show to talk about
 

4893
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,629
the show to talk about
how he uses his quadcopters to shoot um

4894
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:24,639
how he uses his quadcopters to shoot um
 

4895
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,310
how he uses his quadcopters to shoot um
3d um uh imagery

4896
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:28,320
3d um uh imagery
 

4897
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,229
3d um uh imagery
so that he can then convert that into

4898
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:30,239
so that he can then convert that into
 

4899
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,350
so that he can then convert that into
unreal engine

4900
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:31,360
unreal engine
 

4901
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,790
unreal engine
and even 3d print buildings and things

4902
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
and even 3d print buildings and things
 

4903
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,590
and even 3d print buildings and things
like that

4904
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:35,600
like that
 

4905
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,470
like that
but looking at topography and using a

4906
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480
but looking at topography and using a
 

4907
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,990
but looking at topography and using a
technology like this to keep

4908
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:40,000
technology like this to keep
 

4909
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,270
technology like this to keep
constant tabs on changing landscapes

4910
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:43,280
constant tabs on changing landscapes
 

4911
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,470
constant tabs on changing landscapes
or on like the we think about like bing

4912
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:46,480
or on like the we think about like bing
 

4913
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,229
or on like the we think about like bing
maps or google earth and

4914
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
maps or google earth and
 

4915
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,390
maps or google earth and
the way that they're able to recreate

4916
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400
the way that they're able to recreate
 

4917
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,590
the way that they're able to recreate
our planet

4918
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
our planet
 

4919
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,390
our planet
in basically what to us seems like real

4920
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,400
in basically what to us seems like real
 

4921
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,310
in basically what to us seems like real
time like sci-fi

4922
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,320
time like sci-fi
 

4923
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,750
time like sci-fi
but being able to have something in the

4924
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,760
but being able to have something in the
 

4925
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,750
but being able to have something in the
air that can just fly around the globe

4926
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,760
air that can just fly around the globe
 

4927
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,790
air that can just fly around the globe
all the time taking this imagery and

4928
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:02,800
all the time taking this imagery and
 

4929
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,110
all the time taking this imagery and
shooting it back to their servers and

4930
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:05,120
shooting it back to their servers and
 

4931
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,149
shooting it back to their servers and
making it like

4932
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:06,159
making it like
 

4933
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,470
making it like
virtually you know much more real-time

4934
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:08,480
virtually you know much more real-time
 

4935
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,750
virtually you know much more real-time
than the satellite imagery that they

4936
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:09,760
than the satellite imagery that they
 

4937
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,270
than the satellite imagery that they
have now that's four years old

4938
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:11,280
have now that's four years old
 

4939
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,270
have now that's four years old
yeah right yeah could those be things

4940
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:13,280
yeah right yeah could those be things
 

4941
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,629
yeah right yeah could those be things
but you know what

4942
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:14,639
but you know what
 

4943
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:16,390
but you know what
what kind of things spring to mind for

4944
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
what kind of things spring to mind for
 

4945
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,229
what kind of things spring to mind for
you and of course you know in the back

4946
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:18,239
you and of course you know in the back
 

4947
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,590
you and of course you know in the back
of my mind there is that

4948
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,600
of my mind there is that
 

4949
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,910
of my mind there is that
nagging i fear that the military would

4950
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
nagging i fear that the military would
 

4951
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,669
nagging i fear that the military would
get a hold of this kind of technology

4952
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:25,679
get a hold of this kind of technology
 

4953
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,750
get a hold of this kind of technology
guarantee they're already using it i

4954
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
guarantee they're already using it i
 

4955
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,110
guarantee they're already using it i
know and so this is probably from a

4956
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:29,120
know and so this is probably from a
 

4957
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,310
know and so this is probably from a
military contract

4958
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:30,320
military contract
 

4959
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,229
military contract
yeah this is probably going through your

4960
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:32,239
yeah this is probably going through your
 

4961
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:33,510
yeah this is probably going through your
head and and

4962
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:33,520
head and and
 

4963
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,470
head and and
so there that is very ominous and it's

4964
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,480
so there that is very ominous and it's
 

4965
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,070
so there that is very ominous and it's
because this is a really really cool

4966
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:38,080
because this is a really really cool
 

4967
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,750
because this is a really really cool
technology but like so many cool

4968
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:39,760
technology but like so many cool
 

4969
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,870
technology but like so many cool
technologies

4970
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
technologies
 

4971
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,229
technologies
it could be used for good and it could

4972
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
it could be used for good and it could
 

4973
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,189
it could be used for good and it could
be used for we'll we'll say evil

4974
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:45,199
be used for we'll we'll say evil
 

4975
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,669
be used for we'll we'll say evil
but you know what could we do with this

4976
01:25:47,669 --> 01:25:47,679
but you know what could we do with this
 

4977
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:48,870
but you know what could we do with this
that is good

4978
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
that is good
 

4979
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,390
that is good
that's what i'd love to know and that's

4980
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,400
that's what i'd love to know and that's
 

4981
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,070
that's what i'd love to know and that's
where my head went

4982
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:52,080
where my head went
 

4983
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,470
where my head went
like the what actually caught my

4984
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
like the what actually caught my
 

4985
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,310
like the what actually caught my
attention the most in this story was the

4986
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:56,320
attention the most in this story was the
 

4987
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,470
attention the most in this story was the
fact that it was indoor flight

4988
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,480
fact that it was indoor flight
 

4989
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,990
fact that it was indoor flight
like initially i was like oh they're

4990
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:00,000
like initially i was like oh they're
 

4991
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,830
like initially i was like oh they're
flying it outside but when they're like

4992
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:01,840
flying it outside but when they're like
 

4993
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,510
flying it outside but when they're like
oh our tests indoors i'm going hold on

4994
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520
oh our tests indoors i'm going hold on
 

4995
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,430
oh our tests indoors i'm going hold on
this is indoors okay

4996
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,440
this is indoors okay
 

4997
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,189
this is indoors okay
so could you theoretically take this

4998
01:26:09,189 --> 01:26:09,199
so could you theoretically take this
 

4999
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,110
so could you theoretically take this
shrink it down i mean who knows what the

5000
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
shrink it down i mean who knows what the
 

5001
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,189
shrink it down i mean who knows what the
components are are you entering a fly

5002
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
components are are you entering a fly
 

5003
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,390
components are are you entering a fly
no no not that small but like how neat

5004
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
no no not that small but like how neat
 

5005
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,830
no no not that small but like how neat
would it be if they could take this

5006
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
would it be if they could take this
 

5007
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,590
would it be if they could take this
propulsion system to the point where

5008
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:19,600
propulsion system to the point where
 

5009
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,470
propulsion system to the point where
it's

5010
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:20,480
it's
 

5011
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,629
it's
um you know for lack of a better word

5012
01:26:22,629 --> 01:26:22,639
um you know for lack of a better word
 

5013
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,910
um you know for lack of a better word
levitation

5014
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:23,920
levitation
 

5015
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,390
levitation
where you can have a stabilizer it has

5016
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:26,400
where you can have a stabilizer it has
 

5017
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,990
where you can have a stabilizer it has
to be moving though

5018
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:28,000
to be moving though
 

5019
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,950
to be moving though
well it has to right now but if you

5020
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:30,960
well it has to right now but if you
 

5021
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,470
well it has to right now but if you
because it's taking the ions from the

5022
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,480
because it's taking the ions from the
 

5023
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,590
because it's taking the ions from the
air and converting them for that

5024
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
air and converting them for that
 

5025
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,870
air and converting them for that
propulsion system

5026

propulsion system
 

5027
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,390
propulsion system
so i don't know what you know the

5028
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
so i don't know what you know the
 

5029
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,070
so i don't know what you know the
airflow is out behind or anything like

5030
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,080
airflow is out behind or anything like
 

5031
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,870
airflow is out behind or anything like
that but

5032
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:38,880
that but
 

5033
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,910
that but
could it you know i'm i'm thinking could

5034
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:41,920
could it you know i'm i'm thinking could
 

5035
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,590
could it you know i'm i'm thinking could
it be converted to things in your home

5036
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:43,600
it be converted to things in your home
 

5037
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,790
it be converted to things in your home
where it's like

5038
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
where it's like
 

5039
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,310
where it's like
you don't have to worry about ladders

5040
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
you don't have to worry about ladders
 

5041
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,550
you don't have to worry about ladders
anymore because you can have

5042
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
anymore because you can have
 

5043
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,390
anymore because you can have
you know scaffolding or something some

5044
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:50,400
you know scaffolding or something some
 

5045
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,149
you know scaffolding or something some
sort of painting unit that goes up for

5046
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
sort of painting unit that goes up for
 

5047
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:52,629
sort of painting unit that goes up for
you

you
but i'm just thinking the internal home

5050
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
but i'm just thinking the internal home
 

5051
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:55,750
but i'm just thinking the internal home
use i'm like this could

5052

use i'm like this could
 

5053
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,870
use i'm like this could
change the way we build homes so that

homes and get rid of ladders this thing

5062
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,480
homes and get rid of ladders this thing
 

5063
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,030
homes and get rid of ladders this thing
is like

5064
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:07,040
is like
 

5065
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,430
is like
five meters wide and it can only tech

5066
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440
five meters wide and it can only tech
 

5067
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,110
five meters wide and it can only tech
and you could just convert it that

5068
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,120
and you could just convert it that
 

5069
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,110
and you could just convert it that
could be any living space jeff anybody
