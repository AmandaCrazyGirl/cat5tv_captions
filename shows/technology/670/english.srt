there's got to be a way where sasha can

730
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
there's got to be a way where sasha can
 

731
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,550
there's got to be a way where sasha can
do this remotely

732
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
do this remotely
 

733
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,269
do this remotely
i have a 3d printer now yes you do and

734
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
i have a 3d printer now yes you do and
 

735
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,150
i have a 3d printer now yes you do and
you're using it

736
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
you're using it
 

737
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,710
you're using it
so well yes so what are you doing with

738
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
so well yes so what are you doing with
 

739
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,150
so well yes so what are you doing with
that so that sasha can shoot me from

740
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
that so that sasha can shoot me from
 

741
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,829
that so that sasha can shoot me from
across the country well we talked about

742
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
across the country well we talked about
 

743
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,310
across the country well we talked about
this

744
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
this
 

745
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,150
this
and the decision was made internally

746
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
and the decision was made internally
 

747
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,990
and the decision was made internally
that we cannot do that

748
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
that we cannot do that
 

749
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,629
that we cannot do that
yes and and that's an unfortunate thing

750
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
yes and and that's an unfortunate thing
 

751
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,829
yes and and that's an unfortunate thing
so that

752
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
so that
 

753
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,710
so that
we're still going to shoot him but we're

754
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
we're still going to shoot him but we're
 

755
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,829
we're still going to shoot him but we're
figuring it out

756
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
figuring it out
 

757
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,150
figuring it out
and here is the solution first of all

758
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
and here is the solution first of all
 

759
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,990
and here is the solution first of all
the reason we cannot do it

760
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
the reason we cannot do it
 

761
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,790
the reason we cannot do it
is because everything that we do is to

762
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
is because everything that we do is to
 

763
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,310
is because everything that we do is to
be open sourced

764
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
be open sourced
 

765
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,990
be open sourced
so when we create this circuit for the

766
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
so when we create this circuit for the
 

767
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,269
so when we create this circuit for the
the uh the false labor that's going to

768
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
the uh the false labor that's going to
 

769
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,790
the uh the false labor that's going to
be available on our github and people

770
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
be available on our github and people
 

771
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,910
be available on our github and people
are going to be able to

772
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
are going to be able to
 

773
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,509
are going to be able to
access that and see how it works and

774
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
access that and see how it works and
 

775
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,430
access that and see how it works and
that's cool

776
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
that's cool
 

777
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,470
that's cool
we do not want to be um

778
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
we do not want to be um
 

779
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,230
we do not want to be um
a part of distributing a system

780
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
a part of distributing a system
 

781
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,430
a part of distributing a system
a system that can connect to a weapon

782
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
a system that can connect to a weapon
 

783
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,150
a system that can connect to a weapon
that can be controlled remotely that's

784
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
that can be controlled remotely that's
 

785
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,629
that can be controlled remotely that's
fair

786
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
fair
 

787
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,590
fair
right so because we don't want to give

788
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
right so because we don't want to give

i i wanted to take category 5
to the next level in that when we do an

854
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
to the next level in that when we do an
 

855
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,069
to the next level in that when we do an
unboxing

856
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
unboxing
 

857
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,590
unboxing
i wanted to get out of the old style of

858
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
i wanted to get out of the old style of
 

859
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,110
i wanted to get out of the old style of
unboxing where we

860
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
unboxing where we
 

861
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,590
unboxing where we
open a box take it out of the box

862
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
open a box take it out of the box
 

863
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,629
open a box take it out of the box
connect it

864
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
connect it
 

865
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,710
connect it
maybe fire it up if we have time right

866
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
maybe fire it up if we have time right
 

867
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,150
maybe fire it up if we have time right
but with a one hour show you don't have

868
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160
but with a one hour show you don't have
 

869
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,269
but with a one hour show you don't have
a lot of time for that kind of stuff

870
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
a lot of time for that kind of stuff
 

871
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,069
a lot of time for that kind of stuff
that's true

872
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
that's true
 

873
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,670
that's true
so one of the things that we introduced

874
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
so one of the things that we introduced
 

875
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,350
so one of the things that we introduced
this year is

876
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
this year is
 

877
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,509
this year is
production week and production week is a

878
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
production week and production week is a
 

879
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,189
production week and production week is a
time when we take

880
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
time when we take
 

881
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,230
time when we take
the week off of the live broadcast so

882
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
the week off of the live broadcast so
 

883
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,590
the week off of the live broadcast so
that we can instead

884
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
that we can instead
 

885
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,590
that we can instead
work behind the scenes on doing some of

886
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
work behind the scenes on doing some of
 

887
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,829
work behind the scenes on doing some of
those extra videos so

888
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
those extra videos so
 

889
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,910
those extra videos so
that is like filming and unboxing that

890
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
that is like filming and unboxing that
 

891
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,189
that is like filming and unboxing that
we can then

892
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
we can then
 

893
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,870
we can then
speed up in post so that it only takes

894
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
speed up in post so that it only takes
 

895
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,310
speed up in post so that it only takes
three minutes five minutes out of the

896
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
three minutes five minutes out of the
 

897
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,150
three minutes five minutes out of the
video and then we can actually

898
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
video and then we can actually
 

899
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,470
video and then we can actually
demonstrate the hardware right so you

900
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
demonstrate the hardware right so you
 

901
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,150
demonstrate the hardware right so you
know that's a really really neat way for

902
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
know that's a really really neat way for
 

903
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,069
know that's a really really neat way for
us to be able to do a better show for

904
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
us to be able to do a better show for
 

905
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,350
us to be able to do a better show for
you

906
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
you
 

907
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,870
you
and it changes kind of the paradigm of

908
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
and it changes kind of the paradigm of
 

909
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,710
and it changes kind of the paradigm of
how we shoot things and and that has

910
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
how we shoot things and and that has
 

911
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,430
how we shoot things and and that has
uh has worked fairly well that's

912
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
uh has worked fairly well that's
 

913
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,590
uh has worked fairly well that's
something that we're still evolving and

914
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
something that we're still evolving and
 

915
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,910
something that we're still evolving and
come january you're going to see that

916
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
come january you're going to see that
 

917
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,069
come january you're going to see that
our schedule is changing again

918
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
our schedule is changing again
 

919
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,310
our schedule is changing again
production week is going to actually be

920
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
production week is going to actually be
 

921
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,670
production week is going to actually be
every two weeks

922
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
every two weeks
 

923
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,430
every two weeks
so that is uh going to be something that

924
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
so that is uh going to be something that
 

925
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,590
so that is uh going to be something that
we're experimenting with and maybe

926
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
we're experimenting with and maybe
 

927
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,030
we're experimenting with and maybe
if it works great then that's what we're

928
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
if it works great then that's what we're
 

929
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,470
if it works great then that's what we're
going to do if it doesn't then we're

930
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
going to do if it doesn't then we're
 

931
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,990
going to do if it doesn't then we're
going to adjust things and

932
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
going to adjust things and
 

933
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,310
going to adjust things and
we're still figuring out what it looks

934
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
we're still figuring out what it looks
 

935
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,590
we're still figuring out what it looks

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,230
and and by doing that we're trying to
figure out

1288
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
figure out
 

1289
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,950
figure out
you know it's tough because robert's a

1290
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
you know it's tough because robert's a
 

1291
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,390
you know it's tough because robert's a

right but then all of a sudden we're
 

1295
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,630
right but then all of a sudden we're
doing a review of a raspberry pi

1296
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
doing a review of a raspberry pi
 

1297
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,470
doing a review of a raspberry pi
so i think from a viewer's perspective

1298
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
so i think from a viewer's perspective
 

1299

so get on there and don't just pay
attention to the the raspberry pi stuff

1318
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
attention to the the raspberry pi stuff
 

1319
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,310
attention to the the raspberry pi stuff
give him a thumbs up as well

different as kind of the manager of the
whole thing

1334

the two studios can't be compared

1338
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
the two studios can't be compared
 

1339
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,750
the two studios can't be compared
they're not apples to apples

they're not apples to apples
 

1341
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,950
they're not apples to apples
because they're different like this is

1342
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:50,960
because they're different like this is
 

1343
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,870
because they're different like this is
the first studio we've had

1344
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
the first studio we've had
 

1345
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,669
the first studio we've had
a fireplace well yeah fireplace but this

1346
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
a fireplace well yeah fireplace but this
 

1347
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,190
a fireplace well yeah fireplace but this
is the first studio where we've had dual

1348
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
is the first studio where we've had dual
 

1349
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,310
is the first studio where we've had dual
rooms

1350
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
rooms
 

1351
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,789
rooms
like all the other stretchier rooms well

1352
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
like all the other stretchier rooms well
 

1353
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,630
like all the other stretchier rooms well
that's true yeah there's three rooms

1354
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
that's true yeah there's three rooms
 

1355
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,350
that's true yeah there's three rooms
so our other studio was all one room it

1356
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
so our other studio was all one room it
 

1357
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,190
so our other studio was all one room it
was a big open area

1358
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
was a big open area
 

1359
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,430
was a big open area
this studio is totally different like

1360
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
this studio is totally different like
 

1361
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,789
this studio is totally different like
the fact that we're in an

1362
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
the fact that we're in an
 

1363
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,830
the fact that we're in an
isolated room that's just for filming

1364
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
isolated room that's just for filming
 

1365
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,350
isolated room that's just for filming
you know you've got the the lighting

1366
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
you know you've got the the lighting
 

1367
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,990
you know you've got the the lighting
rigs the boom mic or the boom camera all

1368
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
rigs the boom mic or the boom camera all
 

1369
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,789
rigs the boom mic or the boom camera all
the kind of stuff

1370
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
the kind of stuff
 

1371
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,110
the kind of stuff
and it's separate from the server it

1372
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
and it's separate from the server it
 

1373
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,070
and it's separate from the server it
changes the dynamic

1374
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
changes the dynamic
 

1375
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,470
changes the dynamic
because the uh the the that background

1376
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
because the uh the the that background
 

1377
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,070
because the uh the the that background
white noise of the server running is

1378
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
white noise of the server running is
 

1379
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,029
white noise of the server running is
different

1380
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,039
different
 

1381
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,149
different
you can have your production studio so

1382
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159

on that end absolutely love it i do feel
like it's a little bit more work for you

1386
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
like it's a little bit more work for you
 

1387
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,990
like it's a little bit more work for you
going back and forth

1388
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
going back and forth
 

1389
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,390
going back and forth
yeah like with studio d you could sit

1390
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
yeah like with studio d you could sit
 

1391
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,110
yeah like with studio d you could sit
right there

1392
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
right there
 

1393
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,190
right there
yes and oh let's do a mic check let's do

1394
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,200
yes and oh let's do a mic check let's do
 

1395
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,950
yes and oh let's do a mic check let's do
an audio check oh something's wrong okay

1396
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
an audio check oh something's wrong okay
 

1397
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,310
an audio check oh something's wrong okay
and you could do it while almost still

1398
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
and you could do it while almost still
 

1399
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,830
and you could do it while almost still
being on camera here it's like okay hold

1400
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
being on camera here it's like okay hold

on i gotta walk around there
 

1403
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,950
on i gotta walk around there
so it's a little bit different it's a

1404
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
so it's a little bit different it's a
 

1405
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,470
so it's a little bit different it's a
little bit more steps for you which i

1406
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
little bit more steps for you which i
 

1407
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,830
little bit more steps for you which i
think works because you know you can't

1408
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
think works because you know you can't
 

1409
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,430
think works because you know you can't
your steps the closest thing i get to a

1410

all these little things that we would
never have done in an open-air studio

1478
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
never have done in an open-air studio
 

1479
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,430
never have done in an open-air studio
where it's like hey how can we evolve

1480
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,440
where it's like hey how can we evolve
 

1481
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,789
where it's like hey how can we evolve
this and make it better

1482
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
this and make it better
 

1483
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,789
this and make it better
it's just it's it's so cool because

1484
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
it's just it's it's so cool because
 

1485
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,470
it's just it's it's so cool because
we've had to change the dynamics of what

1486
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
we've had to change the dynamics of what
 

1487
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,510
we've had to change the dynamics of what
we do and how we do it

1488
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
we do and how we do it
 

1489
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,870
we do and how we do it
and it just takes it to that different

1490
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
and it just takes it to that different
 

1491
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,549
and it just takes it to that different
level i love it yeah and this is the

1492
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
level i love it yeah and this is the
 

1493
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,909
level i love it yeah and this is the
first time we've pulled down the green

1494
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
first time we've pulled down the green
 

1495
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,590
first time we've pulled down the green
screen but it seems to be working really

1496
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
screen but it seems to be working really
 

1497
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,149
screen but it seems to be working really
well

1498
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
well
 

1499
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,789
well
and so we actually have like a proper

1500
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
and so we actually have like a proper
 

1501
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,390
and so we actually have like a proper
system where we can pull down different

1502
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,400
system where we can pull down different
 

1503
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,830
system where we can pull down different
colored drapes and things like that

what do you hear jeff nothing it is
absolutely silent because we actually

1516
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
absolutely silent because we actually
 

1517
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,830
absolutely silent because we actually
have a policy here that there are no

1518
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840
have a policy here that there are no

moving parts allowed in the studio
 

1521
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,430
moving parts allowed in the studio
so that means no fans no um

1522
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
so that means no fans no um
 

1523
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,350
so that means no fans no um
computers that have moving parts so

1524
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,360
computers that have moving parts so
 

1525
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,549
computers that have moving parts so
these are the only things that move

1526
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
these are the only things that move
 

1527
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,390
these are the only things that move
everything is solid state so it's

1528
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
everything is solid state so it's
 

1529
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,909
everything is solid state so it's
absolutely silent in here

1530
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
absolutely silent in here
 

1531
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,269
absolutely silent in here
if there's anything that has a moving

1532
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
if there's anything that has a moving
 

1533
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,190
if there's anything that has a moving
part like the 3d printer it's in a

1534
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
part like the 3d printer it's in a
 

1535
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,830
part like the 3d printer it's in a
different room

1536
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
different room
 

1537
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,070
different room
right so and that isolates all the

1538
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
right so and that isolates all the
 

1539
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,269
right so and that isolates all the
sounds so sound is

1540
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
sounds so sound is
 

1541
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,230
sounds so sound is

bp-9's question going back to that

1662
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
bp-9's question going back to that
 

1663
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,870
bp-9's question going back to that
asking about having a smaller space i

1664
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
asking about having a smaller space i
 

1665
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,909
asking about having a smaller space i
should just say

1666
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
should just say
 

1667
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,950
should just say
the space appears smaller because it is

1668
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
the space appears smaller because it is
 

1669
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,310
the space appears smaller because it is
three rooms right so it's

1670
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
three rooms right so it's
 

1671
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,549
three rooms right so it's
it's almost the same amount of space

1672
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
it's almost the same amount of space
 

1673
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,149
it's almost the same amount of space
that we used to have in one big open

1674
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
that we used to have in one big open
 

1675
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:54,630
that we used to have in one big open
room

1676
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
room
 

1677
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,590
room
okay uh but it's split into three rooms

1678
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
okay uh but it's split into three rooms
 

1679
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,389
okay uh but it's split into three rooms
right so it

1680
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
right so it
 

1681
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,470
right so it
the studio space is smaller than our old

1682
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
the studio space is smaller than our old
 

1683
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,549
the studio space is smaller than our old
studio space because

1684
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
studio space because
 

1685
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,789
studio space because
there's also a production space so do

1686
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
there's also a production space so do
 

1687
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,950
there's also a production space so do
keep that in mind but the space itself

1688
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
keep that in mind but the space itself
 

1689
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,149
keep that in mind but the space itself
our floor space

1690
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
our floor space
 

1691
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,029
our floor space
is only i think 10 square feet smaller

1692
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
is only i think 10 square feet smaller
 

1693
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,149
is only i think 10 square feet smaller
it's really minimal

1694
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
it's really minimal
 

1695
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,269
it's really minimal
as far as that goes but the interesting

1696
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
as far as that goes but the interesting
 

1697

so studio d our previous space was
 

1755
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,269
so studio d our previous space was
an industrial unit who

00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
production week makes it so that we can
 

2083
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,550
production week makes it so that we can
do

2084
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560
do
 

2085
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,550
do
much bigger features so we're doing

2086
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,560
much bigger features so we're doing
 

2087
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,669
much bigger features so we're doing
things like

2088
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,679
things like
 

2089
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,069
things like
we have uh an open source nas unit

2090
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:56,079
we have uh an open source nas unit
 

2091
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,150
we have uh an open source nas unit
that's single board computer powered

2092
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
that's single board computer powered
 

2093
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,670
that's single board computer powered
and i've wanted to do this for some time

2094
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
and i've wanted to do this for some time
 

2095
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,430
and i've wanted to do this for some time
you remember i actually started a series

2096
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,440
you remember i actually started a series
 

2097
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,990
you remember i actually started a series
where i was going

2098
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
where i was going
 

2099
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,030
where i was going
to make one from an odroid xu4

2100
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,040
to make one from an odroid xu4
 

2101
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,710
to make one from an odroid xu4
and that's still coming as well but

2102
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
and that's still coming as well but
 

2103
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,470
and that's still coming as well but
that's a perfect example of

2104
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
that's a perfect example of
 

2105
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,870
that's a perfect example of
a feature that we really wanted to do

2106
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
a feature that we really wanted to do
 

2107
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,710
a feature that we really wanted to do
but because we were limited to just one

2108
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
but because we were limited to just one
 

2109
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,990
but because we were limited to just one
hour per show

2110
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
hour per show
 

2111
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,950
hour per show
and we were shooting everything live no

2112
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
and we were shooting everything live no
 

2113
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,589
and we were shooting everything live no
b-roll

00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:19,680
no like pre-production or anything like
 

2117
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,670
no like pre-production or anything like
that it made it impossible for us to get

2118
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680
that it made it impossible for us to get
 

2119
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,829
that it made it impossible for us to get
through those types of series

2120
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
through those types of series
 

2121
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,310
through those types of series
so now we've already shot the unboxing

2122
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
so now we've already shot the unboxing
 

2123
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,510
so now we've already shot the unboxing
and assembly of this

2124
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:27,520
and assembly of this
 

2125
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,349
and assembly of this
open source nas unit we've done some

2126
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
open source nas unit we've done some
 

2127
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,750
open source nas unit we've done some
testing i have a couple more weeks that

2128
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
testing i have a couple more weeks that
 

2129
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,430
testing i have a couple more weeks that
i'm going to be testing it and

2130
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,440
i'm going to be testing it and
 

2131
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,270
i'm going to be testing it and
setting it up and installing software

2132
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
setting it up and installing software
 

2133
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,870
setting it up and installing software
and putting it through all the paces and

2134
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
and putting it through all the paces and
 

2135
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,150
and putting it through all the paces and
then we're going to be demonstrating

2136
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
then we're going to be demonstrating
 

2137

00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
of the benefit of
 

2145
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,349
of the benefit of
many many weeks even so much as probably

2146
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:45,359
many many weeks even so much as probably
 

2147
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,630
many many weeks even so much as probably
about a month and a half worth of

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
all compiled into one single feature so
 

2153
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,910
all compiled into one single feature so
that's exciting looking at the 3d

2154

um where you see the thing growing out
 

2177
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,270
um where you see the thing growing out
of the 3d printer and it just

grows you showed that two weeks ago i
 

2181
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,430
grows you showed that two weeks ago i
think on the show we use it all the time

ever since i got the 3d printer and
 

2185
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,030
ever since i got the 3d printer and
created it was when you showed the uh

printed some parts for the server

2208
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
printed some parts for the server
 

2209
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,790
printed some parts for the server
in order to allow those drives to

2210
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:42,800
in order to allow those drives to
 

2211
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,390
in order to allow those drives to
connect directly to the backplane

2212
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:44,400
connect directly to the backplane
 

2213
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,310
connect directly to the backplane
and you saw the the pieces just kind of

2214
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
and you saw the the pieces just kind of
 

2215
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,230
and you saw the the pieces just kind of
growing out of the build plate

2216
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
growing out of the build plate
 

2217

how i do that
 

2221
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,670
how i do that

it has rgb leds in it
 

2505
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,910
it has rgb leds in it
okay and the case will light up based on

2506
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
okay and the case will light up based on
 

2507
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,349
okay and the case will light up based on
the state of your network so if

pi's and they

2620
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:16,319
pi's and they
 

2621
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,910
pi's and they
assemble it and then they don't know

2622
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
assemble it and then they don't know
 

2623

2627
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,470
then i try to find projects it's like
okay well now you can program

2628
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
okay well now you can program
 

2629
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,829
okay well now you can program
stuff and it's like well but i can

2630
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
stuff and it's like well but i can
 

2631
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,470
stuff and it's like well but i can
program on the computer and it's faster

extruder
so that means that you can only have one

2708
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,240
so that means that you can only have one
 

2709
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,829
so that means that you can only have one
color filament coming out of the

2710
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
color filament coming out of the
 

2711
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,550
color filament coming out of the
extruder

2712
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,560
extruder
 

2713
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,030
extruder
at any one time but you can change the

2714
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,040
at any one time but you can change the
 

2715
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,670
at any one time but you can change the
filament

2716
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,680
filament
 

2717
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,910
filament
mid print so i tried that that was my

2718
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:49,920
mid print so i tried that that was my
 

2719
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,670
mid print so i tried that that was my
first step so i printed

2720
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:51,680
first step so i printed
 

2721
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,109
first step so i printed
an ornament just a plain red ornament

2722
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,119
an ornament just a plain red ornament
 

2723
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,230
an ornament just a plain red ornament
and then i printed on top of that

2724
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,240
and then i printed on top of that
 

2725
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,270
and then i printed on top of that
so i in in cura i then took text

2726
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
so i in in cura i then took text
 

2727
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,349
so i in in cura i then took text
and turned it into a 3d print and i

2728
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
and turned it into a 3d print and i
 

2729
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,309
and turned it into a 3d print and i
elevated it

2730
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
elevated it
 

2731
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,069
elevated it
five layers which was the height of the

2732
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:06,079
five layers which was the height of the
 

2733
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,230
five layers which was the height of the
ornament and actually printed directly

2734
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,240
ornament and actually printed directly
 

2735
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,349
ornament and actually printed directly
onto

2736
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
onto
 

2737
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,349
onto
the ornament with white text right so

2738
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
the ornament with white text right so
 

2739
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,030
the ornament with white text right so
i've got a red ornament with white text

2740
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,040
i've got a red ornament with white text
 

2741
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,230
i've got a red ornament with white text
on it and it worked perfectly yeah it

2742
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
on it and it worked perfectly yeah it
 

2743
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,150
on it and it worked perfectly yeah it
looked great yeah so then i took it one

2744
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,160
looked great yeah so then i took it one
 

2745
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,190
looked great yeah so then i took it one
step further

2746
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
step further
 

2747
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,710
step further
and i took my text and i turned it into

2748
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:20,720
and i took my text and i turned it into
 

2749
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,670
and i took my text and i turned it into
a hole they call it so basically it's an

2750
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
a hole they call it so basically it's an
 

2751
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,710
a hole they call it so basically it's an
inverse of

2752
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
inverse of
 

2753
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,550
inverse of
something that you would print it it is

2754
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:26,560
something that you would print it it is
 

2755
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,550
something that you would print it it is
anti-print right so i took

2756
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
anti-print right so i took
 

2757
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,950
anti-print right so i took
the thing that i was printing and i

2758
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:30,960
the thing that i was printing and i
 

2759
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,309
the thing that i was printing and i
pushed the text

2760
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:32,319
pushed the text
 

2761
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,470
pushed the text
down into it okay so that it would

2762
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,480
down into it okay so that it would
 

2763
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,589
down into it okay so that it would
create a hole

2764
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:35,599
create a hole
 

2765
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,670
create a hole
in the first print so then when i

2766
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:37,680
in the first print so then when i
 

2767
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,670
in the first print so then when i
printed the red thing there's a hole

2768
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:39,680
printed the red thing there's a hole
 

2769
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,750
printed the red thing there's a hole
and then i switched the filament and i

2770
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
and then i switched the filament and i
 

2771
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,670
and then i switched the filament and i
put it inside of the hole

2772
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:43,680
put it inside of the hole
 

2773
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,390
put it inside of the hole
so i put my 3d printer inside the hole

2774
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
so i put my 3d printer inside the hole
 

2775
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,829
so i put my 3d printer inside the hole
so then i printed the white

2776
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:47,839
so then i printed the white
 

2777
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,190
so then i printed the white
into the hole and so it's

2778
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200
into the hole and so it's
 

2779
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,309
into the hole and so it's
perfectly flush that's how you did it

2780
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:54,319
perfectly flush that's how you did it
 

2781
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,870
perfectly flush that's how you did it
yeah very cool but but it looks like a

2782
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
yeah very cool but but it looks like a
 

2783
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,390
yeah very cool but but it looks like a
multi-color print yeah it does

2784
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400
multi-color print yeah it does
 

2785
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,750
multi-color print yeah it does
really i'm just changing the filament

2786
00:45:59,750 --> 00:45:59,760
really i'm just changing the filament
 

2787
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,230
really i'm just changing the filament
and programming the g-code in such a way

2788
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,240
and programming the g-code in such a way
 

2789
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,829
and programming the g-code in such a way
that it that it actually prints in the

2790
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:03,839
that it that it actually prints in the
 

2791
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:04,710
that it that it actually prints in the
right spot

2792
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
right spot
 

2793
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,390
right spot
that's so cool make sure you line things

2794
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:06,400
that's so cool make sure you line things
 

2795
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,950
that's so cool make sure you line things
up just perfectly kids i love that

2796
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
up just perfectly kids i love that
 

2797
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,470
up just perfectly kids i love that
so good uh so bp9 wants to know about

2798

so good uh so bp9 wants to know about
 

2799
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,190
so good uh so bp9 wants to know about
learning

2800
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,200
learning
 

2801
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,230
learning
uh lua on mind test for

2802
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:16,240
uh lua on mind test for
 

2803
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,950
uh lua on mind test for
for luke uh might be fun lua is a

2804
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
for luke uh might be fun lua is a
 

2805
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,069
for luke uh might be fun lua is a
programming language

2806
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:20,079
programming language
 

2807
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,790
programming language
oh okay and mine test is a minecraft

2808
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:22,800

yes yeah um mango fox used to do some
 

2813
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:27,990
yes yeah um mango fox used to do some
mind test stuff

2814
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
mind test stuff
 

2815
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,829
mind test stuff
yep yep yeah so i do remember that we

2816
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
yep yep yeah so i do remember that we
 

2817
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,190
yep yep yeah so i do remember that we
had a program uh

2818

had a program uh
 

2819
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,510
had a program uh
here on category five the pixel shadow

2820
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:33,520
here on category five the pixel shadow
 

2821
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,030
here on category five the pixel shadow
yes which she did when she was younger

yeah
and uh mind test is a really

2826
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,560
and uh mind test is a really
 

2827
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,190
and uh mind test is a really
really great version like a open source

2828
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
really great version like a open source
 

2829
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,990
really great version like a open source
version of

2830
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
version of
 

2831
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,829
version of
what you would say is like a clone of

2832
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
what you would say is like a clone of
 

2833
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,430
what you would say is like a clone of
minecraft it's not really a clone of

2834
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:45,440
minecraft it's not really a clone of
 

2835
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,309
minecraft it's not really a clone of
minecraft

2836
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
minecraft
 

2837
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,790
minecraft
they come from the same base but um but

2838
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:48,800
they come from the same base but um but
 

2839
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,910
they come from the same base but um but
they're very very similar

2840
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:49,920
they're very very similar
 

2841
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,349
they're very very similar
yeah but with lua you could be

2842
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:51,359
yeah but with lua you could be
 

2843
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,190
yeah but with lua you could be
programming your own modules for it

2844
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,200
programming your own modules for it
 

2845
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,710
programming your own modules for it
creating very very customized

2846
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:56,720
creating very very customized
 

2847
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,470
creating very very customized
um worlds right okay yeah that's cool

um worlds right okay yeah that's cool
i'll have to take a look at that i know

2850
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
i'll have to take a look at that i know
 

2851
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,990
i'll have to take a look at that i know
luke plays mind test sometimes oh yeah

2852
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
luke plays mind test sometimes oh yeah
 

2853

yeah
we should do like a mind test lan party

2856
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960
we should do like a mind test lan party
 

2857
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,230
we should do like a mind test lan party
oh my gosh

forward to with category five
 

2875
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,309
forward to with category five
so we're coming up on 2021 where we know

2876
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
so we're coming up on 2021 where we know
 

2877
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,790
so we're coming up on 2021 where we know
that it's going to be better than 2020.

2878
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:30,800
that it's going to be better than 2020.
 

2879
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,589
that it's going to be better than 2020.
what's on the right honestly for me i

2880
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:33,599
what's on the right honestly for me i
 

2881
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,030
what's on the right honestly for me i
want to expand

2882

00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
my knowledge base to the point where
 

2885
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,510
my knowledge base to the point where
it's not on all on your shoulders that's

2886
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:41,520
it's not on all on your shoulders that's
 

2887

a mouthpiece that can add banter but i
 

2899
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,270
a mouthpiece that can add banter but i
don't have a lot of time in

2900
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,280
don't have a lot of time in
 

2901
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,589
don't have a lot of time in
my life to learn these things because my

2902
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
my life to learn these things because my
 

2903
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,390
my life to learn these things because my
job doesn't

2904
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
job doesn't
 

2905
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,109
job doesn't
go into the realm of tech that often i

2906
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:01,119
go into the realm of tech that often i
 

2907
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,030
go into the realm of tech that often i
mean it's starting to now but

2908
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
mean it's starting to now but
 

2909
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,990
mean it's starting to now but
i want to be able to know some things

2910
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
i want to be able to know some things
 

2911
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,030
i want to be able to know some things
where it's like hey

2912
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040
where it's like hey
 

2913
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,710
where it's like hey
robbie i can do the feature this week

2914
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
robbie i can do the feature this week
 

2915
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,829
robbie i can do the feature this week
and we're like hey this is great i'm

2916
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:09,839
and we're like hey this is great i'm
 

2917
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,030
and we're like hey this is great i'm
going to sit in the production studio

2918
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
going to sit in the production studio
 

2919
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,230
going to sit in the production studio
and produce things

2920
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:12,240
and produce things
 

2921
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,549
and produce things
that's what i'm hoping to do uh it's

2922
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:14,559
that's what i'm hoping to do uh it's
 

2923
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,390
that's what i'm hoping to do uh it's
just it's a matter of time that's cool

2924
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
just it's a matter of time that's cool
 

2925
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,790
just it's a matter of time that's cool
so yeah henry bailey brown really hit on

2926
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
so yeah henry bailey brown really hit on
 

2927
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,430
so yeah henry bailey brown really hit on
that yes

2928
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440
that yes
 

2929
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,990
that yes
when he brought in his feature which was

2930
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22,000
when he brought in his feature which was
 

2931
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,950
when he brought in his feature which was
um

2932
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
um
 

2933
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,910
um
when he 3d scans using his drone so he

2934
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:25,920
when he 3d scans using his drone so he
 

2935
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,430
when he 3d scans using his drone so he
shot all that and brought it into the

2936
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
shot all that and brought it into the
 

2937
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,309
shot all that and brought it into the
studio

2938
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
studio
 

2939
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,190
studio
ready to go and then we sat down and and

2940
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
ready to go and then we sat down and and
 

2941
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,710
ready to go and then we sat down and and
kind of added the bumpers on either end

2942
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
kind of added the bumpers on either end
 

2943
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,990
kind of added the bumpers on either end
and talked about what it was we were

2944
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
and talked about what it was we were
 

2945
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,549
and talked about what it was we were
seeing

2946
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
seeing
 

2947
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,150
seeing
right but that was all something that he

2948
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,160
right but that was all something that he
 

2949
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,829
right but that was all something that he
brought in and that that's really really

2950
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:37,839
brought in and that that's really really
 

2951
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,670
brought in and that that's really really
cool so yeah that's why i'm working on

2952
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:39,680
cool so yeah that's why i'm working on
 

2953
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,349
cool so yeah that's why i'm working on
uh the circuit boards with luke

2954
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,359
uh the circuit boards with luke
 

2955
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,950
uh the circuit boards with luke
yeah so that we you know we can go down

2956
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:42,960
yeah so that we you know we can go down
 

2957
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,109
yeah so that we you know we can go down
that road get you some b-roll and then

2958
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
that road get you some b-roll and then
 

2959
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:45,829
that road get you some b-roll and then
we could

2960
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:45,839
we could
 

2961
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,390
we could
just build this circuit board it's uh

2962
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:48,400
just build this circuit board it's uh
 

2963
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,990
just build this circuit board it's uh
you know so it's things like that where

2964
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,000
you know so it's things like that where
 

2965
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,430
you know so it's things like that where
yeah that's what i would like i'd love

2966
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
yeah that's what i would like i'd love
 

2967
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,790
yeah that's what i would like i'd love
to see that stuff too

2968
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:52,800
to see that stuff too
 

2969
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,309
to see that stuff too
and and i looked up when you were

2970
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:54,319
and and i looked up when you were
 

2971
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,030
and and i looked up when you were
talking about creating your own pcbs

2972
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:57,040
talking about creating your own pcbs
 

2973
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,790
talking about creating your own pcbs
and you mentioned using a laser printer

2974
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:58,800
and you mentioned using a laser printer
 

2975
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,230
and you mentioned using a laser printer
and so i'm like what are you talking

2976
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:00,240
and so i'm like what are you talking
 

2977
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:00,870
and so i'm like what are you talking
about

2978
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880
about
 

2979
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,390
about
so i actually looked into this and it's

2980
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
so i actually looked into this and it's
 

2981
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,589
so i actually looked into this and it's
a way to like use the ink from a laser

2982
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:05,599
a way to like use the ink from a laser
 

2983
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,030
a way to like use the ink from a laser
printer to actually

2984
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,040
printer to actually
 

2985
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,150
printer to actually
like dissolve parts of the pcb yeah

2986
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
like dissolve parts of the pcb yeah
 

2987
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,870
like dissolve parts of the pcb yeah
so that it actually creates yeah the

2988
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
so that it actually creates yeah the
 

2989
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,670
so that it actually creates yeah the
circuit

2990
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:13,680
circuit
 

2991
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,549
circuit
it's so neat how does that even work i

2992
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:16,559
it's so neat how does that even work i
 

2993
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,069
it's so neat how does that even work i
don't know and

2994
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:18,079
don't know and
 

2995
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,390
don't know and
but magic well yeah and that's the thing

2996
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:20,400
but magic well yeah and that's the thing
 

2997
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,069
but magic well yeah and that's the thing
like i didn't what seems like magic i

2998
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079
like i didn't what seems like magic i
 

2999
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,270
like i didn't what seems like magic i
didn't want to look into the chemistry

3000
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
didn't want to look into the chemistry
 

3001
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,470
didn't want to look into the chemistry
of it because i'm like i just don't want

3002
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
of it because i'm like i just don't want
 

3003
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,190
of it because i'm like i just don't want
to like

3004
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
to like
 

3005
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,710
to like
this is cool enough but advanced enough

3006
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:26,720
this is cool enough but advanced enough
 

3007
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,630
this is cool enough but advanced enough
as it is yeah but when you print the

3008
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
as it is yeah but when you print the
 

3009
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,230
as it is yeah but when you print the
design on the paper and then

3010
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,240
design on the paper and then
 

3011
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,390
design on the paper and then
and it has to be laser it can't be color

3012
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
and it has to be laser it can't be color
 

3013
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,910
and it has to be laser it can't be color
and then when you put it on the board

3014
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
and then when you put it on the board
 

3015
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,270
and then when you put it on the board
and then there's the chemicals that you

3016
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
and then there's the chemicals that you
 

3017
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,710
and then there's the chemicals that you
use that are just the chemicals you can

3018
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
use that are just the chemicals you can
 

3019
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,390
use that are just the chemicals you can
get at the store interacts with the ink

3020
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400
get at the store interacts with the ink
 

3021
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,270
get at the store interacts with the ink
yeah and then it creates the actual so

3022
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:41,280
yeah and then it creates the actual so
 

3023
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,470
yeah and then it creates the actual so
conduit that the

3024
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:42,480
conduit that the
 

3025
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,710
conduit that the
electrical signal passes on and then

3026
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
electrical signal passes on and then
 

3027
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,950
electrical signal passes on and then
it's just a matter of drilling the holes

3028
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
it's just a matter of drilling the holes
 

3029
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,270
it's just a matter of drilling the holes
and then you put your various components

3030
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
and then you put your various components
 

3031
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,309
and then you put your various components
in and solder them and so

3032
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
in and solder them and so
 

3033
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,390
in and solder them and so
so neat it's a way to make circuit

3034
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,400
so neat it's a way to make circuit
 

3035
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,670
so neat it's a way to make circuit
boards at home

3036
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,680
boards at home
 

3037
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,950
boards at home
without having the professional circuit

3038
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
without having the professional circuit
 

3039
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,990
without having the professional circuit
board printers because

3040
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,000
board printers because
 

3041
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,230
board printers because
you can just design it on i think what i

3042
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:00,240
you can just design it on i think what i
 

3043
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,630
you can just design it on i think what i
think it's kcad is the program i've got

3044
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
think it's kcad is the program i've got
 

3045
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,230
think it's kcad is the program i've got
okay um where you can design your

3046
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,240
okay um where you can design your
 

3047
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,990
okay um where you can design your
circuit board and

3048
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
circuit board and
 

3049
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,390
circuit board and
you know each of the you know the little

3050
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
you know each of the you know the little
 

3051
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,910
you know each of the you know the little
modules and components that go in it

3052
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:09,920
modules and components that go in it
 

3053
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,270
modules and components that go in it
that you solder it's like okay well this

3054
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:11,280
that you solder it's like okay well this
 

3055
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,069
that you solder it's like okay well this
resistor's here

3056
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:12,079
resistor's here
 

3057
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,470
resistor's here
and this is going to be there yeah and

3058
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,480
and this is going to be there yeah and
 

3059
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,670
and this is going to be there yeah and
then you just print it off on paper and

3060
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:15,680
then you just print it off on paper and
 

3061
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,390
then you just print it off on paper and
do it and so

3062
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,400
do it and so
 

3063
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,549
do it and so
it's it's pretty pretty neat it's

3064
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
it's it's pretty pretty neat it's
 

3065
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,829
it's it's pretty pretty neat it's
impressive and

3066
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:19,839
impressive and
 

3067
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,670
impressive and
blew my mind when i came across it i

3068
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
blew my mind when i came across it i
 

3069
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,030
blew my mind when i came across it i

show
can do in 2021 when these types of

3150
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
can do in 2021 when these types of
 

3151
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,950
can do in 2021 when these types of
things are not

3152

things are not
 

3153
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,870
things are not
a consideration or at least not uh

3154
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:52,880
a consideration or at least not uh
 

3155
