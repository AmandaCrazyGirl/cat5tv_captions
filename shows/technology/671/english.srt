331
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,990
evolved the show over the past 14 years
and we couldn't do that without the

332
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
and we couldn't do that without the

yes do you remember that discussion yeah
on my raspberry pi

348
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
on my raspberry pi
 

349
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,510
on my raspberry pi
3 yeah my kids had been asking for my

350
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520

minecraft server so we had some uh
 

353
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,990
minecraft server so we had some uh
subscription-based services online some

354
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
subscription-based services online some
 

355
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,790
subscription-based services online some
paid

356
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
paid
 

357
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,150
paid
and then i'm like well you know what

358
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
and then i'm like well you know what
 

359

it's just it's just a couple of us i
 

361
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,430
it's just it's just a couple of us i
really don't want to pay for this

362
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
really don't want to pay for this
 

363
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,909
really don't want to pay for this
monthly so then we found a free one

364
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
monthly so then we found a free one
 

365
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,309
monthly so then we found a free one
i was like i gotta log in gotta turn it

366
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
i was like i gotta log in gotta turn it
 

367
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,070
i was like i gotta log in gotta turn it
right off

368
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
right off
 

369
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,430
right off
like what if i could just make my own

370
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
like what if i could just make my own
 

371
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,430
like what if i could just make my own
server on a raspberry pi 3.

372
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
server on a raspberry pi 3.
 

373
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,870
server on a raspberry pi 3.
so i tried it wasn't great it didn't

374
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
so i tried it wasn't great it didn't
 

375
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,870
so i tried it wasn't great it didn't
perform well like it took forever to

376
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
perform well like it took forever to
 

377
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,629
perform well like it took forever to
load in very laggy

378
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
load in very laggy
 

379
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,390
load in very laggy
you know creeper comes along blows you

380
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
you know creeper comes along blows you
 

381
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,990
you know creeper comes along blows you
up and it takes like 30 seconds

382
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
up and it takes like 30 seconds
 

383
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,990
up and it takes like 30 seconds
for you to realize you've been killed um

384
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
for you to realize you've been killed um
 

385
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,510
for you to realize you've been killed um
oh my yeah it was not good

386
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
oh my yeah it was not good
 

387
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,230
oh my yeah it was not good
so then i tried the odroid xu4 yeah and

388
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
so then i tried the odroid xu4 yeah and
 

389
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,189
so then i tried the odroid xu4 yeah and
it was better

390
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
it was better
 

391
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,990
it was better
okay but not great yeah the xu4 is a

392
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
okay but not great yeah the xu4 is a
 

393
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,749
okay but not great yeah the xu4 is a
fantastic board but it still only has

394
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
fantastic board but it still only has
 

395
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,710
fantastic board but it still only has
two gigs of ram

396
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
two gigs of ram
 

397
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,390
two gigs of ram
right and i think that's the big problem

398
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
right and i think that's the big problem
 

399
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,469
right and i think that's the big problem
that is like the bare

400
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
that is like the bare
 

401
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,629
that is like the bare
absolute minimum for a minecraft server

402
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
absolute minimum for a minecraft server
 

403
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,990
absolute minimum for a minecraft server
and when you realize that

404
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
and when you realize that
 

405
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,629
and when you realize that
hey if you are just meeting the minimum

406
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
hey if you are just meeting the minimum
 

407
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,150
hey if you are just meeting the minimum
you're not going to see the performance

408
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
you're not going to see the performance
 

409
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,029
you're not going to see the performance
that you could have

410
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
that you could have
 

411
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,950
that you could have
and it probably would have been okay for

412
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
and it probably would have been okay for
 

413
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,390
and it probably would have been okay for
a single user

414
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
a single user
 

415
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,230
a single user
like if i was playing a single yeah sure

416
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
like if i was playing a single yeah sure
 

417
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,749
like if i was playing a single yeah sure
yeah uh but you want something for the

418
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
yeah uh but you want something for the
 

419
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,670
yeah uh but you want something for the

425
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,749

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
really cool stuff yeah that's
 

429
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,790
really cool stuff yeah that's
you know lots of red yeah so that takes

430
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
you know lots of red yeah so that takes
 

431
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,550
you know lots of red yeah so that takes
a lot of processing power and you need a

432
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
a lot of processing power and you need a
 

433
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,110
a lot of processing power and you need a
lot of

434
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
lot of
 

435
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,510
lot of
you know ram for that so it wasn't great

436
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
you know ram for that so it wasn't great
 

437
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,510
you know ram for that so it wasn't great
so you know we debated on the raspberry

438
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
so you know we debated on the raspberry
 

439
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:23,909
so you know we debated on the raspberry
pi

440
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
pi
 

441
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,270

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,990
and i think one of the things that
appeals to me

448
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
appeals to me
 

449
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,670
appeals to me
most about hosting my own minecraft

online services
 

457
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,510

and it's not about not having the
 

503
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,189
and it's not about not having the
minecraft server it's about

504
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
minecraft server it's about
 

505
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,630
minecraft server it's about
they put a lot of work and a lot of

506

00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
they lose access to that
 

517
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,110
they lose access to that
so using a raspberry pi 4 the question

518
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
so using a raspberry pi 4 the question
 

519
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,590
so using a raspberry pi 4 the question
becomes well is it powerful enough

520
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
becomes well is it powerful enough
 

521
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,070
becomes well is it powerful enough
right you talked about the pi 3 which is

522
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
right you talked about the pi 3 which is
 

523
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,110
right you talked about the pi 3 which is
definitely not

524
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
definitely not
 

525
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,110
definitely not
one gig of ram no way odroid xu4

526
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
one gig of ram no way odroid xu4
 

527
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,150
one gig of ram no way odroid xu4
you're approaching a reasonably usable

528
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
you're approaching a reasonably usable
 

529
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,630
you're approaching a reasonably usable
minecraft server but you're still

530
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
minecraft server but you're still
 

531
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,310
minecraft server but you're still
limited by that two gigs of ram

532
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
limited by that two gigs of ram
 

533
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,110
limited by that two gigs of ram
yeah throw a raspberry pi 4 in the mix

534
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
yeah throw a raspberry pi 4 in the mix
 

535
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,509
yeah throw a raspberry pi 4 in the mix
with

536
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
with
 

537
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,269
with
four gigs or eight gigs of ram which one

538
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
four gigs or eight gigs of ram which one
 

539
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,190
four gigs or eight gigs of ram which one
do you have four gigs you have the four

540
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
do you have four gigs you have the four
 

541
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,590
do you have four gigs you have the four
okay

542
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
okay
 

543
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,190
okay
yeah i'm looking at buying the eight gig

544
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200

 

545
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,190

well let's take a look at my raspberry

546
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
well let's take a look at my raspberry
 

547
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,230
well let's take a look at my raspberry
pi 4

548
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
pi 4
 

549
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,269
pi 4
and what we're going to do is we're

550
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
and what we're going to do is we're
 

551
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,150
and what we're going to do is we're
going to actually see if a raspberry pi

552
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
going to actually see if a raspberry pi
 

553
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,430
going to actually see if a raspberry pi
4 is capable of doing this for us

554
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
4 is capable of doing this for us
 

555
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,949
4 is capable of doing this for us
running a minecraft server

556
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
running a minecraft server
 

557
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,110
running a minecraft server
and i don't mean just running one but is

558
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
and i don't mean just running one but is
 

559
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,310
and i don't mean just running one but is
it going to be good enough

560
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
it going to be good enough
 

561
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,430
it going to be good enough
yes all right so step one is that we're

562
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
yes all right so step one is that we're
 

563
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,910
yes all right so step one is that we're
going to

564

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,389
video is in three hours long
so this is basically the automated

806
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
so this is basically the automated
 

807
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,550
so this is basically the automated
process of how i was

808
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
process of how i was
 

809
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,790
process of how i was
able to get minecraft up and running on

810
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
able to get minecraft up and running on
 

811
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,710
able to get minecraft up and running on
a raspberry pi as well as possible so it

812
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
a raspberry pi as well as possible so it
 

813
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,470
a raspberry pi as well as possible so it
overclocks it automatically does a whole

814
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
overclocks it automatically does a whole
 

815
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,350
overclocks it automatically does a whole
bunch of stuff

816
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
bunch of stuff
 

817
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,189
bunch of stuff
detects how much ram you have what kind

818
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
detects how much ram you have what kind
 

819
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,629
detects how much ram you have what kind
of operating system you're running and

820
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
of operating system you're running and

so on and so forth

822
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
so on and so forth

825
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,509
i'd encourage you anytime you're going
to run any kind of installer script hey

826
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
to run any kind of installer script hey
 

827
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,269
to run any kind of installer script hey
look at the code

828
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
look at the code
 

829
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,949
look at the code
find out what it's actually doing and

830
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
find out what it's actually doing and
 

831
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,189
find out what it's actually doing and
and see this also gives you a chance to

832
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
and see this also gives you a chance to
 

833
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,629
and see this also gives you a chance to
trust what i'm doing here

834
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
trust what i'm doing here
 

835
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,470
trust what i'm doing here
but also it just is really good

836
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
but also it just is really good
 

837
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,829
but also it just is really good
information and shows you

838
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
information and shows you
 

839
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,269
information and shows you
exactly what i'm doing but this is

840
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
exactly what i'm doing but this is
 

841
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,389
exactly what i'm doing but this is
basically just the

842
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
basically just the
 

843
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,750
basically just the
installer the script that's going to do

844
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
installer the script that's going to do
 

845
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,670
installer the script that's going to do
it it is well commented so

846
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
it it is well commented so
 

847
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,949

going to run great but do keep in mind
 

947
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,350
going to run great but do keep in mind
if you've gone and bought the 8 gig

you have to use the 64-bit os but why am

952
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
you have to use the 64-bit os but why am
 

953
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,269
you have to use the 64-bit os but why am
i using the 32-bit os then

954
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
i using the 32-bit os then
 

955
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,790
i using the 32-bit os then
it's because they haven't released the

956
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
it's because they haven't released the
 

957
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,269
it's because they haven't released the
64-bit light os yet so

958
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
64-bit light os yet so
 

959
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,509
64-bit light os yet so
that is the desktop is currently in beta

960
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
that is the desktop is currently in beta
 

961
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,350
that is the desktop is currently in beta
and we will inevitably see the light

962
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
and we will inevitably see the light
 

963
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,629
and we will inevitably see the light
version of

964
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639

watch for it you can install this on
 

969
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,470
watch for it you can install this on
your pi right now then back it up and

your pi right now then back it up and
 

971
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,470
your pi right now then back it up and
then reinstall with the 64 bit once it's

972
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
then reinstall with the 64 bit once it's
 

973
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,509
then reinstall with the 64 bit once it's
released and you'll be able to take

974
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
released and you'll be able to take
 

975
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,030

in the meantime it's going to overclock

978
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
in the meantime it's going to overclock
 

979
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,269
in the meantime it's going to overclock
to 1.9 gigahertz the default is 1.5 so

980
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279

981
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,269
to 1.9 gigahertz the default is 1.5 so
that's pretty good but conservative

00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
that's pretty good but conservative
 

983

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,310
gameplay performance notice that we've
got the cpu and ram stats at the bottom

1126
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
got the cpu and ram stats at the bottom
 

1127
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,350
got the cpu and ram stats at the bottom
of your screen

1128
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
of your screen
 

1129
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,470
of your screen
and that'll remain for the whole

1130
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
and that'll remain for the whole
 

1131
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,789
and that'll remain for the whole
demonstration all right so i'm here

1132
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
demonstration all right so i'm here
 

1133
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,430
demonstration all right so i'm here
at jeff's place and just going to kind

1134
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
at jeff's place and just going to kind
 

1135
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,430
at jeff's place and just going to kind
of quickly run around to show you the

1136
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
of quickly run around to show you the
 

1137
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,630
of quickly run around to show you the
you know that this is performing very

1138
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
you know that this is performing very
 

1139
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,830
you know that this is performing very
very well

1140
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
very well
 

1141
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,029
very well
so this is a raspberry pi 4 is the

1142
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
so this is a raspberry pi 4 is the
 

1143
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,549
so this is a raspberry pi 4 is the
server and

1144
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
server and
 

1145
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,909
server and
i've overclocked it to 1.95 gigahertz

1146
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
i've overclocked it to 1.95 gigahertz
 

1147
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,110
i've overclocked it to 1.95 gigahertz
it's got four gigs of ram and a kingston

1148
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
it's got four gigs of ram and a kingston
 

1149
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,549
it's got four gigs of ram and a kingston
uh endurance micro sd card all right so

1150
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
uh endurance micro sd card all right so
 

1151
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,750
uh endurance micro sd card all right so
i wanted to show

1152
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
i wanted to show
 

1153
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,830
i wanted to show
the performance with just me uh

1154
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
the performance with just me uh
 

1155
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,270
the performance with just me uh
everything looks pretty good and and

1156
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,280
everything looks pretty good and and
 

1157
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,669
everything looks pretty good and and
here at jeff's place jeff i guess things

1158
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
here at jeff's place jeff i guess things
 

1159
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,950
here at jeff's place jeff i guess things
should be performing

1160
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
should be performing
 

1161
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,669
should be performing
it poorly here if anywhere right because

1162
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
it poorly here if anywhere right because
 

1163
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,470
it poorly here if anywhere right because
you've got all these

1164
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
you've got all these
 

1165
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,270
you've got all these
animals and stuff and that's correct

1166
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
animals and stuff and that's correct
 

1167
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,549
animals and stuff and that's correct
yeah i tried to

1168
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
yeah i tried to
 

1169
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,190
yeah i tried to
to to build a base that was busy enough

1170
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
to to build a base that was busy enough
 

1171
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,549
to to build a base that was busy enough
with lots of elements and so there's

1172
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
with lots of elements and so there's
 

1173
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,750
with lots of elements and so there's
lots of animals making noise in the

1174
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
lots of animals making noise in the
 

1175
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,110
lots of animals making noise in the
background i want to try and tax the

1176
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
background i want to try and tax the
 

1177
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,310
background i want to try and tax the
surfer out

1178
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
surfer out
 

1179
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,470
surfer out
yeah okay so let's uh let's see what

1180
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
yeah okay so let's uh let's see what
 

1181
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,750
yeah okay so let's uh let's see what
happens as we start to add players

1182
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
happens as we start to add players
 

1183
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,710
happens as we start to add players
because i think that was one of the

1184
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
because i think that was one of the
 

1185
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,990
because i think that was one of the
questions that came up

1186
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
questions that came up
 

1187
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,590
questions that came up
when you and i were first discussing

1188
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
when you and i were first discussing
 

1189
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,430
when you and i were first discussing
this project was

1190
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
this project was
 

1191
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,870
this project was
you know what how many players are going

1192
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
you know what how many players are going
 

1193
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,270
you know what how many players are going
to be able to come on here

1194
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
to be able to come on here
 

1195
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,070
to be able to come on here
all right and uh i think i'm last to

1196
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
all right and uh i think i'm last to

um our viewers can see that the

1338
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
um our viewers can see that the
 

1339
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,990
um our viewers can see that the
performance is

1340
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
performance is
 

1341
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,190
performance is
like this is probably better than uh

1342
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
like this is probably better than uh
 

1343
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,630
like this is probably better than uh
more timer you would know because you've

1344
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
more timer you would know because you've
 

1345
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,630
more timer you would know because you've
played on a lot of online servers

1346
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
played on a lot of online servers
 

1347
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,350
played on a lot of online servers
how's the performance of our minecraft

1348
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
how's the performance of our minecraft
 

1349
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,430
how's the performance of our minecraft
server on a raspberry pi

1350
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
server on a raspberry pi
 

1351
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,110
server on a raspberry pi
uh compared to some of those online

1352
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
uh compared to some of those online
 

1353
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,510
uh compared to some of those online
servers

1354
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
servers
 

1355
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,710
servers
better actually this is better yeah i

1356
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
better actually this is better yeah i
 

1357
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,590
better actually this is better yeah i
would agree

1358
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
would agree
 

1359
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,430
would agree
i i have that's what i've been told

1360
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
i i have that's what i've been told
 

1361
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,830
i i have that's what i've been told
there's way less players though but i

1362
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840
there's way less players though but i
 

1363
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,470
there's way less players though but i
mean

1364
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
mean
 

1365
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,990
mean
there i have a free server that uh

1366
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
there i have a free server that uh
 

1367
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,110
there i have a free server that uh
i've used with my kids and

1368
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
i've used with my kids and
 

1369
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,830
i've used with my kids and
we get lag issues when it's just the

1370
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
we get lag issues when it's just the
 

1371
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,990
we get lag issues when it's just the
four of us on

1372
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
four of us on
 

1373
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,549
four of us on
so the fact that this is a raspberry pi

1374
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
so the fact that this is a raspberry pi
 

1375
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,029
so the fact that this is a raspberry pi
and there's

1376
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
and there's
 

1377
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,230
and there's
what nine of us it's sorry my

1378
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
what nine of us it's sorry my
 

1379

a free server that i use with my kids
 

1389
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,830
a free server that i use with my kids
oh okay like online like a cloud server

1390
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
oh okay like online like a cloud server
 

1391
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,870
oh okay like online like a cloud server
online okay

1392
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
online okay
 

1393
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,950
online okay
yeah and it is um it can be quite laggy

1394
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
yeah and it is um it can be quite laggy
 

1395
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,669
yeah and it is um it can be quite laggy
sometimes

1396
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
sometimes
 

1397
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,149
sometimes
when it's just the four of us so this

1398
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
when it's just the four of us so this
 

1399
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:18,870
when it's just the four of us so this
performs

1400
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
performs
 

1401
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,390
performs
exceptionally better than that and i've

1402
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
exceptionally better than that and i've
 

1403
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,710
exceptionally better than that and i've
i've also paid for servers where it's

1404
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
i've also paid for servers where it's
 

1405
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,750
i've also paid for servers where it's
you know 60

1406
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
you know 60
 

1407
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,789
you know 60
a year and this is

1408
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
a year and this is
 

1409
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,669
a year and this is
better performance you don't have much

1410
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
better performance you don't have much
 

1411
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,590
better performance you don't have much
in the way of armor

1412
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
in the way of armor
 

1413
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,029
in the way of armor
but uh are you interested in following

1414
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
but uh are you interested in following
 

1415
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,590
but uh are you interested in following
me into the nether just for a quick tour

1416
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
me into the nether just for a quick tour
 

1417
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,029
me into the nether just for a quick tour
uh sure because that should be a

1418
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
uh sure because that should be a
 

1419
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,470
uh sure because that should be a
performance hit right that's loading

1420
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
performance hit right that's loading
 

1421
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,510
performance hit right that's loading
another world

1422
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
another world
 

1423
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,870
another world
yeah and then we're gonna have multiple

1424
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
yeah and then we're gonna have multiple
 

1425
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,630
yeah and then we're gonna have multiple
people in that world and multiple people

1426
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
people in that world and multiple people
 

1427
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,669
people in that world and multiple people
in this one

1428
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
in this one
 

1429
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,950
in this one
yeah let's do it all right

1430
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
yeah let's do it all right
 

1431

i am so impressed with how well this

1460
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
i am so impressed with how well this
 

1461
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,230
i am so impressed with how well this
world jens

1462

world jens
 

1463
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,510
world jens
there's zero issues i was expecting

1464
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
there's zero issues i was expecting
 

1465
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,390
there's zero issues i was expecting
now i've i have no experience with

1466
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
now i've i have no experience with
 

1467
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,149
now i've i have no experience with
minecraft but i've seen

1468
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
minecraft but i've seen
 

1469
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,710
minecraft but i've seen
the lag that causes the world gen to

1470
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
the lag that causes the world gen to
 

1471
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,149
the lag that causes the world gen to
kind of

1472
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
kind of
 

1473
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,190
kind of
stutter on other servers

1474
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
stutter on other servers
 

1475
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,190
stutter on other servers
so i was expecting that because this is

1476
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
so i was expecting that because this is
 

1477
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,029
so i was expecting that because this is
just a single board computer

1478
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
just a single board computer
 

1479
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,070
just a single board computer
that's right but it's running great it's

1480
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
that's right but it's running great it's
 

1481
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,750
that's right but it's running great it's
running very very well

1482
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,760
running very very well
 

1483
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,430
running very very well
apparently this is the place to stand

1484
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
apparently this is the place to stand
 

1485
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,830
apparently this is the place to stand
i'm like safe from the rain right here

1486
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840
i'm like safe from the rain right here
 

1487
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,149

no i no it's not the cactus that killed
 

1501
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,510
no i no it's not the cactus that killed
me i had cactus in my inventory and then

1502
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
me i had cactus in my inventory and then
 

1503
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,430
me i had cactus in my inventory and then
i dropped them on the ground

1504
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
i dropped them on the ground
 

1505
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,830
i dropped them on the ground
and like i placed it on the ground on

1506
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
and like i placed it on the ground on
 

1507
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,830
and like i placed it on the ground on
top of the sand that i was standing on

1508
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
top of the sand that i was standing on
 

1509
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,390
top of the sand that i was standing on
and then the sand collapsed and then i

1510
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
and then the sand collapsed and then i
 

1511
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,990
and then the sand collapsed and then i
fell into this

1512
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
fell into this
 

1513
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,070
fell into this
um yeah you know what i'm hearing here

test
 

1579
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,510
test
and i mean this was done on a raspberry

1580
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
and i mean this was done on a raspberry
 

1581
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,350
and i mean this was done on a raspberry
pi 4 with 4 giga ram yeah

1582
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
pi 4 with 4 giga ram yeah
 

1583
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,630
pi 4 with 4 giga ram yeah
i i can only imagine how much better it

1584
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
i i can only imagine how much better it
 

1585
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,310
i i can only imagine how much better it
would be on an ak ram

1586
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
would be on an ak ram
 

1587
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,950
would be on an ak ram
because possible yeah i mean we i don't

1588
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
because possible yeah i mean we i don't
 

1589
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,630
because possible yeah i mean we i don't
we didn't tax out the ram at any point

1590
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
we didn't tax out the ram at any point
 

1591
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,710
we didn't tax out the ram at any point
no and i was watching that buffer

1592
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
no and i was watching that buffer
 

1593
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,710
no and i was watching that buffer
i was watching h top there and and and

1594
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
i was watching h top there and and and
 

1595
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,149
i was watching h top there and and and
just kind of keeping an eye on things

1596
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
just kind of keeping an eye on things
 

1597
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,190
just kind of keeping an eye on things
cpu got pretty hot at some points and

1598
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,200
cpu got pretty hot at some points and
 

1599
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,789
cpu got pretty hot at some points and
because i only overclocked i was a

1600
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:46,799
because i only overclocked i was a
 

1601
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,549
because i only overclocked i was a
little conservative in in my case

1602
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
little conservative in in my case
 

1603
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,830
little conservative in in my case
overclocking to 1.95 gigahertz um

1604
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
overclocking to 1.95 gigahertz um
 

1605
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,430
overclocking to 1.95 gigahertz um
you could go higher than that but then

1606
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
you could go higher than that but then
 

1607
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,269
you could go higher than that but then
you risk stability issues and things

1608
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
you risk stability issues and things
 

1609
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:55,909
you risk stability issues and things
like that or

1610
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
like that or
 

1611
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,630
like that or
the the single board computer crashing

1612
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
the the single board computer crashing
 

1613
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,510
the the single board computer crashing
uh but the other

1614
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
uh but the other
 

1615
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,990
uh but the other
opportunity that we have is is with the

1616
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
opportunity that we have is is with the
 

1617
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,190
opportunity that we have is is with the
raspberry pi

1618
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
raspberry pi
 

1619
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,029
raspberry pi
uh 400 which does have a stock 1.8

1620
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
uh 400 which does have a stock 1.8
 

1621
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,070
uh 400 which does have a stock 1.8
gigahertz

1622
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
gigahertz
 

1623
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,470
gigahertz
processor which we could then bump up to

1624
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
processor which we could then bump up to
 

1625
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,990
processor which we could then bump up to
maybe 2 or 2.2

1626
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
maybe 2 or 2.2
 

1627
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,590
maybe 2 or 2.2
gigahertz that might make a difference

1628
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
gigahertz that might make a difference
 

1629
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,190
gigahertz that might make a difference
so that might be cool too

1630
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
so that might be cool too
 

1631
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,909
so that might be cool too
so i mean you can do this on on the same

1632
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
so i mean you can do this on on the same
 

1633
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,669
so i mean you can do this on on the same
method can be

1634
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
method can be
 

1635
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,909
method can be
translated to any single board computer

1636
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:21,919
translated to any single board computer
 

1637
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,430
translated to any single board computer
it's just making sure that you've got

1638
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
it's just making sure that you've got
 

1639
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,750
it's just making sure that you've got
enough power and enough ram but the fact

1640
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:25,760
enough power and enough ram but the fact
 

1641
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,710
enough power and enough ram but the fact
is it worked

1642
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:26,720
is it worked
 

1643
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,110
is it worked
it worked and it really wow really well

1644
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
it worked and it really wow really well
 

1645
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,310
it worked and it really wow really well
and i mean having com

1646
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,320
and i mean having com
 

1647
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,310
and i mean having com
i mean we didn't do the comparison on

1648
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
i mean we didn't do the comparison on
 

1649
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,389
i mean we didn't do the comparison on
the show but having done it on a pi

1650
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
the show but having done it on a pi
 

1651
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,070
the show but having done it on a pi
3 and android xu4 i was expecting it to

1652
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
3 and android xu4 i was expecting it to
 

1653
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,950
3 and android xu4 i was expecting it to
not go well

1654
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
not go well
 

1655
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,350
not go well
and you mentioned that it or more timer

1656
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
and you mentioned that it or more timer
 

1657
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,870
and you mentioned that it or more timer
mentioned that it it's even working

1658
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
mentioned that it it's even working
 

1659
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,149
mentioned that it it's even working
better than the online services

1660
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
better than the online services
 

1661
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,870
better than the online services
yes yeah and i i would agree with that

how i'd use some free services
and the free services performed

1672
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
and the free services performed
 

1673
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,870
and the free services performed
worse than the pie and so you mean the

1674

that bugs me i think that
 

2487
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,030
that bugs me i think that
that bugs all of us that that kind of

2488
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
that bugs all of us that that kind of
 

2489
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,870
that bugs all of us that that kind of
thing still happens

it seems like it's a recurring theme
 

2497
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,790
it seems like it's a recurring theme
that microsoft keeps doing this where

slight linux bias comes in and we say

2510
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:43,760
slight linux bias comes in and we say
 

2511
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,670
slight linux bias comes in and we say
hey check out linux mint

2512

okay we're going to make a big change to
 

2549
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,630
okay we're going to make a big change to

we're gonna see how it goes and then we

we're gonna see how it goes and then we
 

2557

let's push that out to 30 systems and

2564
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
let's push that out to 30 systems and
 

2565
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,670
let's push that out to 30 systems and
let's see if any complaints or problems

2566
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,680
let's see if any complaints or problems
 

2567
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,309
let's see if any complaints or problems
come in

2571
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,430
and as we work through those things then
we feel confident and we can push it out

2572
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
we feel confident and we can push it out
 

2573
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,030
we feel confident and we can push it out
to the 1200 systems

2574
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
to the 1200 systems
 

2575
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,510
to the 1200 systems
right but you've got windows is on

2576
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
right but you've got windows is on
 

2577
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,349
right but you've got windows is on
probably billions of computers

2578
00:44:59,349 --> 00:44:59,359
probably billions of computers
 

2579
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,030
probably billions of computers
right so why do they not have a test

2580
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
right so why do they not have a test
 

2581
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,309
right so why do they not have a test
well why don't they run their update on

2582
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
well why don't they run their update on
 

2583
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,230
well why don't they run their update on
all of their systems one percent

2584
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
all of their systems one percent
 

2585
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,589
all of their systems one percent
of those ten systems yeah let's

2586
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
of those ten systems yeah let's
 

2587
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,150
of those ten systems yeah let's
release this update to one percent let's

2588
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,160
release this update to one percent let's
 

2589
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,510
release this update to one percent let's
see what happens

2590
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
see what happens
 

2591
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,510
see what happens
but could you i'd hate to be the one

2592
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
but could you i'd hate to be the one
 

2593
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,630
but could you i'd hate to be the one
percent

2594
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
percent
 

2595
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,190
percent
yeah but at least then they could fix it

2596
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200
yeah but at least then they could fix it
 

2597
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:23,829
yeah but at least then they could fix it
before

2598
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:23,839
before
 

2599
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,230
before
pushing it out to billions of people

2600
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
pushing it out to billions of people
 

2601
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,589
pushing it out to billions of people
yeah and i mean i'm sure

sure loosely it wasn't
 

2611
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,030
sure loosely it wasn't
every system yeah but imagine if like a

2612
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,040
every system yeah but imagine if like a
 

2613
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,790
every system yeah but imagine if like a
government defense computer was running

are a few categories of cryptocurrencies
 

2739
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,670
are a few categories of cryptocurrencies
basically three

2740
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
basically three
 

2741
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,589
basically three
the first one is bitcoin which is the

2742
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
the first one is bitcoin which is the
 

2743
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,270
the first one is bitcoin which is the
old the grand ad

2744
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:13,280
old the grand ad
 

2745
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,829
old the grand ad
that's the most stable one um that's the

2746
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:15,839
that's the most stable one um that's the
 

2747
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:16,630
that's the most stable one um that's the
one that just

2748
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:16,640
one that just
 

2749
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,069
one that just
went well above all-time high

2750
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
went well above all-time high
 

2751
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,790
went well above all-time high
and you cannot make big mistakes there

2752
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
and you cannot make big mistakes there
 

2753
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,990
and you cannot make big mistakes there
so the

2754
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,000
so the
 

2755
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,309
so the
fluctuations of course will exist there

2756
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:26,319
fluctuations of course will exist there
 

2757
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,589
fluctuations of course will exist there
and as you can

2758
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
and as you can
 

2759
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,990
and as you can
see currently we've got a dip of 25

2760
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
see currently we've got a dip of 25
 

2761
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,270
see currently we've got a dip of 25
which is absolutely normal in this

2762
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:31,280
which is absolutely normal in this
 

2763
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,150
which is absolutely normal in this
market

2764
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,160
market
 

2765
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,270
market
but you will not have those 10x or 100x

2766
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:35,280
but you will not have those 10x or 100x
 

2767
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,710
but you will not have those 10x or 100x
that you might have heard of

2768
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
that you might have heard of
 

2769
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,910
that you might have heard of
the next level is ethereum and um

2770
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:41,920
the next level is ethereum and um
 

2771
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,990
the next level is ethereum and um
then the rest falls in into the third

2772
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
then the rest falls in into the third
 

2773
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,030
then the rest falls in into the third
category so i

2774
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:45,040
category so i
 

2775
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,030
category so i
as a beginner never get involved in the

2776
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
as a beginner never get involved in the
 

2777
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,870
as a beginner never get involved in the
third category because you have to learn

2778
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:48,880
third category because you have to learn
 

2779
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,470
third category because you have to learn
first how this market

2780
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:50,480
first how this market
 

2781
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,230
first how this market
works it's a little bit like horse

2782
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:52,240
works it's a little bit like horse
 

2783
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,549
works it's a little bit like horse
racing yeah so if you go

2784
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
racing yeah so if you go
 

2785
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,430
racing yeah so if you go
to a horse race and you start betting on

2786
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:57,440
to a horse race and you start betting on
 

2787
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,069
to a horse race and you start betting on
a horse

2788
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:58,079
a horse
 

2789
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,670
a horse
then of course you will lose your money

2790
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
then of course you will lose your money
 

2791
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,670
then of course you will lose your money
if you have got no clue

2792
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
if you have got no clue
 

2793
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,549
if you have got no clue
which host horse performs which way you

2794
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:04,559
which host horse performs which way you
 

2795
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,150
which host horse performs which way you
can bet on any horse

2796
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
can bet on any horse
 

2797
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,910
can bet on any horse
and the hope that that horse will win

2798
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
and the hope that that horse will win
 

2799
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,150
and the hope that that horse will win
but the likelihood is very

2800
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
but the likelihood is very
 

2801
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,270
but the likelihood is very
small and for that you have to do some

2802
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
small and for that you have to do some
 

2803
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,069
small and for that you have to do some
research

2804
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:14,079
research
 

2805
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,910
research
and the research is also very simple

2806
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:15,920
and the research is also very simple
 

2807
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,109
and the research is also very simple
much simpler than

2808

know if there is a big potential
uh in regards to the price then here

2890
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800
uh in regards to the price then here
 

2891
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,190
uh in regards to the price then here
a little bit further up you've got the

2892
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:53,200
a little bit further up you've got the
 

2893
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,470
a little bit further up you've got the
markets

2894
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
markets
 

2895
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,910
markets
and the markets just tell you where you

2896
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:55,920
and the markets just tell you where you
 

2897
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,150
and the markets just tell you where you
can buy those and this is also important

2898
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,160
can buy those and this is also important
 

2899
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,910
can buy those and this is also important
so for example you've got uniswap here

2900
00:50:59,910 --> 00:50:59,920
so for example you've got uniswap here
 

2901
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,870
so for example you've got uniswap here
you can go

2902
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
you can go
 

2903
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,790
you can go
of course directly to unit swap and buy

2904
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:02,800
of course directly to unit swap and buy
 

2905
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,470
of course directly to unit swap and buy
it there you run

2906
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,480
it there you run
 

2907
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,430
it there you run
risk that you fall into a hoax because

2908
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
risk that you fall into a hoax because
 

2909
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,069
risk that you fall into a hoax because
not

2910
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:08,079
not
 

2911
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,030
not
everybody uh i mean you can launch a

2912
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
everybody uh i mean you can launch a
 

2913
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,309
everybody uh i mean you can launch a
celsius network

2914
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:12,319
celsius network
 

2915
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,589
celsius network
token on uh on unit swap

2916
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
token on uh on unit swap
 

2917
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,510
token on uh on unit swap
so the best way is to get to coingecko

2918
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
so the best way is to get to coingecko
 

2919
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,870
so the best way is to get to coingecko
you click on this

2920
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:18,880
you click on this
 

2921
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,750
you click on this
field here that will redirect you to

2922
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:21,760
field here that will redirect you to
 

2923
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,470
field here that will redirect you to
uniswap and there you can then exchange

2924
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
uniswap and there you can then exchange
 

2925
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,589
uniswap and there you can then exchange
your ethereum for example against

2926
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:27,599
your ethereum for example against
 

2927
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,470
your ethereum for example against
celsius tokens so that's one way the

2928
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:30,480
celsius tokens so that's one way the
 

2929
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,510
celsius tokens so that's one way the
markets

2930
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
markets
 

2931
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,870
markets
is where you find the liquidity

2932
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
is where you find the liquidity
 

2933
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,829
is where you find the liquidity
next one in regards to your research is

personally
do some research what are the people

2948
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:50,559
do some research what are the people
 

2949
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,030
do some research what are the people
that are involved are the developers

2950
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
that are involved are the developers
 

2951
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,390
that are involved are the developers
all those things next is you go into

all those things next is you go into
 

2953
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,990
all those things next is you go into
twitter or telegram

00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,000
twitter or telegram
 

2955
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,630
twitter or telegram
both not so much facebook not so much

2956
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:00,640
both not so much facebook not so much
 

2957
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,990
both not so much facebook not so much
write it but twitter is definitely

2958
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
write it but twitter is definitely
 

2959
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,430
write it but twitter is definitely
important and telegram is important

2960
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:03,440
important and telegram is important
 

2961
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,470
important and telegram is important
telegram

00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
telegram
 

2963
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,750
telegram
is people like you and i that

2964
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:07,760
is people like you and i that
 

2965
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,630
is people like you and i that
telegram is a group where they we meet

2966
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:10,640
telegram is a group where they we meet
 

2967
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,190
telegram is a group where they we meet
and

2968
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,200
and
 

2969
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,710
and
we discuss things you know so if you've

2970
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
we discuss things you know so if you've
 

2971
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,710
we discuss things you know so if you've
got a question around the celsius

2972
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
got a question around the celsius
 

2973
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,829
got a question around the celsius
network

2974
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
network
 

2975
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,430
network
regardless of what question that might

2976
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,440
regardless of what question that might
 

2977
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,750
regardless of what question that might
be you go into telegram you ask that

2978
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:19,760
be you go into telegram you ask that
 

2979
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,950
be you go into telegram you ask that
question you'll get

2980
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:20,960
question you'll get
 

2981
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,470
question you'll get
for sure a very swift answer

2982
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:24,480
for sure a very swift answer
 

2983
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,069
for sure a very swift answer
so that's telegram twitter is more of

2984
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
so that's telegram twitter is more of
 

2985
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,910
so that's telegram twitter is more of
i mean you know twitter so i don't have

2986
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
i mean you know twitter so i don't have
 

2987
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,270
i mean you know twitter so i don't have
to tell you anything about that

2988
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280
to tell you anything about that
 

2989
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,670
to tell you anything about that
so that's basically the research so the

2990
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:33,680
so that's basically the research so the
 

2991
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,630
so that's basically the research so the
research

2992
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
research
 

2993
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,829
research
revolves around um the product yeah does

2994
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:37,839
revolves around um the product yeah does
 

2995
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,670
revolves around um the product yeah does
the product appeal to you

2996
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
the product appeal to you
 

2997
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,990
the product appeal to you
then the users how many users are there

2998
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
then the users how many users are there
 

2999
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,190
then the users how many users are there
is this a coin

3000
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
is this a coin
 

3001
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,430
is this a coin
that only few users are interested in

3002
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,440
that only few users are interested in
 

3003
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,109
that only few users are interested in
then i would be careful because you know

3004
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:47,119
then i would be careful because you know
 

3005
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:47,589
then i would be careful because you know
that

3006
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:47,599
that
 

3007
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,670
that
if there are not many people involved

3008
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
if there are not many people involved
 

3009
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,230
if there are not many people involved
then it's unlikely that this thing will

3010
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,240
then it's unlikely that this thing will
 

3011
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,950
then it's unlikely that this thing will
go

3012
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960
go
 

3013
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,349
go
10x 100x or whatever and then the

3014
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
10x 100x or whatever and then the
 

3015
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,510
10x 100x or whatever and then the
utility of the coin yeah so you can what

3016
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
utility of the coin yeah so you can what
 

3017
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,109
utility of the coin yeah so you can what
can you do with it is there already an

3018
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119
can you do with it is there already an
 

3019
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,870
can you do with it is there already an
example the sample

3020
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:00,880
example the sample
 

3021
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,710
example the sample
so this is different to the traditional

3022
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:02,720
so this is different to the traditional
 

3023
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,470
so this is different to the traditional
market because the traditional market is

3024
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:04,480
market because the traditional market is
 

3025
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,670
market because the traditional market is
always around

3026
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:05,680
always around
 

3027
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,870
always around
the valuation of the company management

3028
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:08,880
the valuation of the company management
 

3029
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,430
the valuation of the company management
and also key figures of the company

3030
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:13,440
and also key figures of the company
 

3031
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,990
and also key figures of the company
yeah and you buy a share in the company

3032
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
yeah and you buy a share in the company
 

3033
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,710
yeah and you buy a share in the company
that's

3034
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
that's
 

3035
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,630
that's
completely different in this market here

3036
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
completely different in this market here
 

3037
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,710
completely different in this market here
this market is built on hype

3038
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:20,720
this market is built on hype
 

3039
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,750
this market is built on hype
uh we're currently in a bubble uh yes it

3040
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
uh we're currently in a bubble uh yes it
 

3041
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,990
uh we're currently in a bubble uh yes it
is a bubble and it will burst at one day

3042
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
is a bubble and it will burst at one day
 

3043
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,470
is a bubble and it will burst at one day
like they always do in the crypto market

3044
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,480
like they always do in the crypto market
 

3045
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,109
like they always do in the crypto market
and so

3046
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:29,119
and so
 

3047
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,990
and so
you only work towards this bubble yeah

3048
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
you only work towards this bubble yeah
 

3049
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,470
you only work towards this bubble yeah
and

3050
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:32,480
and
 

3051
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,790
and
once this bubble burst the equation is a

00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
that kind of defeats the purpose if yes
 

3295
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,750
that kind of defeats the purpose if yes
yeah so and that's something that

3296
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
yeah so and that's something that
 

3297
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,950
yeah so and that's something that
mozilla has really

3298

vpns can be very very helpful we talked

3312
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319
vpns can be very very helpful we talked
 

3313
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,950
vpns can be very very helpful we talked
about proxies on the show before

3314
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:56,960
about proxies on the show before
 

3315
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,349
about proxies on the show before
and it's sort of a similar idea but a

3316
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
and it's sort of a similar idea but a
 

3317
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,510
and it's sort of a similar idea but a
vpn allows you to basically place your

3318
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
vpn allows you to basically place your
 

3319
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:01,990
vpn allows you to basically place your
ip

3320
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,000
ip
 

3321
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,710
ip
elsewhere in the world so that means

3322
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:04,720
elsewhere in the world so that means
 

3323
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,710
elsewhere in the world so that means
even though i'm here in barrie ontario

3324
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:06,720
even though i'm here in barrie ontario
 

3325
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,589
even though i'm here in barrie ontario
canada

3326
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
canada
 

3327
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,390
canada
i can go on the internet and any website

3328
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:10,400
i can go on the internet and any website
 

3329
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,750
i can go on the internet and any website
or service that i use

3330
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
or service that i use
 

3331
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,150
or service that i use
will think that i'm in sunny california

3332
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
will think that i'm in sunny california
 

3333
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,190
will think that i'm in sunny california
yes and

3334
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,200
yes and
 

3335
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,069
yes and
so that can be good from an like a

3336
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:18,079
so that can be good from an like a
 

3337
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,150
so that can be good from an like a
privacy perspective because they can't

3338
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
privacy perspective because they can't
 

3339
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,309
privacy perspective because they can't
tell that i'm from berry ontario canada

3340
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:22,319
tell that i'm from berry ontario canada
 

3341

tell that i'm from berry ontario canada
but also it can allow me to access

3342
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
but also it can allow me to access
 

3343
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,390
but also it can allow me to access
services that i can't normally access

00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
services that i can't normally access
 

3345
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,390
services that i can't normally access
yeah up here in canada for example um

3346
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,400
yeah up here in canada for example um
 

3347
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,670
yeah up here in canada for example um
we have different services than

3348
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
we have different services than
 

3349
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,030
we have different services than

3350
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:37,040
in america yes so and sometimes it
 

3351
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,150
in america yes so and sometimes it
is crippled services and so that that

3352
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,160
is crippled services and so that that
 

3353
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,190
is crippled services and so that that
can kind of stink and

3354
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:41,200

3355
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,870
can kind of stink and
and you know maybe there's a gray area

3356
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
and you know maybe there's a gray area
 

3357

into that because
 

3361
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,069
into that because
it is a little bit of a legal gray area

3362
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:48,079
it is a little bit of a legal gray area

no i'm being blocked from it because
 

3549
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,270
no i'm being blocked from it because
it's it's like region specific that's

3550
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:51,280
it's it's like region specific that's
 

3551
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:51,670
it's it's like region specific that's
right

right
 

3553
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,589
right
and so with an international business

3554
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:53,599
and so with an international business
 

3555
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,109

didn't once say adler lake
so well done big.little in an intel

3708
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:30,960
so well done big.little in an intel
 

3709
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,549
so well done big.little in an intel
processor i mean that means

3710
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:32,559
processor i mean that means
 

3711
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,390
processor i mean that means
so we're talking multi-core processors

3712
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:34,400
so we're talking multi-core processors
 

3713
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,950
so we're talking multi-core processors
becca really broke it down and

3714
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:36,960
becca really broke it down and
 

3715
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,069
becca really broke it down and
you know i'm i'm impressed that

3716
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:40,079
you know i'm i'm impressed that
 

3717
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,950
you know i'm i'm impressed that
big.little is is really revolutionary in

big.little is is really revolutionary in
 

3719
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,510
big.little is is really revolutionary in
that

3720
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:43,520
that
 

3721
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,150
that
when i'm doing really intensive tasks i

3722
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
when i'm doing really intensive tasks i
 

3723
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,390
when i'm doing really intensive tasks i
want my system to be performing

3724
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:48,400
want my system to be performing
 

3725
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,029
want my system to be performing
at its best i don't care in that moment

3726
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
at its best i don't care in that moment
 

3727
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,390
at its best i don't care in that moment
about energy con

3728
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:52,400
about energy con
 

3729
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,230
about energy con
consumption or um uh reduction in

01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,240
consumption or um uh reduction in
 

3731
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,870

01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:58,880
energy uh however when my computer's
 

3733
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,390

whatever i don't need all that power i

3736
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,240
whatever i don't need all that power i
 

3737
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,230
whatever i don't need all that power i
don't need the heat that it generates i

3738
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
don't need the heat that it generates i
 

3739
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:04,789
don't need the heat that it generates i
don't

3740
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:04,799
don't

01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,950
don't
so big dot little means rather than

3742
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:06,960
so big dot little means rather than
 

3743
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,990
so big dot little means rather than
throttling your

3744
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
throttling your
 

3745
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,670
throttling your
processor which is the old traditional

3746
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:09,680
processor which is the old traditional
 

3747
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,990
processor which is the old traditional
intel way which is you know take a

3748
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,000
intel way which is you know take a
 

3749
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,750
intel way which is you know take a
three gigahertz processor and when

3750
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:13,760
three gigahertz processor and when
 

3751
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,430
three gigahertz processor and when
you're using it at its max it's going to

3752
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:15,440
you're using it at its max it's going to
 

3753
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,510
you're using it at its max it's going to
be 3.2 gigahertz but then

3754
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
be 3.2 gigahertz but then
 

3755
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,109
be 3.2 gigahertz but then
when you idle it's going to go down to

3756
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:19,119
when you idle it's going to go down to
 

3757
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,789
when you idle it's going to go down to
one gigahertz

3758
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:20,799
one gigahertz
 

3759
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:23,430
one gigahertz
and and so you know that's the old way

3760
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
and and so you know that's the old way
 

3761
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,190
and and so you know that's the old way
throttling

3762
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:25,200
throttling
 

3763
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,549
throttling
this is multiple cores and some of the

3764
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
this is multiple cores and some of the
 

3765
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,150
this is multiple cores and some of the
cores the little ones

3766
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
cores the little ones
 

3767
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,390
cores the little ones
are simply more energy efficient so it

3768
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:32,400
are simply more energy efficient so it
 

3769
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,230
are simply more energy efficient so it
will choose based on the task

3770
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,240
will choose based on the task
 

3771
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,789
will choose based on the task
which cores are being utilized for that

3772
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
which cores are being utilized for that
 

3773
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,510
which cores are being utilized for that
task

3774
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:37,520
task
 

3775
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,950
task
it's quite interesting and that's

3776
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
it's quite interesting and that's
 

3777
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,029
it's quite interesting and that's
something that that you know

3778
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:41,039
something that that you know
 

3779
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,630
something that that you know
arm has been doing for a long time we

3780
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:42,640
arm has been doing for a long time we
 

3781
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,150
arm has been doing for a long time we
see it on single board computers we're

3782
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160
see it on single board computers we're
 

3783
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,230
see it on single board computers we're
talking about the rock pro 64.

3784
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:46,240
talking about the rock pro 64.
 

3785
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,069
talking about the rock pro 64.
the rock pro 64 has six cores

3786
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:50,079
the rock pro 64 has six cores
 

3787
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,710
the rock pro 64 has six cores
it's a single board computer with two

3788
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:52,720
it's a single board computer with two
 

3789
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,670
it's a single board computer with two
big cores

3790
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:53,680
big cores
 

3791
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,390
big cores
and four little cores yeah and so it's

3792
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
and four little cores yeah and so it's
 

3793
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:56,950
and four little cores yeah and so it's
able to

3794
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:56,960
able to
 

3795
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,270
able to
really perform well when it needs to but

3796
01:05:59,270 --> 01:05:59,280
really perform well when it needs to but
 

3797
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,470
really perform well when it needs to but
then when it needs to be energy

3798
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,480
then when it needs to be energy
 

3799
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,430
then when it needs to be energy
efficient or

3800
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,440
efficient or
 

3801
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,430
efficient or

have
 

3821
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,430
have
felt it that way for a while with intel

3822
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440
felt it that way for a while with intel
 

3823
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,470
felt it that way for a while with intel
like for

like for
 

3825
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,750
like for
mac as well well yeah exactly but

mac as well well yeah exactly but
 

3827
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,870
mac as well well yeah exactly but
for the longest time intel was like

3828
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:30,880
for the longest time intel was like

the one to watch it was like if
 

3831
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,309
the one to watch it was like if
something new was coming out it was
